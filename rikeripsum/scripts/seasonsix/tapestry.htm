    &quot;Tapestry&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The room is in a state of frenetic activity. N.D.<br>
    NURSES and DOCTORS are rushing about, grabbing<br>
    equipment and moving consoles in preparation for some<br>
    imminent emergency. BEVERLY grabs her medical<br>
    tricorder as she directs people to action.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Nurse)<br>
    Get the stasis units in here and<br>
    bring them on-line.<br>
    (to another Nurse)<br>
    Tell Doctor Selar to use ward<br>
    three for the ambulatory cases,<br>
    I'll take the --</p>
  <p> COM VOICE<br>
    Transporter Room Four to Sickbay.<br>
    They're coming in now.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Acknowledged.<br>
    (to everyone)<br>
    Back everyone.</p>
  <p> They all clear out the center of the room as RIKER,<br>
    PICARD, WORF, and THREE N.D. CREWMEMBERS MATERIALIZE.<br>
    Worf is carrying Picard over one shoulder. Riker has<br>
    a nasty-looking head wound and is pointing his phaser<br>
    as if defending them. One N.D. is also injured and<br>
    lying on the floor, while the other two are standing up<br>
    with phasers drawn.</p>
  <p> Once the beam-in has finished, Beverly and the Nurses<br>
    rush to aid the wounded. Beverly moves to Picard as<br>
    Worf puts him down on the operating table. We can now<br>
    see that there is a large SCORCH mark on Picard's<br>
    chest. Beverly immediately begins scanning him with<br>
    her tricorder.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Lenarians attacked us outside<br>
    the conference room.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    He's in cardiac arrest.<br>
    (to Nurse)<br>
    Get the pulmonary support unit.</p>
  <p> The CLAMSHELL is moved into place over Picard's chest.<br>
    Worf and Riker move away to give them room and they<br>
    look on with concern. Beverly continues to read the<br>
    tricorder.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Internal hemorrhaging... the bioregulator<br>
    in his artificial<br>
    heart's been fused... damage to<br>
    the spleen and liver... what kind<br>
    of weapon did this?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A compressed teryon beam.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Nurse)<br>
    Forty cc's inoprovaline...</p>
  <p> An ALARM SOUNDS from the clamshell.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Activity in the isocortex is<br>
    falling. Cortical stimulator.</p>
  <p> A Nurse hands her a device, which Beverly places on his<br>
    forehead. A monitor in the room begins to show a<br>
    flatline and ALARMS are continuous now.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Now.</p>
  <p> Picard's body JERKS... then nothing.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Again.</p>
  <p> His body JERKS again... nothing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> We are now looking DOWN at the scene in Sickbay from<br>
    directly overhead... as we begin to PUSH DOWN onto<br>
    Picard's face, Beverly and the others can be seen<br>
    working frantically on him, but there is NO SOUND<br>
    except for a slowly building RUSHING NOISE, similar to<br>
    the sound of the ocean. As Picard's face fills the<br>
    frame, the rushing sound builds to a ROAR and suddenly<br>
    the scene...</p>
  <p> FADES TO WHITE.</p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>3 LIMBO</p>
  <p> SILENCE. Picard is standing in blindingly WHITE LIMBO<br>
    without walls or ceiling. He is dazed and confused...<br>
    unsure where he is or what's happening to him. He<br>
    struggles to look around, but he cannot discern<br>
    anything in this uniformly bright place. Suddenly an<br>
    even more INTENSE LIGHT fills part of the scene.<br>
    Picard holds up a hand to shield his eyes from this<br>
    painfully intense light, but he does not retreat. He<br>
    struggles to look into the light.</p>
  <p>3A POV PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The glowing luminescence has a form... it is the shape<br>
    of a FIGURE standing in the light.</p>
  <p>3B PICARD</p>
  <p> determined to find out who this is, moves toward the<br>
    silhouetted figure. He finally stops in front of it.<br>
    He can barely look into the light at all.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 THE FIGURE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> reaches out for him with one hand.</p>
  <p>5 PICARD</p>
  <p> reaches out toward the hand... they clasp hands and<br>
    suddenly...</p>
  <p>6 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> revealing Q standing with Picard, holding his hand. Q<br>
    is wearing white flowing ethereal robes.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Welcome to the afterlife, Jean-Luc.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You're dead.</p>
  <p> OFF Picard's shocked reaction...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes) </p>
  <p>7 LIMBO - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Picard angrily drops Q's hand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's going on, Q?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I told you. You're dead. This is<br>
    the afterlife. And I'm God.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are not God.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Blasphemy! You're lucky I don't<br>
    cast you out, or smite you or<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> Picard is unamused.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know what game it is<br>
    you're playing, but I am not going<br>
    to participate.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    What an ego.<br>
    (sarcastic)<br>
    Did you think the great Jean-Luc<br>
    Picard would never die?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Q, whatever you've done to --</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I haven't done anything.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Check your heart rate. Go ahead.</p>
  <p> Picard hesitates... then puts a hand to his throat...<br>
    he reacts with shock as he finds nothing.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    No pulse? What a surprise.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - REV. 12/07/92 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Try as he might to deny it, Picard is coming to the<br>
    realization that Q is on the level. But he still<br>
    fights against a facile acceptance of Q's word.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How do I know this isn't another<br>
    one of your tricks?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Think, Jean-Luc. Why would I go<br>
    to all the trouble of faking your<br>
    death when I could simply kill you<br>
    whenever I felt like it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is that what happened?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I wouldn't want to steal the<br>
    credit... it was a rather<br>
    disgruntled Lenarian actually.</p>
  <p> This strikes a chord with Picard. He begins to<br>
    remember what happened...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The conference...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (impatient)<br>
    Yes, yes. The conference, the<br>
    unexpected attack, the compressed<br>
    teryon beam... the bottom line is,<br>
    your life ended about five minutes<br>
    ago under the inept ministrations<br>
    of Doctor Beverly Crusher.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a moment to think about this. He pushes<br>
    away the idea that Q might be telling the truth.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. I am not dead. I refuse to<br>
    believe there is an afterlife<br>
    which is run by you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The universe is not that badly<br>
    designed.</p>
  <p> Q gives a bored and frustrated sigh.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Very well. If you really require<br>
    more evidence of your post-mortem<br>
    status, I'll just have to provide<br>
    some...</p>
  <p> Suddenly, Picard hears a deep VOICE coming from behind<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> MAURICE'S VOICE<br>
    Jean-Luc...</p>
  <p> Picard freezes in place at the all-too familiar voice.</p>
  <p>8 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Picard slowly turns around and sees his father, MAURICE<br>
    PICARD standing behind him. Maurice is in his<br>
    eighties, but seems healthy and vital.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    Father...</p>
  <p> Maurice is clearly disapproving.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - REV. 12/08/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MAURICE<br>
    I told you not to go running off<br>
    to that Academy. I told you that<br>
    Starfleet would bring you to a bad<br>
    end. But you wouldn't listen.<br>
    Now look at you... dead before<br>
    your time.</p>
  <p> Picard's words are meant for Q, but he can't take his<br>
    eyes off of his father's face.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right, Q... enough.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (innocent)<br>
    Enough what?</p>
  <p> MAURICE<br>
    Why couldn't you listen? Didn't<br>
    you understand that I was only<br>
    looking out for your best<br>
    interests?</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Q in rage.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (hard)<br>
    Q, stop this.</p>
  <p> MAURICE<br>
    Even now, after all these years...<br>
    you still manage to disappoint me,<br>
    Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p>9 ON PICARD</p>
  <p> The words knife through Picard. He turns back<br>
    around... but Maurice is GONE. Picard stares out into<br>
    the white emptiness for a moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - REV. 12/08/92 - ACT ONE 9-9A. </p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hope you're enjoying this, Q.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    This isn't for me. This is for<br>
    you, Jean-Luc... I wanted to give<br>
    you an opportunity to make peace<br>
    with your sordid past.</p>
  <p> Picard turns back to Q after a beat, determined not to<br>
    let Q call the tune.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I find it hard to believe that<br>
    you're doing this for the benefit<br>
    of my soul.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Now that you've finally shuffled<br>
    off the mortal coil, we're free to<br>
    spend some time together. I<br>
    simply want you to be at peace<br>
    with yourself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    &quot;Some time together?&quot;... how much<br>
    time?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Eternity.</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So I'm in hell.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    That's the spirit, Jean-Luc.<br>
    Don't let a little thing like<br>
    death slow down that rapier wit.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - REV. 12/08/92 - ACT ONE 9B.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Now you're sure you don't have any<br>
    regrets or feelings of guilt about<br>
    your former life? I can't have<br>
    you whining and complaining<br>
    through eternity.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If I'm truly dead, then my only<br>
    regret is dying... and finding you<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (mock)<br>
    You wound me, Mon Capitain. After<br>
    all, I wasn't the cause of your<br>
    death...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - REV. 12/08/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> He holds up a hand and a DEVICE APPEARS in it. It's<br>
    about the size of a softball and part of it is burnt<br>
    and fused.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (re: device)<br>
    ... this was.</p>
  <p> Picard recognizes the form, but it's still a shock.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is that...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Your artificial heart.</p>
  <p> He tosses the device to Picard, who catches it. Picard<br>
    looks down at it with a sort of horrific wonder. There<br>
    is something very strange about holding one's own<br>
    heart. He examines it closely.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You might have lived if you'd had<br>
    a real heart instead of this<br>
    unreliable piece of technology.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    How did you manage to lose yours<br>
    anyway?</p>
  <p> Picard pauses... looks at the device for a long moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    It was a... mistake.</p>
  <p> Q immediately senses that he's onto something here. He<br>
    presses Picard further.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Something you regret?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (finally admitting)<br>
    I regret a great many things from<br>
    those days...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Really?</p>
  <p> Q looks off to one side.</p>
  <p>9A OMITTED</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>10 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> In the direction Q is looking, there are now three<br>
    people standing in the dark: NAUSICAAN #1, #2, #3, and<br>
    a YOUNG PICARD. The Nausicaans are large, burly aliens<br>
    with hideous features. The Young Picard is about<br>
    twenty-one years old and is wearing an old-style<br>
    Starfleet uniform.</p>
  <p> The following happens very quickly:</p>
  <p> Young Picard has Nausicaan #1 on the ground and is<br>
    holding him in some type of wrestling lock. Nausicaan<br>
    #2 pulls a nasty-looking weapon with a long serrated<br>
    blade from his belt as Nausicaan #3 grabs Young<br>
    Picard's arms. Nausicaan #2 then DRIVES his weapon<br>
    THROUGH Young Picard's back. The Young Picard LAUGHS<br>
    just before he falls to the ground.</p>
  <p>11 ON PICARD AND Q</p>
  <p> Who have just seen the above action play out.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    It wasn't very smart of you to<br>
    take on three Nausicaans like<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> Picard walks over and stands above the still form of<br>
    his younger self which is lying on the ground. (The<br>
    Nausicaans are gone.)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, it wasn't.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    And did I hear you laugh? It's so<br>
    unlike you to have a sense of<br>
    humor... especially about getting<br>
    stabbed through the back.</p>
  <p> Picard still can't take his eyes off the image of his<br>
    younger self.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was... a different person in<br>
    those days... an arrogant,<br>
    undisciplined, young man with far<br>
    too much ego and far too little<br>
    wisdom.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I was more like you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I'm sure you were far more<br>
    interesting in those days. A pity<br>
    you had to change.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The only pity is that I had to be<br>
    impaled through the back before I<br>
    learned my lesson.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I started that fight with the<br>
    Nausicaans... I started it<br>
    because I was young and cocky...</p>
  <p> He looks down at the artificial heart he is still<br>
    holding.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If I had been more responsible at<br>
    that age... I wouldn't have needed<br>
    this heart... and I wouldn't have<br>
    died from a random energy surge<br>
    thirty years later.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    So if you had it to do all over<br>
    again... ?</p>
  <p>12 ON PICARD</p>
  <p> He looks thoughtful as he recalls the events of his<br>
    youth.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    Things would be different...</p>
  <p> We MOVE IN CLOSE on Picard's face and suddenly a<br>
    WOMAN'S HAND SLAPS him across the face.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>13 INT. STARBASE - PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>14 INT. STARBASE - PICARD'S QUARTERS (CONTINUOUS)</p>
  <p> Picard is still shocked. The angry Woman turns on her<br>
    heel and EXITS in a huff. Suddenly there is APPLAUSE<br>
    and LAUGHTER from o.c. Picard turns to see...</p>
  <p>15 COREY AND MARTA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> who are standing in the room. COREY ZWELLER is a tall,<br>
    lanky, twenty-one year old, with long hair that<br>
    probably barely passes regulations. MARTA BATANIDES is<br>
    a short, pretty woman, and is also roughly twenty-one.<br>
    They are both wearing old-style Starfleet Ensign<br>
    uniforms and the jackets are unbuttoned, suggesting a<br>
    casual gathering.</p>
  <p> Picard immediately recognizes them both, but he's still<br>
    trying to adjust to where he is. Corey and Marta are<br>
    both laughing and applauding Picard -- neither knows<br>
    that the man standing before them is not twenty-one.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    (applauding)<br>
    Bravo! Bravo!</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    (applauding)<br>
    Nicely done.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Cortan? Cortan Zweller?</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Of course it's me... boy, she<br>
    must've hit you pretty hard.</p>
  <p> Marta moves to him and jokingly pats his cheek where<br>
    the woman slapped him.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    You're slowing down, Johnny. You<br>
    should've seen that one coming.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at her with real warmth.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Marta...</p>

  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Marta frowns at him... she's starting to become<br>
    genuinely concerned.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    Are you okay?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm... just a little<br>
    disoriented...</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    Oh, please. Now he's just playing<br>
    for sympathy.</p>
  <p> Corey begins to button up his jacket.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    I want to get something to eat and<br>
    head over to the casino at<br>
    Bonestell. Who's coming?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll... catch up with you later.</p>
  <p> Marta is still concerned about Picard.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    Are you sure you're all right?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, no. I'm fine Marta -- Marty,<br>
    really.</p>
  <p> Marta still isn't quite convinced, but Corey only rolls<br>
    his eyes.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    Come on, Marty. I bet he has<br>
    another date anyway.</p>
  <p> Marta gives Picard a wry look.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    That's it, isn't it?<br>
    (pokes him in chest)<br>
    You are incorrigible.</p>
  <p> Marta begins buttoning her jacket too as she and Corey<br>
    head for the door.</p>

    Try not to end up in the hospital.</p>
  <p> They EXIT. Picard looks after them for a beat, trying<br>
    to ground himself in what's going on. He looks down at<br>
    his own uniform and notes the insignia. Q suddenly<br>
    APPEARS, wearing a normal Captain's uniform and holding<br>
    a swagger stick.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (barks)<br>
    Attention on deck, Ensign Picard!</p>
  <p> Picard almost stands at attention out of reflex before<br>
    catching himself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (irritated)<br>
    Q...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    That's Captain Q to you, young<br>
    man.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's the point of creating<br>
    this... fantasy?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    It's no fantasy. This is all very<br>
    real, I assure you. You're twenty-one<br>
    years old again... a brash<br>
    young man, fresh out of the<br>
    Academy.</p>
  <p> Picard looks down at his hands and then looks at<br>
    himself in a mirror.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't look it.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    To everyone else, you do.</p>
  <p> Picard tries to punch holes in Q's story.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I thought you said I was dead...<br>
    now you tell me I'm alive?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You mortals can be so obtuse. Why<br>
    do you persist in believing that<br>
    life and death are such static and<br>
    rigid concepts.<br>

  <p>15 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's say for the moment that it's<br>
    true... what purpose does it serve<br>
    to bring me here?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You said you regretted a great<br>
    many things from this time in your<br>
    life. Well, now you have a chance<br>
    to change some of them.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a moment to assess all this... it's a<br>
    great deal to assimilate.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Change. You mean change the past.<br>
    Q, even if you have brought me<br>
    back in time somehow... surely you<br>
    must realize that any alteration<br>
    in this timeline could have a<br>
    profound impact on the future --</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Spare me your egotistical musings<br>
    on your pivotal role in history.<br>
    Nothing you do here will cause the<br>
    Federation to collapse or the<br>
    galaxy to explode. To be blunt...<br>
    you're not that important.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I won't do it. I won't alter<br>
    history.</p>
  <p> The look on Picard's face tells Q that he's not getting<br>
    anywhere.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Oh, very well... if you attach so<br>
    much importance to the continuity<br>
    of time... I can personally<br>
    guarantee that nothing you do here<br>
    will end up hurting anyone, or<br>
    have an adverse affect on what you<br>
    know as history. The only thing<br>
    at stake here is your life and<br>
    your peace of mind.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You have my word.</p>

  <p>15 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Picard laughs in his face.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    It's bad form to laugh at one's<br>
    god. Whether you believe me or<br>
    not, you're here and you have a<br>
    second chance... what you do with<br>
    it is entirely up to you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Do you know where you are?</p>
  <p> Picard looks around for a beat and thinks back.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Starbase Earhart... we came here<br>
    just after graduation... to wait<br>
    for our first deep space<br>
    assignments.</p>
  <p> Q makes himself comfortable on a couch.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    That's right. It's two days<br>
    before your unfortunate encounter<br>
    with a Nausicaan sword... you have<br>
    that long to make whatever changes<br>
    you wish. If you can avoid<br>
    getting stabbed through the heart<br>
    this time -- which I doubt -- I'll<br>
    take you back to what you think of<br>
    as the present and you can go on<br>
    with your life... with a real<br>
    heart.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So then I won't die?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Of course you'll die. It'll just<br>
    be at a later time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What if I don't avoid the fight...<br>
    what if I don't make any changes?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Then you die on the table and we<br>
    spend eternity together.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> Q<br>
    I'm glad you think so.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I am curious about one thing...<br>
    Johnny, why did that rather<br>
    attractive woman slap you just<br>
    now? Something you said?</p>
  <p> Picard thinks back, trying to remember.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That woman's name was... Corlina.<br>
    I was supposed to take her to<br>
    dinner... on this night...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But then she found out that...<br>
    (embarrassed)<br>
    I'd made a second date with<br>
    another woman... named Penny.<br>
    Corlina was... somewhat upset.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I'm impressed. I had no idea you<br>
    could be such a cad.</p>
  <p> Picard suddenly remembers something.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Computer, what time is it?</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Sixteen eleven hours.</p>
  <p> Picard's expression sags a little and Q picks up on it<br>
    immediately.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In fact, Penny should be...<br>
    waiting for me... right now.</p>
  <p> OFF his expression.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>16 INT. BONESTELL FACILITY - BAR</p>
  <p> The bar is a dilapidated, run-down, hole in the wall<br>
    with mismatched furnishings, dirty walls, and<br>
    indifferent service. The clientele consists mostly of<br>
    passed-out bodies and disreputable figures conducting<br>
    illegal deals in the shadows.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - ACT TWO 17B.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> In short, it is exactly the kind of place to attract<br>
    young Starfleet officers fresh from the Academy and<br>
    looking for a little adventure. (NOTE: No Ferengi<br>
    should be seen in this episode. They had not been<br>
    &quot;discovered&quot; during this time period.)</p>
  <p> There is a DOORWAY off to one side which leads to a<br>
    connecting room.</p>
  <p> Picard is sitting at the bar on a stool with one leg<br>
    too short talking to a woman named PENNY. She is an<br>
    attractive woman, well into her forties and beginning<br>
    to show it. Penny has a world-weary look of experience<br>
    and she sees Picard only as a twenty-one year old.<br>
    Picard is very uncomfortable and there is a long<br>
    silence.</p>
  <p> PENNY<br>
    You're awfully quiet today. What<br>
    happened to the dashing young<br>
    Ensign from last night... the one<br>
    with the winning smile and the<br>
    smooth talk about my eyes?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nothing. I'm just a little<br>
    more... contemplative.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 12/03/92 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PENNY<br>
    And what are you contemplating?</p>
  <p> She crosses one leg over the over, exposing a good deal<br>
    of skin in the process. Picard can't help but notice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Penny, perhaps we could just...<br>
    talk for a while. I don't know<br>
    anything about you... where you<br>
    come from... what your interests<br>
    are... your last name...</p>
  <p> PENNY<br>
    (matter of fact)<br>
    I come from Rigel, my last name is<br>
    Muroc and I like men in uniform.</p>
  <p> She leans over and begins running her hand over his<br>
    thigh. Her look is openly seductive.</p>
  <p> PENNY<br>
    I think that's enough talk.</p>
  <p> At this moment, Corey and Marta walk through the Bar<br>
    area. They both give Picard knowing smiles and looks<br>
    before EXITING through the opposite DOORWAY.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Penny... I don't think it would be<br>
    fair... to you to pretend that I'm<br>
    really interested in a...<br>
    relationship right now...</p>
  <p> PENNY<br>
    Who said anything about a<br>
    relationship?</p>
  <p> She kisses him full on the mouth... then pulls away at<br>
    his lack of response. Penny considers him for a<br>
    moment... her expression hardens and an edge creeps<br>
    into her voice.</p>
  <p> PENNY<br>
    What's wrong... Don't I look as<br>
    attractive as I did last night?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What? No, not at all. You're a<br>
    very... handsome woman.</p>
  <p> PENNY<br>
    Handsome... that's something you<br>
    say to old ladies.</p>
  <p> She moves to leave, but Picard reaches out and stops<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Penny. To me you are definitely<br>
    not an old lady.</p>
  <p> Penny grabs her drink and throws it in his face.</p>
  <p> PENNY<br>
    I wasn't after your pity.</p>
  <p> She EXITS. Picard begins to wipe the drink off his<br>
    face with a hand... suddenly someone hands him a TOWEL<br>
    from behind the bar.</p>
  <p> Q'S VOICE<br>
    Penny for your thoughts?</p>
  <p>17 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Picard turns and discovers Q standing behind the bar<br>
    dressed as a Bartender. Picard takes the towel in<br>
    irritation and dries his face.</p>

  <p> Q<br>
    You never told me you were such a<br>
    lady's man.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was a puerile adolescent who let<br>
    himself be ruled by his hormones<br>
    instead of his head.</p>
  <p> There is suddenly the NOISE of a CROWD YELLING APPROVAL<br>
    coming from o.c. Picard and Q turn toward the DOORWAY.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    It seems your friends know how to<br>
    have a good time. Maybe you<br>
    should go take some lessons.</p>
  <p> Suddenly a pushy VOICE is heard coming from the other<br>
    end of the bar.</p>
  <p> MALE VOICE<br>
    (o.c.)<br>
    Hey, you! Get over here with<br>
    those drinks before I tear your<br>
    head off!</p>
  <p> Q looks over toward where the voice came from.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Excuse me.<br>
    (to o.c. customer)<br>
    Are you addressing me... ?</p>
  <p> Another CHEER can be HEARD coming from the doorway.<br>
    Picard moves toward it in curiosity.</p>

  <p>18 INT. BONESTELL FACILITY - GAMBLING CENTER</p>
  <p> If the Bar was decrepit, the Gambling Center is<br>
    disgusting with even more decay and filth. There are<br>
    various gaming devices and tables scattered around the<br>
    room, but the center is dominated by a large DOM-JOT<br>
    TABLE. Dom-Jot is a cross between billiards and craps.<br>
    People place bets on various multi-colored images on<br>
    the table as players take turns hit balls with cue<br>
    sticks. There are many bumpers and pockets and lights<br>
    come on according to the state of play.</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS and sees that the CROWD gathered around<br>
    the Dom-Jot table is cheering on Corey, who is wielding<br>
    his cue stick with professional confidence. Corey's<br>
    opponent is an ALIEN who holds his cue stick in misery.<br>
    Picard moves to stand next to Marta.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    (re: Corey)<br>
    He's winning.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    I thought you had a date.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (beat)<br>
    She... decided to leave.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    (ironic)<br>
    You're getting old, Johnny.</p>
  <p> Corey hits a final ball and a LIGHT goes on. The crowd<br>
    goes wild. The Alien opponent puts down his stick in<br>
    disgust and throws a few gold ingots on the table.<br>
    Corey triumphantly collects his winnings as the crowd<br>
    disperses to other tables.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    Thank you... thank you all...</p>
  <p> Picard and Marta move over to him.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    Very nice... forget about<br>
    Starfleet and just play Dom-Jot<br>

    now there's a game.</p>

    Play Dom-Jot... Human?</p>
  <p> He smiles a predatory smile. Picard reacts with<br>

  <p> ACT THREE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>20 INT. BONESTELL FACILITY - GAMBLING CENTER</p>
  <p> Continuous action from Act Two. Corey sizes up the<br>
    Nausicaan... thinks he sees an easy mark.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I think I could be persuaded to<br>
    play one more game.</p>
  <p> Picard moves quickly to Corey.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (quiet, urgent)<br>
    No, don't play him.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It'll cause trouble.</p>
  <p> Corey looks at him quizzically. Picard needs to think<br>
    of something quickly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He's a Nausicaan... they can be<br>
    very ill-tempered when they lose.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    (flip)<br>
    So can I.</p>
  <p> Corey turns to play, but Picard grabs his arm.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (forcefully)<br>
    Corey, listen to me. This is a<br>
    bad idea. Don't play him.</p>
  <p> Corey pulls away from Picard's grip. He looks at<br>
    Picard with a trace of irritation.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    What's gotten into you?<br>
    (to Nausicaan)<br>
    Let's go.</p>
  <p> Corey and the Nausicaan set up the table as Picard<br>
    looks on with frustration. Marta throws him a<br>
    quizzical glance, but shrugs it off and then moves to<br>
    get a good look at the game as a CROWD begins to gather<br>
    around the table again.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - ACT THREE 24.</p>
  <p>21 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Q (still dressed as the Bartender) ENTERS and moves<br>
    to stand with Picard. The game between Corey and the<br>
    Nausicaan begins in the b.g. as Q and Picard talk.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I see you've found your Nausicaan<br>
    friend.</p>
  <p> Q pointedly looks at Picard's back and chest.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You seem un-impaled so far.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sorry to disappoint you.</p>
  <p> Corey scores a point on the table and exchanges a<br>
    pleased look with Marta. The Nausicaan is unmoved and<br>
    Picard looks grim.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Ensign Zweller seems to be doing<br>
    well.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He's going to lose. The Nausicaan<br>
    is cheating.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Really? I'm beginning to like<br>
    these Nausicaans.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If history repeats itself, Corey<br>
    will figure it out later tonight<br>
    and then he'll want revenge.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    And will you help your best friend<br>
    avenge this injustice?</p>
  <p> The tables have turned in the game and the Nausicaan is<br>
    starting to pile up a series of points one after the<br>
    other.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I did the first time. I found a<br>
    way to rig the table so that Corey<br>
    could win in a rematch.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You? Cheated? Picard, I'm<br>
    impressed.</p>

  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It was a foolish mistake. The<br>
    Nausicaan and his two friends<br>
    didn't take the loss very well.<br>
    They were outraged... they wanted<br>
    a fight...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And I gave them one.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    A beautiful story...<br>
    (puts fist to his chest)<br>
    Gets you right here doesn't it?</p>
  <p> The Nausicaan is now running the table on Corey,<br>
    wracking up point after point. Corey is watching him<br>
    carefully, with anger and suspicion mixing on his face.<br>
    The Nausicaan scores the final point and the crowd<br>
    CHEERS.</p>
  <p> NAUSICAAN #1<br>
    Dom-Jot!<br>
    (as if the idea were a<br>
    joke)<br>
    Human play Dom-Jot!</p>
  <p> The Nausicaan laughs heartily and throws his stick at<br>
    Corey, who has little choice but to catch it. The<br>
    Nausicaan scoops up his winnings and EXITS. Corey's<br>
    face hardens in cold fury.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>22 INT. STARBASE - PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Corey, Marta and Picard are gathered here. Corey is<br>
    very upset.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    I've played a lot of Dom-Jot, in<br>
    a lot of places, and I've never<br>
    seen the balls roll that well for<br>
    anyone. Did you see the way he<br>
    rolled the terik into straight<br>
    nines? That's a one in a million<br>
    shot and he did it twice.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    So he was cheating...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It may have simply been<br>
    extraordinary luck.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - ACT THREE 26.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    I was watching the way he held the<br>
    cue. Every time he needed to make<br>
    a tough shot, he held the cue<br>
    close to his waist. I think he<br>
    had some kind of magnetic device<br>
    in his belt. It must've been<br>
    controlling the balls.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    (angry)<br>
    That's terrible.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    We have to get even.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    What do you have in mind?</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    We could do the same thing to him<br>
    that he did to us. Cheat. We'll<br>
    rig the table so his device will<br>
    backfire on him.</p>
  <p> Picard puts his foot down before this goes any farther.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That won't solve anything.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    It'll teach him that he can't go<br>
    around cheating Starfleet<br>
    Officers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What it will do is provoke him.<br>
    And provoking a Nausicaan is not<br>
    a good idea.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    (cocky)<br>
    I can handle him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What if he's not alone... what if<br>
    he brings some friends along next<br>
    time?</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    Well... then I guess I'll have to<br>
    depend on my friends to help me<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Corey... there must be a better<br>
    way to handle this...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - ACT THREE 27.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Corey looks at him in astonishment.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    When did you start backing away<br>
    from a good fight?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're not cadets anymore... we're<br>
    officers. We have to start...<br>
    setting a higher standard for<br>
    ourselves.</p>
  <p> Corey still can't believe he's hearing this from<br>
    Picard, but Marta has begun to agree with Picard.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    Maybe he's right... maybe this<br>
    isn't such a good idea.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    (pleading)<br>
    Look, we've only got one more day<br>
    before we all have to report to<br>
    our ships. Let's have one last<br>
    adventure together... we may not<br>
    see each other again for a long<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> Marta is on the fence, but Picard holds firm.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. I'm sorry Corey, but I won't<br>
    do it.</p>
  <p> That swings Marta's vote.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    It was a good idea, Corey... but<br>
    let's just forget about it...</p>
  <p> Corey looks at them both with amazement and<br>
    disappointment. He almost says something... then<br>
    finally just shakes his head in disgust and EXITS<br>
    without a word. There is a long beat before Marta<br>
    turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    He'll get over it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - REV. 12/03/92 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hope so.</p>
  <p> Marta smiles at him in a strangely amused sort of way.<br>
    She is seeing him a little differently now... starting<br>
    to see something very attractive about this new<br>
    attitude from Picard. He notices her look.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    Nothing... it's just that usually<br>
    you'd be the one plotting revenge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (dry)<br>
    That would be more in character,<br>
    wouldn't it?</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    Much.<br>
    (with humor)<br>
    But I always suspected you had a<br>
    hidden streak of responsibility<br>
    somewhere.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (ironic)<br>
    Maybe I'm just getting... a little<br>
    older.</p>
  <p> Marta touches the rank insignia on Picard's uniform.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    (re: insignia)<br>
    Maybe these bars are starting to<br>
    feel a little heavy, Ensign.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Ensign Picard and Ensign<br>
    Batanides... sounds weird,<br>
    doesn't it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (ironic)<br>
    It's going to take some getting<br>
    used to.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> Marta gives him a very direct look.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    It's too bad we can't get used to<br>
    it together.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at her in a little surprise. Marta<br>
    realizes that she's given voice to more than she meant<br>
    to -- she's definitely attracted to Picard as more than<br>
    just a friend. She quickly amends her statement so it<br>
    doesn't sound so intimate.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    The -- the three of us, I mean.</p>
  <p> But Picard has picked up on the subtext and is not<br>
    fooled by her hasty retreat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> They look at each other for a long moment... the sexual<br>
    tension in the room fairly crackles. But before things<br>
    progress any farther, the door CHIMES and the moment is<br>
    broken.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Q ENTERS, dressed as a delivery boy and carrying a<br>
    large arrangement of flowers.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Is there a John-Luck Pickard here?</p>
  <p> Marta gives Picard a resigned look.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    (with humor)<br>
    From one of your conquests, no<br>
    doubt. I guess some things aren't<br>
    going to change.</p>
  <p> She smiles and EXITS. Once she's gone, Q turns to<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Did I interrupt something sordid<br>
    I hope?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, you did not.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - ACT THREE 29A.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (6)</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Pity. She's quite attractive.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We were friends, nothing more.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Is that another regret I hear?</p>
  <p> Q has touched a nerve here and Picard can't deny it.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    My, my... we're simply riddled<br>
    with regrets about our youth,<br>
    aren't we?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My friendship with Marta is not<br>
    something I regret.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    But you do wish you'd been more<br>
    than just... friends, don't you?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Well... here's your chance to<br>
    change all that.</p>
  <p> Picard faces Q squarely, determined not to let Q get to<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (7)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (irritably)<br>
    What do you want, Q?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I thought you might like to know<br>
    that Mister Zweller has decided to<br>
    ignore your advice.</p>
  <p> Picard is shocked.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    He's in the Bonestell Facility<br>
    right now... rigging the table to<br>
    beat the Nausicaan. I guess you<br>
    weren't that persuasive.</p>
  <p> Picard thinks for a beat, then EXITS with a determined<br>
    look on his face. Q smiles and smells the flowers with<br>
    a satisfied look on his face.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>23 INT. BONESTELL FACILITY - GAMBLING CENTER - NIGHT</p>
  <p> The Gambling Center is closed for the evening and the<br>
    lights are off. Corey is underneath the Dam-Jot table,<br>
    working with a couple of tools when Picard quietly<br>
    ENTERS. Picard looks around quickly, but they're<br>
    clearly alone. He moves silently over to the table.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (softly)<br>
    Corey...</p>
  <p> Corey smacks his head into the table in surprise.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    Ow!</p>
  <p> Corey sees Picard and breathes a sigh of relief.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    Johnny... don't sneak up on me<br>
    like that. I thought you were the<br>
    gambling foreman.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sorry.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 12/03/92 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    It's all right. I'm glad you're<br>
    here.<br>
    (points to tool)<br>
    Hand me the magna-spanner.</p>
  <p> He leans back under the table.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not here to help you, I'm here<br>
    to stop you from making a serious<br>
    mistake.</p>
  <p> Corey looks at him in disbelief... he still isn't<br>
    taking him seriously.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    (sarcastic)<br>
    You sound like my mother.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Cheating the Nausicaan could have<br>
    serious consequences for all of<br>
    us. It's a risk we can't afford<br>
    to take.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    You are my mother.<br>
    (mocking)<br>
    Well, Mom... gee, I guess I'll<br>
    have to go tell the Nausicaans I<br>
    don't mind if they cheat me --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (hard)<br>
    This isn't a joke, Corey.</p>
  <p> The humor fades from Corey's face.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    It better be.</p>
  <p> A tense beat between the two of them. Corey finally<br>
    breaks the silence... he keeps his voice low and very<br>
    even.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    Now, I'm going to finish my work<br>
    here. If you want to help me --<br>
    fine. If you don't, then I'll see<br>
    you back at the Starbase.</p>
  <p> Corey turns back to the table, but Picard takes him<br>
    gently but firmly by the arm.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I said you're not doing this.</p>
  <p> Picard's expression is unyielding. Corey looks from<br>
    Picard's face down to the hand on his arm.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    Are you going to hit me, Johnny?</p>
  <p> Picard considers him for a beat... realizes that he<br>
    won't cross that line with his friend. Picard drops<br>
    his hand after a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I will tell the gambling<br>
    foreman that someone's been<br>
    tampering with his Dom-Jot table.</p>
  <p> Corey can't even put his sense of betrayal and anger<br>
    into words. He stares at Picard for a long beat...<br>
    then drops the tool in his hand.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    (cold)<br>
    All right, have it your way...<br>
    (with contempt)<br>
    ... Ensign Picard.</p>
  <p> With a pained and angry look, Corey EXITS, leaving<br>
    Picard alone in the deserted center.</p>

  <p>24 INT. STARBASE - MARTA'S QUARTERS - NIGHT</p>
  <p> A redress of Picard's Quarters. Marta has taken her<br>
    jacket off and is sitting on the edge of the bed,<br>
    listening to Picard, who is upset about the prior<br>
    scene.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I just couldn't make him<br>
    understand.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    At least he did finally give it<br>
    up...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, but... he didn't take it very<br>
    well.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    Oh, you know Corey... he'll forget<br>
    all about it by tomorrow.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hope so. We were friends for<br>
    many years after this.<br>
    (off her look)<br>
    Or at least... I hope we will be.</p>
  <p> Marta looks at him for a moment... a smile keeps<br>
    playing about her lips as if she is about to burst out<br>
    laughing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    You keep smiling at me.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    (light)<br>
    I've just never seen you like this<br>
    before. You're so... serious.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do I really seem that different?</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I don't know... maybe I'm just not<br>
    used to seeing you in an officer's<br>
    uniform...<br>
    (beat, then more<br>
    thoughtful)<br>
    No... it's more than that... you<br>
    do seem different...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I mean, I'm not complaining... I<br>
    think it suits you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Marta gives him a very direct look... and that spark of<br>
    sexual tension can be felt in the room again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Really?</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    Yes. I think it's very...<br>
    (she hesitates)<br>
    ... attractive.</p>
  <p> There is another silent moment as they search each<br>
    other's expression. The tension between them begins to<br>
    build. Picard struggles with the feelings, begins to<br>
    turn away in order to break the moment... but Marta<br>
    stops him.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    Johnny... have you ever thought<br>
    about us... getting together?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Actually... I have. For a long<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> There is a charged silence. Picard is trying to<br>
    resist, uncomfortable with the fact that, for him, many<br>
    years have passed.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    Why didn't you ever say so?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I... don't know.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    At the moment... I can't imagine<br>
    why I didn't...</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    Well... you've said it now.</p>
  <p> They hold each other's eyes for a moment... then Marta<br>
    takes a step toward him... she lifts a hand and brushes<br>
    her fingertips across his lips... then carefully moves<br>
    closer... their lips touch briefly in a tentative kiss.<br>
    They part slightly and look at each other again... then<br>
    they kiss in a deep and passionate embrace.</p>

  <p> CLOSE ON Picard, who is sleeping in the bed alone.<br>
    It's the next morning. A HAND reaches out and strokes<br>
    his face gently... Picard smiles and slowly rolls<br>
    over... he opens his eyes and finds Q lying on top of<br>
    the covers next to him.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Good morning, darling.</p>
  <p> Picard jerks back in shock. Q smiles as Picard grabs<br>
    his uniform and begins to dress.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    A little jumpy this morning, are<br>
    we? Feeling guilty perhaps?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't have anything to feel<br>
    guilty about, Q.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    No?<br>
    (mocking)<br>
    &quot;We were friends, Q. Nothing<br>

    You're the one who gave me the<br>
    opportunity to change things...</p>

    I'm sure.</p>
  <p> Q VANISHES.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>26 INT. BONESTELL FACILITY - BAR - DAY</p>
  <p> It's still pretty early in the day for there to be many<br>
    customers at the bar. Picard ENTERS and looks around<br>
    for a beat before seeing Marta sitting at a far table<br>
    with her back toward him. Picard smiles and moves to<br>
    her. He puts a hand on her shoulder and gently kisses<br>
    her head.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Morning.</p>
  <p> Marta stiffens in her seat.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    Johnny.</p>
  <p> Picard moves around and suddenly sees the expression on<br>
    her face -- she looks miserable and has probably been<br>
    crying recently. Picard sits down with concern.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's wrong?</p>
  <p> A long beat as Marta tries to put words together. She<br>
    toys with a mug of coffee in front of her and has a<br>
    great deal of difficulty meeting Picard's eyes. She<br>
    tries to smile.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    Well... this is the morning after,<br>
    huh?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - ACT FOUR 37.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard is suddenly in uncharted waters. He wasn't<br>
    expecting this reaction from her and he's not sure how<br>
    to deal with it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I suppose so.</p>
  <p> An awkward beat.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    I... don't quite know where to<br>
    begin...</p>
  <p> He takes her hand gently.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Marta... I don't regret what<br>
    happened last night... and I hope<br>
    you don't, either.</p>
  <p> She looks into his eyes, but her emotions are in<br>
    turmoil.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    I don't know... we've been friends<br>
    for a long time... and now...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hope last night has only brought<br>
    us closer.</p>
  <p> A long beat as Marta looks down into her coffee.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    Do you remember the first day we<br>
    reported to the Academy?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> MARTA<br>
    They marched us into Scobee Hall<br>
    in our stiff new uniforms... and<br>
    then Admiral Silona gave us the<br>
    old welcome aboard speech.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He said, I want you all to look to<br>
    the left of you and then look to<br>
    the right of you...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (remembering)<br>
    ... One of you isn't going to make<br>
    it through the next four years.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    I remember thinking... that's me.<br>
    I'm not going to make it. Then I<br>
    looked to my right... and there<br>
    you were with this cocky look on<br>
    your face... and you said, &quot;we'll<br>
    see about that.&quot; From that<br>
    moment, I knew I wanted you as a<br>
    friend.</p>
  <p> She looks into his eyes... her face fills with pain.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    And now... I'm afraid we've ruined<br>
    that friendship.</p>
  <p> Picard realizes what a profound mistake this has been.<br>

    that this never happened and try<br>
    to...</p>
  <p> He trails off as she shakes her head.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    I wish I could. It would make it<br>
    easier to say good-bye tomorrow.<br>
    (takes deep breath)<br>
    We're all supposed to get together<br>
    later... the last big night on the<br>
    town before we ship out... now I'm<br>
    not sure it's such a good idea...</p>

    I don't want you to do anything<br>
    that'll be uncomfortable...</p>

  <p>27 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Revealing Q standing near Picard.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Let's see... in the past twenty-four<br>
    hours, you've managed to get<br>
    slapped by one woman, have a drink<br>
    thrown in your face by another,<br>
    and alienate your two best<br>
    friends. I'd say you're doing<br>
    quite nicely so far.</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't respond... his thoughts are still on the<br>
    scene with Marta.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Just one more thing to do... avoid<br>
    getting stabbed through the heart<br>
    tonight.</p>
  <p> Picard nods to himself... he's ready for this to end.</p>

  <p>28 INT. BONESTELL FACILITY - GAMBLING CENTER - NIGHT</p>
  <p> The Gambling Center is bustling with activity again.<br>
    Picard, Corey, and Marta are sitting at a table in one<br>
    of the corners. There is an awkward tension between<br>
    the three of them and the drinks before them go largely<br>
    untouched. A few beats of silence go by, then Picard<br>
    tries to get the conversation going.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Corey)<br>
    I think you'll like serving aboard<br>
    the Ajax... I understand Captain<br>
    Narth is an excellent officer.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    (not really responsive)<br>
    So I hear.</p>
  <p> Another awkward silence. Marta glances at Picard, then<br>
    looks away. The tension is heavy. Picard tries one<br>
    last time to break the ice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (lifts a glass)<br>
    Well... here's to the class of<br>
    'twenty-seven.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - REV. 12/07/92 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Corey and Marta try to smile as they all clink glasses<br>
    and drink. As Corey drinks, he notices something at<br>
    the far end of the room.</p>
  <p>29 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> which shows Nausicaans #1, #2, and #3 all ENTER the<br>
    gambling center. Corey puts down his drink at the<br>
    sight of the three burly aliens. Picard and Marta<br>
    follow his gaze just as Nausicaan #1 sees Corey at the<br>
    table. Corey tries to ignore the Nausicaans and forces<br>
    himself to look down at his drink. But Nausicaan #1<br>
    moves over to the table and his two companions follow<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> NAUSICAAN #1<br>
    (taunting)<br>
    Play Dom-Jot, Human? Give you a<br>
    better chance.<br>
    (no response)<br>
    Give you a bigger stick maybe.</p>
  <p> The Nausicaans laugh. Corey slowly looks up at them<br>
    and Picard stands up to intercede.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't think we're interested.</p>
  <p> NAUSICAAN #1<br>
    (to others)<br>
    They are Undari.<br>
    (to Corey)<br>
    Cowards.</p>
  <p> Corey and Marta stand up.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    What did you say?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - REV. 12/07/92 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard gets between them.</p>
  <p> NAUSICAAN #1<br>
    (to Corey)<br>
    Coward. Like all Starfleet. You<br>
    talk and you talk... but you have<br>
    no guramba.</p>
  <p> Corey takes a step toward him.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    Why don't we find out --</p>
  <p> Picard puts a hand to his chest and keeps them apart.<br>
    Picard notices as Nausicaan #2 puts a hand on the hilt<br>
    of his sword.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Corey)<br>
    Don't be a fool.<br>
    (to Nausicaan)<br>
    There are plenty of other people<br>
    to play Dom-Jot. Go on about your<br>
    business.</p>
  <p> The Nausicaan ignores him and looks from Corey to<br>
    Marta.</p>
  <p> NAUSICAAN #1<br>
    (to Marta)<br>
    Maybe I play with you... give you<br>
    a good time.</p>
  <p> That tears it for Corey. The following happens very<br>
    quickly:</p>
  <p> Picard sees Nausicaan #2 begin to draw his weapon as<br>
    Corey cocks back his arm to throw a punch. Picard<br>
    throws an elbow into Corey's chest, knocking him<br>
    backward and preventing him from starting a fight.<br>
    Corey is caught completely by surprise and he tumbles<br>
    hard over the table and chair. There is a beat of<br>
    shocked silence from everyone.</p>
  <p> Suddenly the Nausicaans begin to laugh at the spectacle<br>
    of the quarreling officers. The tension is broken as<br>
    they go off to another area of the gambling center.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>

    Orcho lok resnik Starfleet...</p>
  <p> As they move away, Picard turns around to see Marta<br>
    helping Corey up. Picard holds out a hand, but Marta's<br>
    eyes flash at him.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    You've done enough.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Corey, I'm sorry. He was drawing<br>
    a weapon...</p>
  <p> He trails off as Corey gets to his feet and takes a<br>
    step toward him. The anger and pain in Corey's eyes is<br>
    obvious. For a moment, it looks as if Corey might<br>
    actually hit Picard. But in the end he just speaks<br>
    softly and firmly.</p>
  <p> COREY<br>
    I don't know who you are<br>
    anymore... but you're not my<br>
    friend.</p>
  <p> The words wound Picard just as surely as if Corey had<br>
    hit him. Corey walks away. Marta holds Picard's eyes<br>
    for a moment.</p>
  <p> MARTA<br>
    Good-bye, Johnny.</p>
  <p> Marta EXITS. Picard is left standing alone in the<br>
    gambling center as his two best friends in the world<br>
    walk out of his life. Q moves into view and stands<br>
    next to Picard.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    Congratulations, Mon Capitain.<br>
    You did it.</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't respond to Q. Suddenly we HEAR Worf<br>

  <p> Picard is standing near the aft science station and<br>
    Worf is standing next to him. Picard is wearing a blue<br>
    uniform with the rank of Lieutenant and he is holding<br>
    a PADD. DATA is sitting at the aft station. Worf<br>
    impatiently repeats his question.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Can I help you, Mister Picard?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Worf...</p>
  <p> Picard is confused by the transition and he takes a<br>
    moment to get his bearings. Worf finally takes the<br>
    PADD out of his hand. Data turns around in curiosity.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off PADD)<br>
    This is not for me. You should<br>
    take it to Commander La Forge in<br>
    Engineering.</p>
  <p> Worf gives the PADD to Picard and turns back to his<br>
    console. Picard looks down at his uniform in surprise.</p>

    What's happened... ?</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Beverly, something's happened to<br>
    me. I'm not sure --</p>

    I've done exactly what I promised,<br>
    Jean-Luc. I've returned you to<br>
    the present.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is not the present I<br>
    remember. You said nothing would<br>
    change.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    And nothing has changed... except<br>
    for you. But then, that's what<br>
    you wanted, wasn't it? To change<br>

  <p> GEORDI and an N.D. ENGINEER are working near the pool<br>
    table as Picard (still in blue uniform) ENTERS, still<br>
    carrying his PADD. Everything and everyone is exactly<br>
    as it should be except for Picard. He looks around the<br>
    familiar scene... unsure how to respond to all this.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Engineer)<br>
    ... so tell Duffy that we'll need<br>
    to adjust the main deflector later<br>
    this afternoon. Oh, and have him<br>
    look into that inducer problem.</p>
  <p> The Engineer nods and walks away. Geordi finally<br>
    notices Picard. There is a change in how Geordi and<br>
    everyone else knows and thinks about Picard: to them<br>
    he's no longer the mighty captain, to them he's a mildmannered,<br>
    slightly nerdy guy... similar to the way they<br>
    view Barclay.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (moving to pool table)<br>
    Hi, Jean-Luc. What's new in<br>
    astrophysics?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Do you need something?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (remembering PADD)<br>
    I have the... spectral analysis<br>
    for you.</p>
  <p> He hands Geordi the PADD. Geordi glances at it briefly<br>
    then sets it down. He's in the middle of something and<br>
    the PADD isn't that important.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Thanks.<br>
    (to Engineer)<br>
    Lynch, try shunting the power<br>
    through the lateral conduit.</p>
  <p> The woman nods and works. Geordi moves to his office.<br>
    Picard can't help but follow to see what's going on...<br>
    he's used to knowing everything that's happening aboard<br>
    this ship. Geordi sits at his panel and frowns at the<br>
    display.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's going on?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (distracted)<br>
    Oh, something's causing a power<br>
    spike in the starboard warp coil.<br>
    If I don't track it down soon, the<br>
    Captain's going to have my head on<br>
    a platter.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Have you tried flushing the<br>
    transfer conduits with trioxina?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (dismissive)<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Geordi stands and moves to another console and begins<br>
    to work. Picard continues to try helping.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The conduits sometimes get blocked<br>
    by neutrino emissions when the<br>
    plasma --</p>
  <p> Geordi smiles, puts his arm around Picard, and gives<br>
    him a polite brush-off.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hey... I know you're trying to<br>
    make full Lieutenant this year...<br>
    but I think we can handle this<br>
    from here.</p>

  <p> Picard ENTERS and looks around. After a beat, he sees<br>
    Riker and TROI seated at a table near the window. He<br>
    goes over to them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Am I interrupting?</p>
  <p> They look up. They, like Geordi, are not intimate<br>
    friends with this man and are a little surprised to be<br>
    approached by him. They exchange glances.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not at all. Have a seat.</p>
  <p> Picard sits down.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    I wonder if I could talk with you<br>
    for a moment... about my future on<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Of course, Lieutenant. Jean-Luc,<br>
    isn't it?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, please Counselor... I would<br>
    very much like to hear your<br>
    thoughts...</p>
  <p> They sit back and look at him expectantly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    First of all... I'd like you to be<br>
    straightforward with me. How do<br>
    you evaluate me as an officer?</p>
  <p> They exchange glances again.</p>

    Your performance reports have<br>
    always been good. You're<br>

  <p> Another beat. They acquiesce.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I would like to try... to move<br>
    beyond astrophysics... into<br>
    engineering or security perhaps.<br>

    well, Commander?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    I'd have to agree with the<br>
    Counselor. You talk about wanting<br>
    more... but when it comes to doing<br>
    something about it, you hang back.<br>
    If you want to get ahead, you have<br>
    to take chances... stand out from<br>

    person. That man is bereft of<br>
    passion and imagination. That's<br>
    not who I am.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Au contraire. He's the person you<br>
    wanted to be... one who was less<br>
    arrogant, and undisciplined as a<br>
    youth.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    One who was less like me.</p>
  <p> A beat as Picard realizes that Q is right. Q takes the<br>
    opportunity to rub it in.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    The Jean-Luc Picard you wanted to<br>
    be, the one who did not fight the<br>
    Nausicaan, had quite a different<br>
    career from the one you remember.<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 12/01/92 - ACT FIVE 48E.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Q (Cont'd)<br>
    That Picard never had a brush with<br>
    death... never came face to face<br>
    with his own mortality... never<br>
    realized how fragile life is...<br>
    how important each moment can<br>
    be... so his life never came into<br>
    focus. He drifted through much of<br>
    his career, with no plan or<br>
    agenda... going from one<br>
    assignment to the next, never<br>
    seizing the opportunities that<br>
    presented themselves...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He didn't lead the Away Team on<br>
    Milika Three to save that<br>
    ambassador... he didn't take<br>
    charge of the Stargazer's Bridge<br>
    when its Captain was killed...<br>
    and no one ever offered him a<br>
    command.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He learned to play it safe. And<br>
    he never, ever got noticed by<br>
    anyone.</p>
  <p> A beat as Picard is forced to admit that Q was right<br>
    all along.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 12/01/92 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're right. You gave me the<br>
    chance to change and I took that<br>
    opportunity. But I freely admit<br>
    now that it was a mistake.</p>
  <p> Q's eyes sparkle for a moment.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Are you asking me for something,<br>
    Jean-Luc?</p>
  <p> Picard swallows his pride.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Give me a chance to put things<br>
    back to the way they were before.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Before, you died in Sickbay. Is<br>
    that what you want?</p>
  <p> Picard thinks for a moment, but he's determined.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I would rather die as the man I<br>
    was... than live the life I just<br>
    saw.</p>
  <p> They look at each other for a long beat. Q seems to be<br>
    waiting for something. Finally Picard breaks the<br>
    silence.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Please.</p>
  <p> Q smiles a self-satisfied smile as we suddenly...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>36 INT. BONESTELL FACILITY - GAMBLING CENTER</p>
  <p> Picard is standing between Corey and Nausicaan #1. He<br>
    has been put back into the scene from Act Four during<br>
    the confrontation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 11/30/92 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> NAUSICAAN #1<br>
    (to Corey)<br>
    Coward. Like all Starfleet. You<br>
    talk and you talk... but you have<br>
    no guramba.</p>
  <p> This time before Corey can respond, Picard looks up<br>
    into the eyes of the Nausicaan.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What did you say?</p>
  <p> Nausicaan #1 looks down at him in surprise... this<br>
    human had been pretty conciliatory until now.</p>
  <p> NAUSICAAN #1<br>
    I said you are a coward.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's what I thought you said.</p>
  <p> Without a word Picard HITS the Nausicaan right in the<br>
    face. The Nausicaan fairly explodes with rage. With<br>
    a throaty ROAR, he swings at Picard, who manages to<br>
    duck out of the way and deliver a swift blow to the<br>
    Nausicaan's midsection. Marta and Corey quickly join<br>
    in and a brief melee ensues as the six of them knock<br>
    each other about and destroy half the furniture in the<br>
    place.</p>
  <p>37 PICARD</p>
  <p> Manages to hold his own for a while... taking on one,<br>
    then another of the giant warriors in turn. There is<br>
    a sense in his actions and bearing that he is enjoying<br>
    this fight... enjoying it as he did when it originally<br>
    happened many years ago.</p>
  <p> Then (repeating the action seen in Act One) Picard gets<br>
    Nausicaan #1 on the ground in a wrestling lock.<br>
    Nausicaan #2 pulls a nasty-looking weapon with a long<br>
    serrated blade from his belt as Nausicaan #3 grabs<br>
    Picard's arms. Nausicaan #2 then DRIVES his weapon<br>
    THROUGH Picard's back.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 12/01/92 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>38 ON PICARD'S FACE</p>
  <p> As the serrated metal blade comes out of his chest.<br>
    Picard drops to his knees and lets out a LAUGH of pure<br>
    joy before falling to the ground...</p>
  <p> MATCH CUT TO:</p>
  <p>39 INT. SICKBAY - ON PICARD'S FACE</p>
  <p> He is laughing, still on the operating table as seen in<br>
    the Teaser.</p>
  <p>40 WIDER</p>
  <p> Revealing Beverly, Worf, and Riker looking on in<br>
    puzzlement. Only a few minutes have passed since the<br>
    events seen in the Teaser. Beverly is leaning over him<br>
    with a medical DEVICE.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (off monitor)<br>
    His vital signs are stabilizing...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Captain... ? Jean-Luc... ?</p>
  <p> Picard's eyes open at last and he looks up at Beverly,<br>
    still smiling.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You've been injured... but I think<br>
    it's going to be all right.</p>
  <p> Picard's surprised at being here at all. With a final<br>
    chuckle, he closes his eyes. The others all exchange<br>
    glances.</p>

  <p>42 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard is finishing a long talk with Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... I still don't know what to make<br>
    of it all. Was it a dream? Or<br>
    one of Q's elaborate tricks?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tapestry&quot; - 12/01/92 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A lot of people who've been near<br>
    death have talked about strange<br>
    experiences... but they're not<br>
    usually so detailed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Part of me cannot accept the idea<br>
    that Q would have given me a<br>
    second chance... that he would<br>
    demonstrate that much...<br>
    compassion.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But if it was Q... I owe him a<br>
    debt of gratitude.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    In what sense? It sounds like he<br>
    put you through hell.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There were many things in my youth<br>
    that I'm not proud of... they were<br>
    loose threads... untidy parts of<br>
    myself that I wanted to remove.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But when I pulled on one of those<br>
    threads... I unravelled the<br>
    tapestry of my life.</p>
  <p> Riker smiles at some inner joke.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (off Picard's look)<br>
    I was just trying to imagine you<br>
    as a hell-bent-for-leather young<br>
    officer insulting a Nausicaan<br>
    twice your size. I wish I'd<br>
    gotten a chance to meet that Jean-Luc<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles and leans back in his chair. He's more<br>
    at ease discussing this part of his life than he ever<br>
    has been before... a small demon has been put to rest<br>
    and he can talk about his youth with a new joy and<br>
    pride.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, to tell the truth... that<br>
    wasn't the first time I'd had a<br>
    run-in with a couple of surly<br>
    Nausicaans...</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Really?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh, yes...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    During my sophomore year I was<br>
    assigned to do some training on<br>
    Morikin Seven. Well, there was a<br>
    Nausicaan outpost on one of the<br>
    outlying asteroids...</p>

  <p> Picard and Riker are sitting in the Observation Lounge<br>
