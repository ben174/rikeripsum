  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>A1 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> RIKER is sitting on a bed, a nasty-looking SCRATCH on<br>
    the side of his face. BEVERLY is scanning his face<br>
    with a medical tricorder.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You really did it this time, Wil.<br>
    It's not just a scrape... it's a<br>
    deep cut.</p>
  <p> Riker tries to move his face, winces in pain. Beverly<br>
    picks up a healing DEVICE and starts to wave it around<br>
    his face, HEALING THE WOUND.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can heal it... but it would<br>
    serve you right if I didn't.</p>
  <p> Riker gives her a look.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You can't keep playing Parises<br>
    Squares like you're twenty-one<br>
    years old. One of these days<br>
    you're going to fall and break<br>
    your neck... and I won't be able<br>
    to heal that so easily.</p>
  <p> Riker looks a little sheepish through all this.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Actually... I wasn't playing<br>
    Parises Squares...</p>
  <p> Beverly continues the healing process.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Mmm... Worf's calisthenic program<br>
    again...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> Beverly cocks an eye at him, her interest piqued.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Timescape&quot; - REV. 04/06/93 - TEASER 1AA.</p>
  <p>A1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Oh? What were you doing?</p>
  <p> Riker is embarrassed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I was trying to feed Spot.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Data's cat?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I told Data I'd feed it while he<br>
    was away...</p>
  <p> Riker is disgruntled.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All I remember is setting down the<br>
    food... and then a hissing ball of<br>
    fur came out of nowhere.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I hate cats.</p>
  <p> Beverly completes her scan.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You've just got to know how to<br>
    handle them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe you'd like to feed Spot.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'd be happy to...</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Commander Riker to the Bridge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (taps combadge)<br>
    On my way.</p>
  <p> Riker stands, heads for the door. He gets an idea and<br>
    stops, reaches into a nearby medical drawer -- and<br>
    pulls out a phaser.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Oh, and Doctor...</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Timescape&quot; - REV. 04/06/93 - TEASER 1AB.</p>
  <p>A1 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're going to need this.</p>
  <p> Riker tosses her the phaser, and EXITS. OFF Beverly's<br>
    amused look...</p>
  <p>B1 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> WORF at tactical; N.D.S. at various positions. Riker<br>
    ENTERS and moves to Command.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Report.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are picking up a distress call<br>
    on the long range sensors.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It is Romulan, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Romulan?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off console)<br>
    They claim they have suffered a<br>
    complete engine failure. Their<br>
    power levels are dropping... and<br>
    their life support is failing.<br>
    (dubious)<br>
    It could be a trick.</p>
  <p> Riker considers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How long until our rendezvous with<br>
    Captain Picard?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Approximately thirteen hours.</p>
  <p> Riker makes the choice -- it's a risk.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Set course for the Romulan ship,<br>
    Mister Worf.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Raise our shields, and go to Red<br>
    Alert. I want to be ready for<br>
    anything.</p>
  <p> OFF Riker's tension...</p>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 46944.2.<br>
    Commander Data, Mister La Forge,<br>
    Counselor Troi and I are en route<br>
    to the Enterprise, after attending<br>
    a three day conference on the<br>
    psychological effects of long-term<br>
    deep space assignments.</p>
  <p>2 INT. RUNABOUT - COCKPIT</p>
  <p> DATA is at the controls. He hits a few controls.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    Computer -- activate automatic<br>
    helm control.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Helm control activated.</p>
  <p> Data stands and moves to the rear of the ship...</p>
  <p>3 INT. RUNABOUT - LIVING SECTION (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> This is a NEW SET: A large room with a table, chairs,<br>
    a couple of beds and a console. PICARD, GEORDI and<br>
    TROI are seated around the table, finishing the<br>
    remnants of a sparse lunch: a BOWL OF FRUIT,<br>
    sandwiches, drinks, etc. The mood is fun, light. Data<br>
    ENTERS and joins the conversation.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    So just as I'm leaving the<br>
    reception, a Ktarian walks up to<br>
    me and says...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Timescape&quot; - REV. 04/02/93 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Troi impersonates someone's voice:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    &quot;So Diane... I understand you're<br>
    an empath. I'm a very...<br>
    sensitive man myself. I'm doing<br>
    a thesis on interspecies mating<br>
    rituals. Would you care to join<br>
    me in some empirical research?&quot;</p>
  <p> Picard and Geordi laugh.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Don't tell me -- Doctor Mizan.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    That's right.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    He's notorious. But he really is<br>
    an expert on interspecies mating<br>
    practices.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Did you help him with his<br>
    research, Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Absolutely not.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But I thought that topic<br>
    interested you.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (awkward)<br>
    Yes... but...</p>
  <p> Picard jumps in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll explain it to you later,<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Timescape&quot; - REV. 04/02/93 - TEASER 1B.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> The others exchange an amused look. Troi takes a seat<br>
    at the table.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    What did you think of the rest of<br>
    the conference?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    To be honest... I was bored. I<br>
    spent most of my time in Doctor<br>
    Wagner's phylobiology seminar.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I thought the idea of a seminar<br>
    was that we would all<br>
    participate... bring different<br>
    points of views to the<br>
    discussion...</p>
  <p> (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Timescape&quot; - REV. 03/30/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He gathered two hundred scientists<br>
    from all over the Federation...<br>
    and all he did was put us to<br>
    sleep.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    I have a memory record of the<br>
    entire lecture, Counselor. I can<br>
    repeat the portions you missed, if<br>
    you --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    No thank you, Data.</p>
  <p> Picard leans back in his chair, fatigued.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It wasn't any better at the<br>
    physiognomy workshop. Doctor<br>
    Vassbinder gave an hour long<br>
    dissertation on the ionization<br>
    effect of warp nacelles -- before<br>
    he realized the topic was supposed<br>
    to be psychology.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Why didn't somebody tell him?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There was never an opportunity --<br>
    never a pause. He just kept<br>
    talking... like he was speaking<br>
    in one incredibly long, run-on<br>
    sentence.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It was almost... hypnotic.</p>
  <p> Troi smiles. They continue to eat and drink, trying to<br>
    relax.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, I had a good time. The warp<br>
    energy symposium was fascinating.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I actually got the chance to touch<br>
    a plasma field.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Really. What was it like?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Timescape&quot; - 03/29/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Geordi gestures with his hands, trying to describe it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Incredible. I could feel the<br>
    plasma crawling up my arm. It was<br>
    warm... and it gave off a<br>
    tingling sensation that --</p>
  <p> Suddenly, inexplicably, everyone except Troi FREEZES IN<br>
    MID-MOTION -- AS IF TIME HAS STOPPED. COMPLETELY<br>
    MOTIONLESS. Geordi in mid-speech and gesture. Picard<br>
    with a cup of tea half-way to his mouth. Data<br>
    listening, face placid. It's like a picture-still<br>
    photograph.</p>
  <p> Troi reacts, stunned by the sight.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Data... ?</p>
  <p> A moment later, TIME RESUMES. Everyone CONTINUES THEIR<br>
    MOTION as if nothing is wrong. Only Troi has noticed<br>
    what happened.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing dialogue)<br>
    -- went all the way down my chest.<br>
    It was kind of like taking a bath<br>
    in pure energy.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It was not painful?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not at all. In fact...</p>
  <p> Geordi notices that Troi looks shaken.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Is there something wrong,<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> The conversation stops. All attention to Troi.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm... not sure...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Timescape&quot; - 03/29/93 - TEASER 4.</p>

  <p>4 EXT. SPACE - RUNABOUT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse.</p>
  <p>5 INT. RUNABOUT - LIVING SECTION</p>
  <p> A few minutes later. Troi is on her feet, confused,<br>
    trying to make sense out of what happened. Geordi<br>
    scans Picard with a medical tricorder... then scans<br>
    Troi. Data looks on.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    Our bio-scans check out. There<br>
    are no physiological anomalies.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If something did happen, it didn't<br>
    leave any biological traces.</p>
  <p> Troi looks troubled. Picard tries to help her<br>
    remember.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    How long did it appear to you that<br>
    we were... frozen?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't know... four, maybe five<br>
    seconds. You just... stopped...<br>
    and then started again...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I can't explain it...</p>
  <p> Data thinks.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    My memory record does not indicate<br>
    a pause or disruption during that<br>
    period of time.</p>
  <p> Data turns and works the nearby console.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Timescape&quot; - 03/29/93 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My internal chronometer and the<br>
    ship's computer are perfectly<br>
    synchronized. There does not<br>
    appear to be a temporal<br>
    discrepancy.</p>
  <p> A beat. No one has an explanation.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data -- let's run a ship-wide<br>
    diagnostic. Maybe there's<br>
    something we missed...</p>
  <p> Data nods and they move to the cockpit of the Runabout.<br>
    Troi and Picard sit down at the table. (NOTE: The bowl<br>
    of fruit is still on the table.)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's go through it again. You<br>
    were sitting there... and we were<br>
    sitting here...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Describe the exact moment when<br>
    things appeared to freeze.</p>
  <p> Troi thinks.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Geordi was talking about what it<br>
    felt like to touch the plasma<br>
    field... You were lifting the<br>
    cup, about to take a drink...</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Did you sense anything from us<br>
    during that time? Any unusual<br>
    emotions?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No... not a thing. I was<br>
    empathically aware of you, right<br>
    up to the moment you froze, but<br>
    then it all stopped...</p>
  <p> Troi sighs... tries to relax.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Timescape&quot; - 03/29/93 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The past few days have been<br>
    exhausting. Maybe it was my<br>
    imagination...<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    There were moments in that lecture<br>
    hall when I thought time was<br>
    standing still, too...</p>
  <p> Picard smiles.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There is another possibility,<br>
    Counselor. Perhaps this was<br>
    nothing more than a simple --</p>
  <p>6 NEW ANGLE - FROM TROI'S POINT OF VIEW</p>
  <p> IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE, THE ENTIRE SCENE HAS CHANGED.<br>
    Picard, Data and Geordi are now standing closely around<br>
    Troi, looking at her with concern. Geordi is scanning<br>
    her with a medical tricorder.</p>
  <p> Troi is stunned -- it takes her a moment to realize<br>
    what has happened.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you alright?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You have been motionless for three<br>
    minutes, eleven seconds.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Motionless... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It appears to be the same effect<br>
    you described to us.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Can you remember anything?</p>
  <p> Troi thinks, unsettled...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Timescape&quot; - 03/29/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No... one second I was sitting<br>
    here talking with you... the next,<br>
    you were all standing around me.</p>
  <p> Geordi works the tricorder.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    Wait a second... this is weird...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I had the tricorder run a<br>
    comparison between the bio-scan I<br>
    took of you earlier... and the one<br>
    I took just now...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    In the time between the two scans,<br>
    you should have aged twenty-three<br>
    minutes. But according to your<br>
    cellular decay levels... you've<br>
    only aged twenty minutes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    What could account for the<br>
    discrepancy?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't know, sir. It's as if for<br>
    three minutes, time stopped for<br>
    Counselor Troi.</p>
  <p> They consider the situation -- this is getting weird.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data -- contact the<br>
    Enterprise. Tell Commander Riker<br>
    to get to the rendezvous point as<br>
    soon as possible. Have him begin<br>
    scanning the region for temporal<br>
    anomalies.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> Data EXITS into the cockpit.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Timescape&quot; - 03/29/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll take a look at the sensor<br>

  <p> EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE IS COMPLETELY STOPPED, FROZEN<br>
    IN PLACE. The ship is utterly SILENT. The Bridge has<br>

    However, the information currently<br>
    displayed indicates that there was<br>
    a massive power surge in<br>
    Engineering.</p>
  <p> Picard moves to the Tactical position -- studies the<br>

    Security teams had just been sent<br>
    to Transporter Room Three... and<br>
    Sickbay.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to the others.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor -- you go to Sickbay.<br>
    Have a look around. Data, go to<br>
    Main Engineering -- see if you can<br>
    determine the cause of the power<br>
    surge. I'll be in Transporter<br>
    Room Three.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Picard to La Forge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    La Forge here, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lock onto our signals. I want you<br>
    to beam Counselor Troi to --</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    I'd rather not, Captain. We've<br>
    got limited power... and your<br>
    isolation fields consume a lot of<br>
    energy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Understood. We'll use the<br>
    Jefferies Tubes.<br>
    (to others)<br>
    Let's go.</p>
  <p> As they all turn to go...</p>
  <p>33A INT. JEFFERIES TUBE</p>
  <p> Picard, Troi and Data are climbing downward (in that<br>
    order) through the cramped space. On the move:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    T-Sixteen is directly ahead --<br>
    it's the main junction for this<br>
    section of the ship. We should<br>
    have reasonably easy access to our<br>
    destinations from there...</p>

  <p>33A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> They come to the hatch in the platform floor. Picard<br>
    uses a door-opening device (as seen in &quot;Starship Mine&quot;)<br>
    to pry it open.</p>
  <p> He stops, startled to see a FROZEN FACE staring right<br>
    up at him on the other side of the hatch: a CREWMEMBER<br>
    stopped in mid-climb below, an urgent look on his face.<br>
    Two more CREWMEMBERS can be seen behind him, also<br>
    caught in mid-climb. They are carrying several pieces<br>
    of (TECH) equipment, making it impossibly cramped on<br>
    their side of the Tube.</p>
  <p> Picard, Troi and Data eye the frozen crewmembers.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Maybe we can get around them...</p>
  <p> A beat -- it looks unlikely.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. We'll find an alternate<br>
    route.<br>
    (beat)<br>

    apart with android strength...</p>
  <p> Data gets them open and enters the room. He glances<br>
    around, taking in the scene... then sees something in<br>
    the direction of the engine core. He reacts, clearly<br>
    concerned. As he moves toward the core...</p>
  <p>34 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Troi walking down the utterly silent hallway. She<br>
    passes a FROZEN CREWMEMBER who has been caught in midstride.<br>
    She eyes him as she passes... it's a disarming<br>
    sight...</p>

  <p>35 INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Troi arrives at the entrance to Sickbay. TWO SECURITY<br>
    GUARDS are stopped in the open doorway, phasers drawn,<br>
    in the middle of ENTERING the room. Troi carefully<br>
    brushes past them and enters the room...</p>
  <p>36 INT. SICKBAY - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> As Troi ENTERS and looks around. The room has been<br>
    fixed in mid-moment. TWO MEDICAL N.D.S are visible<br>
    frozen in mid-work. They have urgent expressions.<br>
    Troi glances beside her. A frozen ROMULAN WOMAN is<br>
    standing against the wall by the door. Troi walks<br>
    further into the room... surveying the scene... and<br>
    stops at what she sees:</p>
  <p>37 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY is standing a few feet away with her arms<br>
    spread apart, body in mid-jolt, eyes wide with shock.<br>
    A DISRUPTOR BLAST HAS PENETRATED HER CHEST -- THE<br>
    GLOWING BEAM CAUGHT IN MID-FLASH. A nasty-looking HOLE<br>
    has been burned through her chest.</p>
  <p> A ROMULAN MAN stands a few feet away, firing the phaser<br>
    at her. It has all been FROZEN in time.</p>
  <p>38 TROI</p>
  <p> reacts. She takes a step toward Beverly, disturbed by<br>
    the sight. It looks hopeless.</p>
  <p> Finally, Troi turns and heads for the door. As she<br>
    goes, she passes the Romulan who is standing by the<br>
    door...</p>
  <p>39 CLOSE - THE ROMULAN WOMAN</p>
  <p> A beat goes by. Then, inexplicably, the Romulan's eyes<br>
    follow Troi as she exits. She turns toward the door.<br>
    Clearly, she is not frozen in time.</p>
  <p> OFF her unreadable face....</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p>40 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As before. Motionless.</p>
  <p>40A INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard walking along the empty hall. He passes a<br>
    Turbolift whose doors are partially open... and<br>
    something catches his eye. He moves to the doors...<br>
    positions himself to get a good look inside the<br>
    Turbolift...</p>
  <p>40B PICARD'S POV - TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Just visible beyond to the half-closed door, a ROMULAN<br>
    and an N.D. CREWMEMBER are standing side-by-side,<br>
    motionless, apparently caught in mid-conversation.</p>
  <p>40C PICARD</p>
  <p> reacts to the sight, curious... then moves off down the<br>
    corridor...</p>
  <p>41 INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The scene is FROZEN in a tableau. THREE ROMULANS are<br>
    motionless on the Transporter stage. One is holding<br>
    his arm, injured, a look of pain on his face. Another<br>
    is helping him along. The third Romulan is stepping<br>
    down off the Transporter platform, his mouth open in<br>
    mid-speech. TWO SECURITY N.D.S are frozen at the foot<br>
    of the stage, facing the Romulans, phasers drawn.</p>
  <p>42 PICARD</p>
  <p> is moving from person to person, exploring the scene<br>
    for clues. He stops at WORF, who is FROZEN at the<br>
    Transporter console. Picard tries to read the console<br>
    display, but Worf's hands are covering it. Picard<br>
    considers... then gently slides Worf's hands out of the<br>
    way...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Excuse me, Mister Worf...</p>
  <p> Picard examines the console with interest...</p>

  <p>43 TROI</p>
  <p> ENTERS, looking shaken by her recent experience in<br>
    Sickbay. She crosses to Picard.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor. Take a look at this...</p>
  <p> Picard indicates the console.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It appears that Mister Worf had<br>
    just beamed these three aboard...<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Timescape&quot; - REV. 03/30/93 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    (off console)<br>
    According to this, three other<br>
    Romulans were beamed directly to<br>
    Sickbay just seconds before.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I know. I just saw them...</p>
  <p> Troi tries to find a way to tell Picard what she just<br>
    found. But Picard is absorbed in the mystery.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why would we be transporting<br>
    Romulans onto our ship in the<br>
    middle of a battle?</p>
  <p> Picard gestures toward the Transporter stage -- at the<br>
    Romulans standing there... the Security N.D.s with<br>
    their phasers drawn...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (re: Romulans)<br>
    They don't have any weapons... and<br>
    that one looks injured. If they<br>
    were part of an invasion, why are<br>
    they unarmed? It doesn't make<br>
    sense...</p>
  <p> Troi hesitates, trying to find the best way to put<br>
    this. It's a difficult moment.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Captain... there's something I<br>
    have to tell you...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Doctor Crusher has been hit by a<br>
    disruptor blast at point blank<br>
    range... if time returns to<br>
    normal, I don't see how she can<br>
    survive.</p>
  <p> A grim beat as Picard absorbs the news. He heads for<br>
    the door, determined.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard here.</p>
  <p> DATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Please come to Engineering<br>
    immediately. It is urgent.</p>
  <p> Picard and Troi exchange a concerned look. As they<br>
    EXIT...</p>

  <p> Data is studying the Pool Table read-outs. FOUR<br>
    ENGINEERING N.D.S can been seen FROZEN in the room.<br>
    One of them is working frantically; the other is<br>
    running toward the door, a look of concern on his face.</p>
  <p> Picard and Troi ENTER through the opened Jefferies Tube<br>
    entrance and cross to Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's the problem, Mister Data?</p>
  <p> Data turns to them.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe I have discovered the<br>
    cause of the power surge.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    There is a warp core breach in<br>
    progress.</p>
  <p> They react. Data indicates the engine core. They walk<br>
    up to it...</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>45 ANGLE ON ENGINE CORE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A CLOUD OF VIOLENT BLUE-WHITE GAS IS BALLOONING OUTWARD<br>
    FROM THE CORE, FROZEN IN TIME. It is a warp core<br>
    EXPLOSION, stopped at its beginning -- a strange and<br>
    terrifying sight.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Timescape&quot; - REV. 03/30/93 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>45 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (re: explosion)<br>
    It is the flashpoint of a warp<br>
    core explosion.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And it is expanding.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Expanding... I thought time was<br>
    suspended on this ship.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We were incorrect. I have<br>
    determined that time is moving<br>
    forward at an infinitesimal rate.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why didn't we notice it before?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Our initial conclusion was based<br>
    on our observations of the crew.<br>
    A warp core breach moves at a much<br>
    faster rate.</p>
  <p> He indicates the breach cloud.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The motion of the cloud is within<br>
    my visual detection threshold.<br>
    Based on its current expansion<br>
    rate, it will consume the ship in<br>
    approximately nine hours,<br>
    seventeen minutes.</p>
  <p> They react to the news -- troubled.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there any way we can stop it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is no longer a question of<br>
    stopping it, sir. The explosion<br>
    has already occurred -- The fact<br>
    that it is moving slowly changes<br>
    nothing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Timescape&quot; - REV. 03/30/93 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>45 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard stares at the breach cloud for a long moment...<br>
    becoming very thoughtful...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Astonishing... to see it frozen<br>
    like this...</p>
  <p> Picard studies the explosion... moves offscreen as Data<br>
    and Troi continue talking...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Do we know what caused the breach?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No. However, the console displays<br>
    indicate that there was a power<br>
    transfer in progress from the<br>
    Enterprise to the Romulan vessel<br>
    at the moment time decelerated.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    That is why there is a second beam<br>
    between the two ships.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why would we be sending them<br>
    power?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps we should go aboard the<br>
    Romulan ship. The answer to that<br>
    question may --</p>
  <p> From offscreen, Picard LAUGHS. They turn to see --</p>
  <p>46 INCLUDE PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> standing near the breach cloud. He has just TRACED two<br>
    eyes and a mouth in the gaseous cloud -- a big smiling<br>
    face. He studies the result... then looks at Data and<br>
    Troi. He points to the face and starts laughing again.<br>
    Clearly, something is wrong with him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> Picard reacts to a sudden pain in his head, dizzy...<br>
    stumbles backward and leans against the wall. Troi and<br>
    Data rush to him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Timescape&quot; - REV. 04/01/93 - ACT THREE 32.</p>

  <p> Picard looks up at them, serious.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My head... dizzy... I can't...</p>
  <p> And he starts laughing again, uncontrollably. Data<br>
    reaches for him, but Picard pulls away, suddenly<br>
    panicked.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No!</p>
  <p> Picard struggles against Data, losing all control. He<br>
    looks deranged. Troi taps her armband.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    In much the same way that deep sea<br>
    divers can experience nitrogen<br>
    narcosis -- you experienced a form<br>
    of temporal narcosis.</p>
  <p> Picard considers -- it's a disturbing revelation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can we modify the subspace<br>
    isolators to give us better<br>
    protection?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't think so. All we can do<br>
    right now is be careful -- limit<br>
    our exposure to their time frame.<br>
    We probably shouldn't stay any<br>
    longer than ten minutes per trip.<br>
    And we should stick together while<br>
    we're there... just in case.</p>
  <p> Picard nods, stands.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. Our next step is to<br>
    find out why the Enterprise was<br>
    transferring power to the Romulan<br>
    ship.<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    We'll begin our search in their<br>
    engine room. Counselor -- you<br>
    spent several days on a Romulan<br>
    ship -- you know more about their<br>
    lay-outs than anyone here.<br>
    Perhaps you can --</p>
  <p> Picard reacts to a pain in his head, dizzy.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain. It might be better if<br>
    you stayed here this time and gave<br>
    yourself a chance to recover.</p>
  <p> Picard is reluctant, but he knows she's right.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're right...<br>
    (to all)<br>
    I'll monitor your progress from<br>
    here. Ten minutes... no more.</p>

    space in the room. They look around --</p>
  <p>51 NEW ANGLE - THE ROOM</p>
  <p> EVERYTHING IS FROZEN. There are several ROMULAN N.D.S.<br>
    stopped in various activities. There is a sense of<br>
    urgency to their actions -- clearly, something urgent<br>
    was happening when time stopped.</p>
  <p>52 DATA, GEORDI, TROI</p>
  <p> take it all in.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Geordi, there should be a power<br>

  <p> Geordi nods. They quickly move to different consoles<br>

  <p>53 DATA AND TROI</p>
  <p> stop at a console. They study the screen.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    This is highly unusual. The crew<br>
    is not at Battle Stations. The<br>
    ship is on Evacuation Alert.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Is that why Romulans were being<br>
    transported to the Enterprise... ?</p>
  <p> They consider.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Timescape&quot; - REV. 04/01/93 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>54 GEORDI</p>
  <p> moves to a corner of the room and reads a console.<br>
    (NOTE: This corner is empty -- there are no Romulans<br>
    standing nearby). He reacts to the display.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to others)<br>
    Take a look at this...</p>
  <p> Data and Troi move to him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off console)<br>
    There's an energy feedback<br>
    returning through the transfer<br>
    beam. It's probably what<br>
    overloaded the Enterprise's<br>
    engine... and caused the core<br>
    breach.</p>
  <p> They consider.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps the Warbird was trying to<br>
    destroy the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off console)<br>
    I don't think so. According to<br>
    this, the Romulans were trying to<br>
    shut down the power transfer.</p>
  <p> A puzzled beat.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Whatever happened, this is<br>
    beginning to look less and less<br>
    like a Romulan attack...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Let's take a look at their engine<br>
    output.</p>
  <p> They move to a console near the ENGINE CORE... study<br>
    the readings.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console, surprised)<br>
    Geordi -- the engine core is<br>
    completely inactive.</p>

  <p>54 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    That's impossible. The Romulans<br>
    use an artificial quantum<br>
    singularity as their power source.<br>
    Once it's activated, it can't be<br>
    shut down.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe we should take a closer<br>
    look....</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Timescape&quot; - REV. 04/02/93 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>54 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Data nods. They move to the engine core. Geordi<br>
    manually opens a large ACCESS PANEL on the core<br>
    chamber... looks inside... and steps back, a look of<br>
    surprise on his face.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I think we found the problem...</p>
  <p> Geordi moves aside and Data and Troi look inside the<br>
    core.</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>55 ANGLE - ENGINE CORE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The core is filled with an otherworldly KALEIDOSCOPE --<br>
    AS IF SPACE ITSELF HAS BEEN FRAGMENTED, LIKE A<br>
    SHATTERED MIRROR. IT IS CONTINUALLY SHIFTING, MOVING.<br>
    (NOTE: Also visible within the kaleidoscope effect are<br>
    several DARK SPOTS -- which we will later learn are<br>
    ALIEN EGGS.)</p>
  <p> Data pulls out his tricorder and takes a reading of the<br>
    vortex. Throughout the conversation, Data continues to<br>
    scan.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    It appears to be a highly focused<br>
    aperture in the space-time<br>
    continuum. Its energy signature<br>
    matches that of the temporal<br>
    fragments we observed earlier.<br>
    However, it is approximately one<br>
    point two million times as<br>
    intense.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I believe this may be the origin<br>
    of the temporal fragmentation.</p>
  <p> Data continues to scan the core... intrigued...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What are these dark spots?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing, off<br>
    tricorder)<br>
    I am not certain. They exhibit<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    (re: Romulan)<br>

    Mister Data... you said you<br>
    discovered organic matter within<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I want to take a closer look at<br>

    from these dark spots.</p>
  <p> Picard studies the screen.</p>

    Can you isolate one of them and<br>

  <p> Data works. The graphic MAGNIFIES to show one single<br>
    DARK SPOT. Within the spot is a pattern which suggests<br>
    a cluster of CELLS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (off graphic)<br>
    It looks like a cellular<br>
    cluster...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Its bio-electric patterns are<br>
    similar to that of the alien.<br>
    However, it is significantly less<br>

    We thought the Romulan core...<br>
    would suffice... it did not...</p>
  <p> Data realizes, turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain -- I believe his species<br>
    mistook the artificial<br>
    singularity, which the Romulans<br>
    use in their engine, for a natural<br>
    one... a black hole. They tried<br>
    to use it as a nest.</p>
  <p> They piece it together...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's what deactivated the<br>
    Warbird's engine core... so the<br>
    Romulans sent out a distress<br>
    call...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (off that)<br>
    The Enterprise responded... found<br>
    the Warbird suffering an apparent<br>
    engine failure... and attempted a<br>
    power transfer.</p>
  <p> The Romulan seizes onto the words -- speaks with<br>
    emphasis:</p>
  <p> ROMULAN/ALIEN<br>
    Power transfer... we must stop the<br>
    power transfer... it has...<br>
    ruptured time... it will<br>
    destroy... our young...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there a way to lock onto the<br>
    core itself... beam it into space?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, sir. We would need to<br>
    surround the core with a subspace<br>
    isolation field. It is not<br>
    possible to generate a field of<br>
    that magnituide from the Runabout.</p>
  <p> They consider -- it looks hopeless. Picard paces the<br>
    room as an idea starts to form in his mind...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data... when you scanned<br>
    the temporal aperture with your<br>
    tricorder... it caused time to<br>
    move forward, and back again...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What if we found a way to reverse<br>
    that process -- make time move<br>
    backward... then forward.</p>

    We might be able to run time back<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so, Data.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    If this works, we may not have<br>

  <p>94 INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> TIME MOVING FORWARD. We see the following action<br>
    happen quickly:</p>
  <p> The ship is JOLTED. The Conn console EXPLODES,<br>
    knocking the Starfleet N.D. to the ground. A Romulan<br>
    quickly moves in to take control. Riker and the<br>
    Romulan Commander are thrown across Bridge. Riker<br>
    manages to catch him before he crashes into him. (This<br>
    is the moment where time was frozen).</p>
  <p> The action continues without pause. Riker sees Picard<br>
    and reacts to the sight of him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    No time to explain, Number One.<br>
    Continue the evacuation of the<br>
    Romulan ship. You'll find LaForge<br>
    in the Romulan engine room --<br>
    beam him directly to Sickbay.</p>
  <p> Riker moves to a console --</p>

  <p>95 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Troi KNOCKS Beverly aside just as the DISRUPTOR BLAST<br>
    shoots by Beverly and HITS the wall. The Romulan takes<br>
    a step toward Beverly, but Troi immediately aims her<br>
    phaser at him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to Romulan, a threat)<br>
    Step away -- now.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at Troi, confused.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Deanna, it's okay -- he wasn't<br>
    firing at me.</p>
  <p> Troi looks at the Romulan.</p>
  <p> ROMULAN<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    There was an alien here... who'd<br>
    taken Romulan form. I was firing<br>

    The doctor got in the way.</p>

  <p> As before. Picard and Riker, urgent.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Can we move the ship?</p>
  <p> Riker moves to his armchair console.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The feedback from the transfer<br>
    beam would tear us apart.</p>
  <p> Tension -- now what? Picard gets an idea -- rushes to<br>
    Tactical.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Patch me into the navigational<br>

  <p> Riker moves to the Conn, works. The ship SHAKES --<br>
    tension building</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Got it!</p>
  <p> Picard hits a few commands at tactical.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> The Runabout FLIES into the space between the<br>
    Enterprise and the Romulan ship, INTERRUPTING the<br>

  <p> The Romulan Warbird FRACTURES IN A KALEIDOSCOPE EFFECT<br>
    AND COMPLETELY VANISHES.</p>

  <p>99 INT. ENGINEERING - (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data at the console. A few feet away, the unconscious<br>
    Romulan VANISHES IN A KALEIDOSCOPE EFFECT. Data<br>
    reacts.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    The core breach has been<br>
    prevented, sir.</p>
  <p> Data begins scanning the region where the Romulan was<br>
    lying.</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>99A INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard reading tactical.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Data -- it appears that severing<br>
    the power transfer has not only<br>
    prevented the core breach, but has<br>
    also restored space-time to<br>
    normal.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    The alien who attacked me has<br>

    Captain's Log, Stardate 46945.3.<br>
    We successfully evacuated the crew<br>
    of the Romulan ship. We're on<br>
    course to the Neutral Zone to<br>
    bring them home.</p>
  <p>101 INT. ENTERPRISE - DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> A couple of days later. Data is sitting at a table,<br>
    staring intently at a small TEA KETTLE, which is on a<br>
    burner.</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS, glances around, a little nervous.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Where's that cat of yours?</p>
  <p> Data does not look up from the kettle.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Spot is sleeping, sir. Why do you<br>
    ask?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No reason...</p>
  <p> Riker crosses to Data, hands him a PADD.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've worked out the new rotation<br>
    schedules. I'd like you to cross<br>
    check the personnel assignments<br>
    and notify all department heads.<br>

    (beat)<br>
    Your new Bridge shift begins at<br>
    twenty-three hundred hours.</p>
  <p> Data takes the PADD without looking up -- his attention<br>
    remains fixed on the kettle.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Understood, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker eyes him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Timescape&quot; - REV. 04/02/93 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>101 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data watches the kettle. A beat goes by. Then the<br>
    kettle begins to WHISTLE. Data looks thoughtful.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, what are you doing?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Recent events have compelled me to<br>
    study how humans perceive the<br>
    passage of time.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    For example, I have often heard<br>
    people comment that time seems to<br>
    pass more &quot;slowly&quot; in one<br>
    instance, or more &quot;quickly&quot; in<br>
    another. Yet in reality, the<br>
    actual passage of time remains<br>
    fixed.</p>
  <p> Riker considers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I guess everybody perceives time<br>
    a little differently... it depends<br>
    on the exact situation... how<br>
    you're feeling...</p>
  <p> Data indicates the kettle.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have been testing the aphorism<br>
    that &quot;a watched pot never boils&quot;.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I have boiled the same amount of<br>
    water in this kettle sixty-two<br>
    times. In some cases, I ignored<br>
    the kettle.<br>

    In others, I watched it intently.<br>
    In every instance, the water<br>
    reached its boiling point in<br>
    precisely fifty-one point seven<br>
    seconds.</p>
  <p> They stare at the kettle a moment.</p>

  <p>101 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It would appear that I am not<br>
    capable of perceiving time any<br>
    differently than my internal<br>
    chronometer.</p>
  <p> Riker thinks.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why don't you turn it off?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data... people don't have internal<br>
    chronometers. See what happens<br>
    when you turn yours off.</p>
  <p> Data looks intrigued.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you, Commander. I will try<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> Riker smiles.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Just don't be late for your shift.</p>
  <p> Riker gives Data a smile, and EXITS. Data watches him<br>
    a moment. Suddenly, we hear the kettle WHISTLE. Data<br>
    turns quickly at the sound. OFF his intrigued<br>
    expression as he watches the pot...</p>
