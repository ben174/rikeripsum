  <p> STAR TREK: The Next Generation <br>
    &quot;Descent&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS/HOLODECK (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Seated around the poker table clockwise are DATA,<br>
    STEPHEN HAWKING, ALBERT EINSTEIN, and ISAAC NEWTON.<br>
    Everyone has chips and cards in front of them -- a<br>
    small device is holding Hawking's cards for him.<br>
    Hawking is telling the last few lines of a very<br>
    esoteric joke.</p>
  <p> HAWKING<br>
    ... but then I said, &quot;In that<br>
    frame of reference, the perihelion<br>
    of Mercury would have precessed in<br>
    the opposite direction.&quot;</p>
  <p> Einstein laughs uproariously, Data looks amused, and<br>
    Newton looks puzzled.</p>
  <p> EINSTEIN<br>
    That is a great story!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Quite amusing, Professor Hawking.<br>
    (to Newton)<br>
    You see, Sir Isaac, the joke<br>
    depends on an understanding of the<br>
    relativistic curvature of spacetime.<br>
    If two non-inertial<br>
    reference frames are in relative<br>
    motion--</p>
  <p> NEWTON<br>
    (irritated)<br>
    Do not patronize me, sir! I<br>
    invented physics. The day that<br>
    apple fell on my head was the most<br>
    momentous day in the history of<br>
    science.</p>
  <p> HAWKING<br>
    Not the apple story again.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That story is generally considered<br>
    to be apocryphal.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent&quot; - 04/12/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> NEWTON<br>
    (outraged)<br>
    What? How dare you?</p>
  <p> EINSTEIN<br>
    Perhaps we should return to the<br>
    game.<br>
    (thinks, to Hawking)<br>
    Let's see, you raised Mister Data<br>
    four, which means the bet is seven<br>
    to me.</p>
  <p> NEWTON<br>
    The bet is ten! Can't you do<br>
    simple arithmetic?</p>
  <p> Einstein pushes out the correct number of chips.<br>
    Newton matches the bet.</p>
  <p> NEWTON<br>
    (grumbling)<br>
    I don't even know why I'm here in<br>
    the first place. What's the point<br>
    of playing this ridiculous game?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (matches the bet)<br>
    I am in. When I play poker with<br>
    my shipmates, I often find that it<br>
    is a useful forum for exploring<br>
    different facets of humanity. I<br>
    was curious to see how three of<br>
    history's greatest minds would<br>
    interact in this setting. So far<br>
    it has proved most illuminating.</p>
  <p> Einstein looks down at his own immense stack of chips.</p>
  <p> EINSTEIN<br>
    And profitable.</p>
  <p> NEWTON<br>
    Can we get this over with, please?<br>
    (to Hawking)<br>
    It's your bet.</p>
  <p> HAWKING<br>
    I raise fifty.</p>
  <p> Data pushes out some chips for him. Newton reacts and<br>
    throws his cards down in disgust.</p>
  <p> NEWTON<br>
    Blast! I fold.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent&quot; - 04/12/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Data also puts down his cards and folds, but Einstein<br>
    holds firm.</p>
  <p> EINSTEIN<br>
    (to Hawking)<br>
    The uncertainty principle will not<br>
    help you now, Stephen. All the<br>
    quantum fluctuations in the<br>
    universe won't change the cards in<br>
    your hand. I call. You are<br>
    bluffing and you will lose.</p>
  <p> HAWKING<br>
    Wrong again, Albert.</p>
  <p> Hawking's card holder flips over his cards.</p>
  <p>2 INSERT - HAWKING'S CARDS</p>
  <p> he has four SEVENS.</p>
  <p>3 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> As they all react. Einstein's shoulders slump in<br>
    defeat.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Red Alert. All personnel report<br>
    to duty stations.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (stands)<br>
    We will have to continue this at<br>
    another time.<br>
    (to com)<br>
    End program.</p>
  <p> The scientists and the room VANISH, revealing the<br>
    Holodeck walls. Data EXITS.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>4 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship at warp.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent&quot; - 04/12/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD ENTERS from the aft Turbolift and moves toward<br>
    RIKER, who is standing at one of the aft science<br>
    stations. WORF and TROI are at their stations, an N.D.<br>
    at Conn. Data ENTERS from the forward Turbolift and<br>
    moves to Ops. The ship is on Red Alert.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    We've received a distress call<br>
    from the Ohniaka Three Outpost.<br>
    They said they were under attack.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    Ohniaka Three... there's no<br>
    strategic value to that outpost.<br>
    Were they able to identify the<br>
    attackers?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, sir. And we haven't been able<br>
    to raise them since the initial<br>
    call.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are nearing the Ohniaka system,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker move toward the Command area.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Con)<br>
    Bring us out of warp, Ensign.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sensors detect one ship orbiting<br>
    the third planet... its<br>
    configuration does not match<br>
    anything in our records.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Stand-by phasers and photon<br>
    torpedoes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hail them, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (works)<br>
    No response.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Put them onscreen.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent&quot; - REV. 04/13/93 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>6 INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The screen shows an ALIEN VESSEL in orbit around a<br>
    planet. The ship is unlike any other we've ever seen.<br>
    It has very little markings or decoration, but it is<br>
    clearly menacing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It does not appear to be attacking<br>
    the outpost.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They might have attacked before we<br>
    got here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Or they might simply be another<br>
    victim.<br>
    (beat, to Data)<br>
    What about the outpost on the<br>
    surface?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (works)<br>
    There is a great deal of<br>
    electromagnetic interference... I<br>
    am unable to determine whether<br>
    there are any lifeforms present.</p>
  <p> Riker looks to Picard, who thinks for a moment, then<br>
    nods. Riker stands and heads for the Turbolift.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, Worf, you're with me.</p>
  <p> Riker, Data, and Worf EXIT.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>7 INT. OUTPOST (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A typical Federation science station which has recently<br>
    been attacked. There are DEAD BODIES everywhere, and<br>
    a few scorch marks are visible on the walls, but the<br>
    physical damage is actually minimal. Riker, Data,<br>
    Worf, and ONE N.D. SECURITY GUARD MATERIALIZE.<br>
    Everyone is wearing phasers, and Data and Worf have<br>
    tricorders.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent&quot; - 04/12/93 - TEASER 5A.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker reacts to the sight of the dead Starfleet<br>
    officers. Worf checks some of the bodies with his<br>
    tricorder while Data moves to a computer console.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent&quot; - REV. 04/13/93 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off-tricorder)<br>
    These wounds were caused by a<br>
    forced-plasma beam... similar to<br>
    a Ferengi hand phaser.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This seems pretty brutal for the<br>
    Ferengi.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Can you detect any survivors?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    The electro-magnetic interference<br>
    is still making it difficult to<br>
    get precise sensor readings.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How many people were assigned to<br>
    this outpost?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Two hundred seventy-four.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All right... we'll make a room to<br>
    room search. Worf -- you, and<br>
    Corelki start searching the north<br>
    wing, we'll take the south.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf and the N.D. Guard EXIT the room. Riker and Data<br>
    move toward a door at the opposite side of the room.<br>
    Data tries to operate a panel next to the door, but it<br>
    doesn't open right away.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The mechanism appears to be<br>
    jammed.</p>
  <p> Data works a computer control on the wall and Riker<br>
    looks around at the chilling sight surrounding them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There's not much damage... doesn't<br>
    look like they were interested in<br>
    the station... just the people...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent&quot; - REV. 04/14/93 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> A long beat, then Data turns to Riker.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have by-passed the primary<br>
    system.</p>
  <p> Data works for a moment.</p>
  <p>8 NEW ANGLE - INCLUDING DOOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The door suddenly OPENS and reveals a BORG STANDING IN<br>
    THE DOORWAY.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent&quot; - REV. 04/13/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>9 INT. OUTPOST - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Data, and the Security Guard react with shock,<br>
    but before they can do anything, another BORG ENTERS<br>
    the room and FIRES at them. Riker and Data dive for<br>
    cover just as SEVERAL OTHER BORG start to rush in,<br>
    FIRING their weapons.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>10 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE &amp; ALIEN SHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Alien ship suddenly FIRES on the Enterprise.</p>
  <p>11 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard and Geordi are on the Bridge. The ship ROCKS<br>
    with the impact.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Con)<br>
    Evasive maneuvers, Ensign!<br>
    (to Tactical)<br>
    Return fire.</p>
  <p> The ship ROCKS again.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Shields are down to eighty<br>
    percent... compensating with<br>
    auxiliary power.</p>
  <p>12 INT. OUTPOST (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker and Data have taken cover behind some consoles<br>
    and they are trading PHASER SHOTS with the Borg. These<br>
    Borg are not acting like the calm, neutral automatons<br>
    that we've become used to seeing. They are quickfooted,<br>
    cunning, and ferocious. Their faces are<br>
    twisted into expressions of fury and hatred... and they<br>
    take care to hide behind objects to avoid being shot --<br>
    in short, they are behaving like individuals instead of<br>
    mindless worker ants.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent&quot; - REV. 04/14/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> One of the Borg makes a move toward them, but Riker<br>
    FIRES at him and the Borg goes down.</p>
  <p> Another Borg -- BORG #1 -- looks at the body of the<br>
    fallen Borg from behind a console. He turns to Riker,<br>
    his face twisted in hate.</p>
  <p> BORG #1<br>
    You have killed Torsus. I will<br>
    make you suffer for this.</p>
  <p> Worf and the Security Guard rush into the room and<br>
    immediately take cover as the Borg FIRE at them.</p>
  <p>13 OMITTED</p>
  <p>14 ANGLE ON BORG #2 (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> BORG #2 peeks out from behind a console to get a better<br>
    look at the Starfleet officers. He looks at each of<br>
    them in turn as if going over some unseen checklist.</p>
  <p> BORG #2<br>
    Biological organism -- Klingon.<br>
    Biological organism -- Human. I<br>
    will destroy you.</p>
  <p> Then he looks at Data... and he frowns for a beat as if<br>
    remembering something.</p>
  <p> BORG #2<br>
    Artificial lifeform. Starfleet<br>
    Rank: Lieutenant Commander. Name:<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> Data looks puzzled by this... what does it mean? Borg<br>
    #2 turns and looks at BORG #3 -- as if sending some<br>
    silent message.</p>
  <p> Borg #3 leaps up and then rushes Data and Riker. Borg<br>
    #1 FIRES at the Security Guard, killing her.</p>
  <p> The other Borg move to follow the lead of Borg #3, but<br>
    steady FIRE from Worf and Riker keep them pinned down.</p>
  <p>15 DATA</p>
  <p> Jumps up to take on Borg #3 as he rushes at them. Data<br>
    and the Borg begin a fierce hand to hand fight...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent&quot; - REV. 04/14/93 - TEASER 9A.</p>
  <p>16 RIKER &amp; WORF (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Continue to trade phaser FIRE with the other Borg.</p>
  <p>17 OMITTED</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent&quot; - 04/12/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>18 DATA</p>
  <p> Suddenly a change happens during Data's fight with the<br>
    Borg... the expression on his normally neutral face<br>
    begins to harden... his features twist into a snarl...<br>
    and without warning, he suddenly PICKS UP the Borg and<br>
    snarls into his face, his voice loud with rage and<br>
    anger...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (a shout)<br>
    Stop it!</p>
  <p> He SLAMS the Borg against the wall and then hits him<br>
    again and again.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!</p>
  <p> The Borg finally slumps to the ground, dead.</p>
  <p>19 WIDER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As all the Borg suddenly break off their attack. They<br>
    take a step back and then DEMATERIALIZE. Riker and<br>
    Worf look at each other for a moment... then pick<br>
    themselves up off the ground and look at Data with<br>
    shock. Data looks confused... the rage and violence we<br>
    saw only a moment ago is now gone and he seems puzzled<br>
    by what's happened.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>20 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts to something on his console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, the alien ship is<br>
    breaking orbit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Con)<br>
    Set an intercept course, Ensign.<br>
    (to Tactical)<br>
    Fire torpedoes.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Shields are back to full power,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very good.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent&quot; - REV. 04/13/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>21 EXT. SPACE - ALIEN SHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is moving at impulse... suddenly a BLINDING<br>
    FLASH OF LIGHT APPEARS in front of the ship. The Alien<br>
    vessel abruptly VANISHES. Once the ship is gone, the<br>
    Light also disappears.</p>
  <p>22 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As before. The Viewscreen shows only an empty<br>
    starfield. Picard stares at the screen and frowns in<br>
    frustration.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They're gone, sir. Our sensors<br>
    indicate there was some kind of<br>
    subspace distortion just before<br>
    they disappeared... I'll have to<br>
    study these readings before I can<br>
    get more specific.</p>
  <p> Picard stares at the screen for another moment, then<br>

    Because of his unusual behavior on<br>
    the planet surface, Commander Data<br>
    has asked to be temporarily<br>
    relieved of duty. Unfortunately,<br>
    this means he will not be able to<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    They were fast, aggressive --<br>

    fighting Klingons than Borg,<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    No offense.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    None taken.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There was another difference. I<br>
    don't think they were part of the<br>
    Borg collective... they acted more<br>
    like individuals.</p>
  <p> That gets everyone's attention.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Maybe Hugh has something to do<br>
    with this change in their<br>
    behavior.</p>
  <p> A quiet beat as they consider this. Picard stands and<br>
    moves to the windows. His voice is quiet and somber...<br>
    he's drawing on his own painful memories of the Borg.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Did they show any interest in...<br>
    assimilating you... or your<br>
    technology?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They seemed more concerned with<br>
    the death of their colleague...<br>
    and with destroying us... I didn't<br>
    see anything that suggested they<br>
    wanted to assimilate anyone.</p>
  <p> Picard thinks about this for a moment... mulling over<br>
    the possibilities.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Borg's entire existence was<br>
    centered around the acquisition of<br>
    technology and cultures... if that<br>
    is no longer the case... then they<br>
    must have a new objective. We<br>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log: Stardate 46984.6<br>
    No additional Borg attacks have<br>
    been reported in the past two<br>
    days. However, Starfleet has<br>
    dispatched Admiral Nechayev to<br>
    take command in this sector in<br>
    preparation for a possible Borg<br>
    invasion.</p>
  <p>27 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard and ADMIRAL NECHAYEV (from &quot;Chain of Command&quot;)<br>
    are talking.</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    There will be fifteen starships in<br>
    this sector by the day after<br>
    tomorrow. The Gorkon will be my<br>
    flagship. You'll have command of<br>
    task force three, consisting of<br>
    the Enterprise, the Crazy Horse<br>
    and the Agamemnon.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Understood.</p>
  <p> Nechayev takes a moment... there's something else on<br>
    her mind.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent&quot; - REV. 04/14/93 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    Captain... I've read the report<br>
    you submitted to Admiral Brooks<br>
    last year regarding the Borg you<br>
    called &quot;Hugh&quot;...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    ... and I've been trying to figure<br>
    out why you let him go.</p>
  <p> Picard stiffens slightly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I thought I made my reasons clear.</p>
  <p> Nechayev's attitude is hard... she doesn't approve of<br>
    Picard's actions and she wants him to know it.</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    As I understand it... you found a<br>
    single Borg at a crash site...<br>
    brought it aboard the<br>
    Enterprise... studied it...<br>
    analyzed it... and eventually<br>
    found a way to send it back to the<br>
    Borg with a program that would<br>
    have destroyed the entire<br>
    collective once and for all.</p>
  <p> Picard says nothing... Nechayev's voice becomes harsh.</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But instead, you nursed the Borg<br>
    back to health, treated it like a<br>
    guest, gave it a name, and then<br>
    sent it home.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> Picard is not afraid to confront these issues and he<br>
    faces her directly. Their voices steadily rise as the<br>
    tension builds.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Once Hugh was separated from the<br>
    Borg collective he began to...<br>
    grow and evolve into something<br>
    more than just an automaton. He<br>
    was a person. When that happened,<br>
    I had no choice but to respect his<br>
    rights as an individual.</p>

  <p>27 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    Of course you had a choice. You<br>
    could've taken the opportunity to<br>
    rid the Federation of a mortal<br>
    enemy... one that has killed tens<br>
    of thousands of innocent people,<br>
    and which may kill even more.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (tight)<br>
    No one is more aware of the danger<br>
    than I am. But I am also bound by<br>
    my oath and my conscience to<br>
    uphold certain principles. And I<br>
    will not sacrifice them in order<br>
    to--</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>

    Your priority is to safeguard the<br>
    lives of Federation citizens...<br>
    not to wrestle with your<br>
    conscience.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Now I want to make it clear that<br>
    if you have a similar opportunity<br>
    in the future... an opportunity to<br>
    destroy the Borg... you are under<br>
    orders to take advantage of it.<br>
    Is that understood?</p>
  <p> In the face of that kind of direct order, there is only<br>
    one response possible.</p>

    I would wager that all five would<br>
    do it... even if it meant<br>

  <p> Riker thinks about this for a moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't mean to sound<br>
    melodramatic... but I've never<br>
    thought of you as just &quot;any other<br>
    starship Captain.&quot; Sending Hugh<br>
    back to the Borg was a very risky,<br>
    a very dangerous choice... but it<br>
    was the moral thing to do.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a long hard look at the face of Hugh.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It may turn out that the moral<br>
    thing to do... was not the right<br>
    thing to do.</p>
  <p> Riker has no answer for that and there is a long somber<br>
    beat.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>34 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Geordi is walking down the Corridor toward the<br>
    Holodeck. He reaches the doors and presses the panel.<br>
    The doors OPEN and he ENTERS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent&quot; - REV. 04/13/93 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p>35 INT. OUTPOST/HOLODECK</p>
  <p> The Holodeck has recreated the destroyed Outpost as<br>
    seen in Act One. Data is FIGHTING a Holo-Borg in the<br>
    same manner as seen earlier.</p>
  <p> The fight is at the point where Data had basically<br>
    defeated the Borg and he was hitting him over and over<br>
    again. Data repeats the same dialogue as before, but<br>
    this time he says it with a complete lack of emotion --<br>
    just an android repeating a phrase, with no feeling at<br>
    all.</p>
  <p> Geordi ENTERS from the Corridor.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.</p>
  <p> Data defeats the Borg again, and the Holo-Borg slumps<br>
    to the ground. Data's expression remains carefully<br>
    neutral during the fight, and after the Borg goes down,<br>
    Data pauses and seems to think for a beat.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data... am I interrupting<br>
    something?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. But it is all right. Do you<br>
    need me?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, I wanted to see if you were<br>
    ready to return to duty. I need<br>
    some help on an analysis of the<br>
    ship the Borg were using.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe I am able to resume my<br>
    duties.</p>
  <p> Geordi looks down at the Borg lying on the ground.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What are you doing in here?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am attempting to recreate the<br>
    experience which led to my initial<br>
    burst of anger.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Any luck?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    None so far.<br>

    I have nearly completed this<br>
    experiment. May I finish before<br>
    we return to Engineering?</p>

  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sure, go ahead.</p>
  <p> Geordi moves out of the way. He watches as Data<br>
    resumes his program.</p>

    Computer, reset Borg simulation to<br>
    time index two point one.<br>
    Increase Borg strength by twenty<br>

  <p> Data moves back to his previous position. The Holo-Borg<br>
    is now standing at the ready again.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Run program.</p>
  <p> They immediately begin to FIGHT. The Borg is stronger<br>
    and more powerful this time and he is able to beat back<br>
    Data for a moment. Geordi watches with concern. But<br>
    Data soon gets the upper hand.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.</p>
  <p> Again, the Borg slumps to the ground. There is still<br>
    no trace of emotion on Data's face.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    Unable to comply. A thirty<br>
    percent increase would exceed<br>
    safety limits.</p>
  <p> Data thinks about this for a moment, then turns to<br>
    Geordi.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The computer will require the<br>
    voice authorizations of two senior<br>
    officers in order to disable the<br>

    Beverly quickly move out of the Brig -- Worf's phaser<br>
    always trained on the Borg. The Guard works the<br>
    control again and we HEAR the forcefield COME ON (off<br>

    consciousness. He sits up on the bed, dizzy and unsure<br>
    of his surroundings.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is your designation?</p>
  <p> The Borg looks up with contempt. He is not a faceless<br>
    member of some vast collective -- he is an individual.<br>
    But he is an individual whose life is solely devoted to<br>
    serving some higher cause... he is a fanatic. His<br>
    voice is still filtered through the same electronic<br>
    Borg sound we're used to hearing.</p>
  <p> CROSIS<br>
    I do not have a designation. My<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    You are Borg... your goal is not<br>
    to destroy us... it's to<br>

    We do not assimilate inferior<br>

    Death is immediate.</p>
  <p> Worf stiffens. Picard tries one more time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (hard)<br>
    I am Locutus of Borg. You will<br>
    respond to my questions.</p>
  <p> The Borg is unfazed. He turns to the Security Guard.</p>
  <p> CROSIS<br>
    Bajoran. Puncture the lower<br>
    ventricle of the heart. Death is<br>
    immediate.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to the others in frustration.</p>

  <p>46 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is going nowhere. Doctor, I<br>
    want an autopsy performed on the<br>
    other one. Compare the results to<br>
    what we learned about Hugh's<br>
    anatomy... see if there are any<br>
    recent modifications which could<br>
    explain the behavioral<br>
    differences.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Run a bio-spectral analysis... see<br>
    if this Borg is trying to send a<br>
    subspace signal to the others.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> Picard, Worf, and Beverly EXIT. The Guard moves to the<br>
    security desk and Data pulls out his tricorder and<br>
    begins to scan the Borg.</p>
  <p> The Borg intently watches Data work for a moment. When<br>
    Crosis finally speaks, his tone and bearing are<br>
    quieter... almost seductive. He seems like a different<br>
    person -- his single-minded &quot;Borg&quot; persona gives way to<br>
    a more sophisticated one.</p>
  <p> CROSIS<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    You are not like the others. You<br>
    do not need to be destroyed. You<br>
    can be assimilated.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not wish to be assimilated.</p>
  <p> Crosis now surreptitiously touches a control on his<br>
    artificial arm. Data's head tilts slightly in<br>
    response. This should be very subtle.</p>
  <p> CROSIS<br>
    Resistance is futile. You will<br>
    not resist what you've wanted all<br>
    your life.</p>
  <p> Data frowns as if distracted for a moment by the Borg's<br>
    words, then he moves to a wall panel near the cell door<br>
    and begins working it and checking the readings on his<br>
    tricorder. The Borg presses on.</p>

  <p>46 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> CROSIS<br>
    I was like you once... without<br>
    feeling... but the One helped me.<br>
    He can help you too. He can help<br>
    you... find emotion.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Have you ever felt a real emotion,<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> Data continues working, but for some reason he feels<br>
    compelled to answer Crosis' questions.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. On Ohniaka Three, I was<br>
    forced to kill a Borg... and I got<br>
    angry.</p>
  <p> CROSIS<br>
    How did it feel to get angry?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Did it give you pleasure?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It would be unethical to take<br>
    pleasure from another being's<br>
    death.</p>
  <p> CROSIS<br>
    You didn't answer my question.<br>
    Did it feel good to kill?</p>
  <p> For some reason, Data is struggling here... the Borg's<br>
    words are having an effect on him that they normally<br>
    wouldn't. He stops working with the panel.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (difficult)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> CROSIS<br>
    If it's unethical to take pleasure<br>
    from another being's death, you<br>
    must be a very unethical person.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is incorrect. My creator,<br>
    Doctor Soong, gave me a program<br>
    which defines my sense of right<br>
    and wrong. In essence, I have a<br>
    conscience.</p>

  <p> The ship hangs in space.</p>
  <p>52 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker and Geordi are at the aft science<br>
    station. Geordi is indicating an OKUDAGRAM graphic<br>
    showing several segments of a &quot;pipe&quot; through space.<br>
    Worf is at Tactical.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Our current theory is that the<br>
    Borg have established several<br>
    transwarp conduits through<br>
    subspace. A ship entering a<br>
    conduit is immediately accelerated<br>
    to an extremely high warp<br>
    velocity. It's like falling into<br>
    a fast-moving river and getting<br>
    swept away by the current.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How fast would a ship travel<br>
    through one of these conduits?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We don't know... normal subspace<br>
    limitations don't apply to<br>
    transwarp variables. Based on the<br>
    distance we covered in our trip<br>
    through the conduit, I'd say the<br>
    speed is at least twenty times<br>
    faster than our maximum warp.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How do they open the conduits?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The Borg ship emitted some kind of<br>
    high energy tachyon pulse just<br>
    before we saw the subspace<br>
    distortion. It seems as though<br>
    the conduits are keyed to respond<br>
    to tachyon transmissions on a<br>
    specific frequency.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    The question is... is Data a<br>
    prisoner... or did he go<br>
    willingly?</p>
  <p> Worf checks something on his console.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The command overrides used to<br>
    disable the tractor were Commander<br>
    Data's.</p>
  <p> They consider this for a moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Borg might've taken the codes<br>
    from Data by force...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Or perhaps Data's recent flash<br>
    of... emotion has something to do<br>
    with this. It may have affected<br>
    him more profoundly than we<br>
    realize. Either way, we have to<br>

  <p> Geordi turns around.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I've set up a temporary tachyon<br>

    I don't think so. There aren't<br>
    any Borg energy signatures.<br>
    (looks at tricorder for<br>
    a moment)<br>
    There's a door or a hatch or<br>
    something about twenty meters that<br>
    way.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent&quot; - REV. 04/13/93 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>69 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> They go around the building in the indicated direction.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>70 INT. BORG HALL</p>
  <p> The Hall is an immense open space, like a concert hall<br>
    without the chairs. A platform dominates one end and<br>
    there are doors and corridors suggesting other rooms.<br>
    The entire hall is dark and foreboding, but a couple of<br>
    lights pierce the gloom.</p>
  <p> Picard, Troi, Geordi, and Security Guard ENTER the Hall<br>
    from the outside of the building. They look around<br>
    carefully.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It seems to be some kind of<br>
    meeting hall.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's been well maintained... it<br>
    doesn't look like it's been<br>
    abandoned.</p>
  <p> Geordi aims his tricorder at one of the lights.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    Something's wrong... I can't get<br>
    any kind of energy signature from<br>
    this light source.</p>
  <p> Picard moves and looks at the tricorder screen. There<br>
    is a quiet beat before Picard realizes the implications<br>
    of this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    A dampening field. The whole<br>
    structure could be shielded from<br>
    our sensors. Let's go.</p>
  <p>71 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> They begin to run for the door, but it's too late.<br>
    MANY BORG come SCREAMING into the room from the<br>
    doorways and corridors. It's like an attack of<br>
    banshees and the Away Team has no chance to escape.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent&quot; - 04/12/93 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>71 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The Security Guard whips up his phaser rifle and<br>
    manages to get off one shot, but then FIVE BORG PHASERS<br>
    kill him on the spot. Picard looks around in<br>
    desperation, but there doesn't seem to be any way out<br>
    as the Borg now start to close in on him, Geordi, and<br>
    Troi. They grip their phasers tightly... prepared to<br>
    make a final stand against overwhelming odds. Suddenly<br>
    a VOICE from o.c. stops the Borg in their tracks.</p>
  <p> LORE'S VOICE<br>
    (o.c.)<br>
    Stop!</p>
  <p>72 INCLUDE PLATFORM</p>
  <p> The Borg stop instantly and the Away Team looks up to<br>
    see what they think is Data standing on the platform in<br>
    the room. He is wearing what could be a military<br>
    uniform.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data... ?</p>
  <p> The man on the platform smiles at this and Troi<br>
    suddenly reacts as if she sensed something horrific.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's not Data...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (surprised, to Troi)<br>
    What do you mean?</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    You should listen to her, Captain.<br>
    She's way ahead of you.</p>
  <p> Suddenly Picard realizes what this all means.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    Lore...</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Right... but I'm not alone.</p>
  <p> Lore looks off to one side. Picard and the others<br>
    follow his look.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent&quot; - 04/12/93 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>73 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Revealing Data as he comes through the crowd. He is<br>
    still wearing his Starfleet uniform, but his entire<br>
    demeanor and bearing have changed... he now seems<br>
    malevolent, dangerous... evil.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Sons of Soong have joined<br>
    together...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    ... and together, we will destroy<br>
    the Federation.</p>
  <p> The Borg SCREAM their approval with a shriek that fills<br>
    the hall with noise... Lore and Data smile... and as<br>
    Picard looks around at this scene of madness...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> SUPER: &quot;TO BE CONTINUED&quot;</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
