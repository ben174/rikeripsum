  <p>4 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY</p>
  <p> Picard is in a chair. A Cardassian MED TECH checks a<br>
    PADD which increases or decreases the amount of neural<br>
    chemicals administered. Gul Madred sits behind his<br>
    desk, checks his PADD during Picard's responses.</p>
  <p> Picard looks straight ahead and speaks with a stream of<br>
    consciousness detachment. He is clearly under the<br>
    influence of a chemical substance.</p>

  <p> Madred glances over at the Medical Officer.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    He's ready. Keep the serum at<br>
    that level.</p>
  <p> The Officer nods, and Madred turns back to Picard.</p>

  <p> Gul Madred moves close to Picard studying his face.<br>
    He's uncertain whether Picard really doesn't know, or<br>
    if he is able to hold something back.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE &amp; CARDASSIAN SHIP<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The two ships facing each other in space.</p>
  <p> JELLICO (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log: Stardate 46360.8<br>
    The negotiations with the<br>
    Cardassians have made little<br>
    progress. Gul Lemec continues to<br>
    insist on a complete Federation<br>
    withdrawal from the border and I<br>
    continue to refuse. I believe a<br>
    military confrontation may be<br>
    unavoidable.</p>
  <p>6 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> JELLICO, RIKER, and TROI are seated at the table,<br>
    wearily listening to GUL LEMEC, who is pacing the room<br>
    and droning on and on. GLIN CORAK and GLIN TAJOR are<br>
    also seated.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Gul Lemec, I assure you that what<br>
    the Federation wants, above all,<br>
    is the preservation of peace.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    Ah... peace. Of course. Then how<br>
    do you explain the fact that a<br>
    Federation team launched an<br>
    unprovoked attack on Cardassian<br>
    territory less than fourteen hours<br>
    ago?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. II&quot; - REV. 10/19/92 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker and Troi look surprised. Jellico keeps his<br>
    expression neutral.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I don't know what you're talking<br>
    about.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    Then let me explain. Captain Jean-Luc<br>
    Picard, Lieutenant Worf, and<br>
    Doctor Beverly Crusher landed on<br>
    Celtris Three, attacked one of our<br>
    outposts in a brutal assault, and<br>
    killed over fifty-five men, women<br>
    and children.</p>
  <p> Jellico takes a beat before responding.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    What evidence do you have of that?</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    We have all the evidence we<br>
    need... we have Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is he alive?</p>
  <p> Lemec lets that hang in the air for a moment, then<br>
    pointedly does not answer the question.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    The Cardassian Union has not yet<br>
    decided how to respond to this<br>
    latest provocation.<br>
    (beat, then ominous)<br>
    But rest assured that we will<br>
    respond.</p>
  <p> He holds Jellico's eyes for a beat, then Lemec EXITS,<br>
    followed by Corak and Tajor. Once they're out the<br>
    door, Jellico sits back in his chair... clearly this is<br>
    trouble. Riker and Troi look to him for answers.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain of Command, Pt. II&quot; - 10/15/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is there any truth to what he's<br>
    saying?</p>
  <p> Jellico considers for a moment before answering and<br>
    then is very deliberate and careful as he answers<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Captain Picard and the others were<br>
    sent to... investigate reports of<br>
    a metagenic weapon on Celtris<br>
    Three. It's possible they may<br>
    have been captured.</p>
  <p> Riker and Troi absorb this news.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    But if they escaped, they'll head<br>
    for the Lyshan system -- the<br>
    Enterprise was supposed to meet<br>
    them there in eight hours.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Wil, I want you to take a<br>
    shuttlecraft and head for the<br>
    rendezvous point. The Enterprise<br>
    will have to remain here until the<br>
    endgame with Gul Lemec is played<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker EXITS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. II&quot; - REV. 10/19/92 - ACT ONE 8A-B. 
  </p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If Captain Picard has been<br>
    captured... the Cardassians will<br>
    not hesitate to use any means<br>
    available to obtain information<br>
    from him... including torture.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I know.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    That's why I want you to contact<br>
    Starfleet Command and inform them<br>
    they should change every security<br>
    code and protocol that Captain<br>
    Picard might have had access to.</p>
  <p> Troi waits for something more... some indication of<br>
    concern for Picard, but none is forthcoming. She and<br>
    Jellico look at each other for a long moment.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    That's all, Deanna.</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Troi EXITS, leaving Jellico alone. Off his troubled<br>
    face...</p>
  <p>7 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A door at the far end of the chamber opens.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. II&quot; - REV. 10/21/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard, blindfolded, is escorted by two Cardassian<br>
    Guards whose footsteps echo in the large chamber. The<br>
    Guards place Picard standing in front of Gul Madred's<br>
    desk. His hands are manacled. He nods to them and<br>
    they EXIT.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Captain Picard...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I demand to see a neutral<br>
    representative... as required by<br>
    the Federation-Cardassian peace<br>
    treaty.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> He removes Picard's blindfold... and Picard reacts<br>
    almost as though in pain as the light hits his dilated<br>
    pupils. Clearly he has been blindfolded for some time.<br>
    He squints and blinks as his eyes gradually adjust.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    We have already sent a message to<br>
    Tohvun Three -- the nearest<br>
    neutral planet. They assure us<br>
    they will dispatch someone<br>
    immediately.</p>
  <p> Gul Madred walks in a circle around Picard, studying<br>
    him carefully. Picard looks tired and worn... the last<br>
    hours have not been pleasant. But he does not appear<br>
    to be under the influence of any drugs.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    I hope you're feeling better now<br>
    that the drugs have worn off.<br>
    (small shrug)<br>
    I dislike using drugs... but it is<br>
    the most efficient means of<br>
    getting information. Unless, of<br>
    course, you were given a neuro-inhibitor...<br>
    enabling you to<br>
    withhold it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can't imagine what information<br>
    I have that would be meaningful to<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> Madred smiles, doesn't reply... glances down at<br>
    Picard's hands.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. II&quot; - REV. 10/22/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Please... let me remove those<br>
    restraints.</p>
  <p> He enters a control on his PADD, then manually unsnaps<br>
    Picard's manacles. Picard involuntarily rubs his<br>
    wrists, which show deep bruises where the manacles have<br>
    cut into them. Madred gestures to a chair, as:</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    I understand that you are a<br>
    student of archaeology. Did you<br>
    know that Cardassia boasts some of<br>
    the most ancient and splendid<br>
    ruins anywhere in the galaxy?</p>
  <p> Picard sits, responds carefully... trying to understand<br>
    Madred's technique, not wanting to fall into a trap...<br>
    but knowing that conversation is the way to find his<br>
    opponent's own weaknesses -- something he knows he must<br>
    do if he is to survive.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know that the burial vaults of<br>
    the First Hebitian civilization<br>
    are said to be magnificent.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. II&quot; - REV. 10/19/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Apparently when they were first<br>
    unearthed, two hundred years ago,<br>
    they were. The burial vaults<br>
    contained unimaginably beautiful<br>
    artifacts made of jevonite -- a<br>
    rare, breathtaking stone. But<br>
    most of those objects are gone.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What happened to them?</p>
  <p> Madred smiles slightly, shrugs.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    What happens to impoverished<br>
    societies... the tombs were<br>
    plundered, priceless treasures<br>
    stolen... a few were preserved in<br>
    museums... but even those were<br>
    eventually sold in order to pay<br>
    for our war efforts.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That war cost you hundreds of<br>
    thousands of lives... depleted<br>
    your food supplies... left your<br>
    population weakened and<br>
    miserable... and yet you risk war<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> Something in Madred's eyes burns slightly at this.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    How easy for you to judge us.<br>
    Federation planets seem to want<br>
    for nothing. But our planet is a<br>
    hardscrabble world... famine is<br>
    still a threat... it's not so easy<br>
    for us.</p>
  <p> Picard glances around.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And yet there seems to be enough<br>
    to maintain a well-outfitted --<br>
    and well fed -- military...</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    It is the military which is the<br>
    hope of the population.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. II&quot; - REV. 10/16/92 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Federation would be happy to<br>
    help you feed your people --<br>
    without the need for warfare.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Charity? I don't think so.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not charity... a cooperative<br>
    effort --</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Let's not waste time arguing about<br>
    issues we can't resolve. Would<br>
    you care to tour the Hebitian<br>
    burial vaults?</p>
  <p> Picard stares at him.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Even though they've been stripped<br>
    of funerary regalia, the tomb<br>
    paintings are extraordinary. Any<br>
    student of archaeology would be<br>
    thrilled.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (carefully)<br>
    What I would like... is to be<br>
    returned to my ship.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    My dear Captain... you are a<br>
    criminal. You have been<br>
    apprehended invading one of our<br>
    secret facilities... the least<br>
    that will happen is for you to<br>
    stand trial and be punished.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I am offering you the opportunity<br>
    for that experience to be --<br>
    civilized.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (after a beat)<br>
    And the price for that<br>
    opportunity?</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    (mildly)<br>
    Cooperation.</p>
  <p> He walks away from Picard, musing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. II&quot; - REV. 10/22/92 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (6)</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    We need to know the Federation's<br>
    defense strategy for Minos Korva.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You've injected me with drugs.<br>
    You must know that I have already<br>
    answered truthfully every question<br>
    put to me.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Captain... we have gone to great<br>
    lengths to lure you here --<br>
    because we know that in the event<br>
    of an invasion, the Enterprise<br>
    will be the command ship for the<br>
    sector encompassing Minos Korva.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then it seems you have more<br>
    knowledge about the situation than<br>
    I do.</p>
  <p> Madred stares at him for a beat, then shakes his head<br>
    sadly, taps a command into his console, and the Guards<br>
    ENTER. They pull Picard to his feet... he struggles,<br>
    having no intention of making anything easy for them.<br>
    But they are able to snap the manacles onto his wrists<br>
    again and then secure them to a bar on the ceiling.<br>
    Picard finally stands with arms stretched over his<br>
    head.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. II&quot; - REV. 10/22/92 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (7)</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Wasted energy, Captain... you<br>
    might come to wish you hadn't<br>
    expended it in such a futile<br>
    effort.</p>
  <p> The guards EXIT.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Torture is expressly forbidden by<br>
    the terms of the Seldonis Four<br>
    convention governing treatment of<br>
    prisoners of war.</p>
  <p> Madred lets Picard's empty demand hang there.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Are you in good health? Do you<br>
    have any physical ailments I<br>
    should know about?</p>
  <p> Picard does not respond. Madred takes an object from<br>
    his desk... holds it before Picard's face. It is a<br>
    knife with a jeweled handle.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Beautiful, isn't it? This stone<br>
    is jevonite. You can see why it<br>

  <p> MADRED<br>
    From this point on, you will enjoy<br>
    no privileges of rank... no<br>
    privileges of person. From now<br>
    on, I will refer to you only as<br>
    &quot;human.&quot; You have no other<br>
    identity.</p>
  <p> Madred strips away all of the jumpsuit, leaving Picard<br>
    naked and vulnerable. We see on his upper chest a<br>
    small red scar, suggesting a recent incision.</p>
  <p> Madred walks out of the room, his footsteps echoing.<br>
    The door closes behind him, and we hold on Picard in<br>
    the empty room for a beat.</p>

  <p>8 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard is still in the same position. His head slumps<br>
    onto his chest occasionally as he cannot fight sleep.<br>
    Behind him, the door opens.</p>
  <p>9 ANGLE ON GUL MADRED AND GUARDS</p>
  <p> as they ENTER the room. Madred is carrying the<br>
    Cardassian equivalent of a thermos bottle; the guards,<br>
    a robe. As the guards remove Picard from the bar on<br>
    the ceiling and put the robe on him, Madred opens the<br>
    thermos, pouring himself hot tea.</p>
  <p> GUL MADRED<br>
    Good morning. I trust you slept<br>
    well?</p>
  <p> The guards take Picard to the chair and then EXIT.<br>
    Madred sips his tea matter-of-factly.</p>

  <p>13 PICARD AND MADRED</p>
  <p> Picard watches Madred as he drinks the tea... his own<br>
    mouth is dry and parched. He hasn't had water for a<br>
    long time. Madred is conscious of his need.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    You're thirsty?</p>
  <p> Picard gives a slight nod.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    I would imagine so.</p>
  <p> He caps his thermos and drains his tea.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain of Command, Pt. II&quot; - 10/15/92 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Well. It's time to move on.</p>
  <p> He removes from his desk a PADD. Picard eyes it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have told you what I know.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    I'm sure you have.</p>
  <p> Madred gestures toward the ceiling (or a wall).</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    How many lights do you see there?</p>
  <p> Picard looks in the direction he is pointing.</p>
  <p>13A ON THE LIGHT FIXTURE</p>
  <p> There are four separate lights in the fixture.</p>
  <p>13B RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> Picard turns back to Madred. He's not sure where this<br>
    is going, but he is still alert for any opportunity to<br>
    resist -- and, if possible, land a psychological blow<br>
    on his opponent.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (guarded)<br>
    I see four lights.</p>
  <p> Madred lifts his eyebrows... rises... and walks toward<br>
    the fixture.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Strange... I see five.</p>
  <p> There is a beat as he turns back to Picard.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Are you quite sure?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There are four lights.</p>
  <p> Madred returns to his desk... picks up the PADD, idly<br>
    toying with it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain of Command, Pt. II&quot; - 10/15/92 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>13B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Perhaps you're aware of the<br>
    incision on your chest.</p>
  <p> Picard's eyes drop down... his fingers move<br>
    unconsciously to the small scar.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    While you were under the influence<br>
    of our drugs, you were implanted<br>
    with a small device.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It is a remarkable invention.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    By entering commands in this PADD,<br>
    I can produce pain in any part of<br>
    your body... at various levels of<br>
    severity.</p>
  <p> Madred looks at Picard with genuine apology.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Forgive me... I don't enjoy this,<br>
    but I must demonstrate. It will<br>
    make everything much clearer.</p>
  <p> He looks down at the PADD. Picard steels himself,<br>
    trying to prepare for what is coming. Madred taps a<br>
    command and a wave of pain overtakes Picard. He gasps<br>
    and stiffens... perspiration breaks out... he puts his<br>
    knuckles to his temples and digs them in. Madred taps<br>
    the control off. Picard slumps, gasping, amazed at the<br>
    effect.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Surprising, isn't it? Most people<br>
    feel at first that they can steel<br>
    themselves against it... but they<br>
    are completely unprepared for the<br>
    intensity of the pain.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    That was the lowest possible<br>
    setting.</p>
  <p> Picard draws air in gasps, struggling for composure<br>
    once more.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I... know... nothing... about<br>
    Minos Korva.</p>
  <p> Madred glances at him, surprised.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. II&quot; - REV. 10/16/92 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>13B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    But I've told you that I believe<br>
    you. I didn't ask about Minos<br>
    Korva...</p>
  <p> He gestures idly at the light fixture.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    I asked you... how many lights you<br>
    see there.</p>
  <p> Picard stares at him, realizing that the game has moved<br>
    far beyond the acquisition of information. But he is<br>
    determined to resist... as long as he is able.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There are four lights.</p>
  <p> Madred looks puzzled... glances at the fixtures... back<br>
    at Picard.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    I don't understand how you can be<br>
    so mistaken.</p>
  <p>13C CLOSE ON THE PADD</p>
  <p> as Madred's fingers enter commands. There is a cry of<br>
    pain from Picard.</p>

    the Reklar.</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    First Officer's Log: Supplemental.<br>
    I have returned from the<br>
    rendezvous point in the Lyshan<br>
    system with Doctor Crusher and<br>
    Lieutenant Worf. Captain Picard's<br>
    fate is still unknown.</p>
  <p>15 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> WORF is on a biobed, having his shoulder wound tended<br>
    by an N.D. NURSE. BEVERLY is on another bed, being<br>
    checked over by another NURSE. Jellico and Riker are<br>
    listening to Beverly, who is exhausted and depressed.</p>

  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There was no chance to go back for<br>
    the Captain. We barely made it<br>
    back to the Ferengi cargo ship<br>
    ourselves.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    You were smart not to try.</p>
  <p> That doesn't seem to make Beverly feel any better.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (bitter)<br>
    I don't feel so smart.</p>
  <p> Jellico is sympathetic... he puts a friendly hand on<br>
    her shoulder.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Get some rest, Doctor.<br>

    Wil...</p>
  <p> Jellico and Riker EXIT.</p>
  <p>15A INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Jellico and Riker ENTER from Sickbay and head toward a<br>
    Turbolift.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I want Geordi to analyze the<br>
    readings from Beverly's tricorder.<br>
    Tell him to scrutinize every<br>
    detail of those caverns on Celtris<br>
    Three.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Request permission to begin<br>
    planning a rescue operation.</p>
  <p> Jellico stops and faces Riker.</p>

    him... but we don't even know if<br>
    he's still alive.<br>

  <p>15A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JELLICO (Cont'd)<br>
    Under the circumstances, a rescue<br>
    attempt would be foolhardy.</p>
  <p> Jellico continues down the corridor, but Riker isn't<br>
    content to just let it drop at that.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Shouldn't we assume he is alive<br>
    until we know otherwise? We can't<br>
    just abandon him.</p>
  <p> Jellico stops outside the Turbolift and faces Riker<br>
    squarely.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (hard)<br>
    He's gone. I'm sorry Wil, but<br>
    you're going to have to accept<br>
    that.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I want those tricorder readings<br>
    analyzed by fourteen hundred<br>
    hours.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    Yes, sir.</p>

  <p> Jellico, Riker, and Troi are seated at the table. Gul<br>
    Lemec, Glin Tajor, and Glin Corak are also seated.<br>
    Lemec is holding a Cardassian PADD. He activates the<br>
    PADD and then SLIDES it across the table toward<br>
    Jellico.</p>
  <p>17 ON PADD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> It shows Picard, a prisoner, seated in the Interview<br>
    chair. This is a recording of Picard as seen in the<br>
    Teaser, when he was under the influence of the truth<br>
    inducer.</p>

    Special operations on Celtris<br>
    Three.</p>
  <p>18 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> Jellico turns off the PADD and looks up at Lemec.<br>
    Riker and Troi are troubled by this vision of their<br>
    former captain.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    Do you have anything to say?</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Captain Picard was not acting<br>
    under my orders.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. II&quot; - REV. 10/19/92 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Lemec sits back in his chair and considers Jellico for<br>
    a moment.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    And if we wish to execute him?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Under the terms of the Selonis<br>
    Convention, Captain Picard must --</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    (hard)<br>
    The Selonis Convention applies to<br>
    prisoners of war... which means<br>
    you would have to acknowledge that<br>
    he was captured during a mission<br>
    authorized by the Federation. Do<br>
    you wish to make such an<br>
    admission?</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Riker throws a look at Jellico, but keeps his mouth<br>
    shut.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    Then he will be treated as a<br>
    terrorist.</p>
  <p> Lemec again waits for Jellico's response, but Jellico<br>
    doesn't flinch. He takes the Cardassian PADD and<br>
    SLIDES it back across the table to Lemec.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    That is not my concern.</p>
  <p> Riker and Troi exchange looks, but Jellico never looks<br>
    away from Lemec. Lemec picks up the PADD and then<br>
    continues after a beat.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    There is, of course, an<br>
    alternative.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. II&quot; - REV. 10/19/92 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I'm listening.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    If the Federation agreed to a<br>
    complete and immediate withdrawal<br>
    from this sector... we would be<br>
    disposed to release Captain Picard<br>
    and forget about this...<br>
    incident.</p>
  <p> Jellico seems to consider this for a long beat.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I'll have to discuss this with my<br>
    superiors.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    Of course.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You have seven hours.</p>
  <p> Lemec gestures to Corak and Tajor and they all EXIT.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I'll send a message to Admiral<br>
    Necheyev... recommend that she<br>
    reject Lemec's proposal... and<br>
    deploy more starships along the<br>
    border.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And what about Captain Picard?</p>
  <p> Jellico simply shakes his head. As Riker continues to<br>
    push, both their tempers begin to rise.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. II&quot; - REV. 10/16/92 - ACT TWO 25.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm not suggesting that we trade<br>
    entire star systems for one man's<br>
    life... but we can at least<br>
    acknowledge the fact that he was<br>
    acting under Federation orders...<br>
    that he is a prisoner of war.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It would give him the protections<br>
    of the Seldonis Convention --</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (angry)<br>
    It would play right into Gul<br>
    Lemec's hand. He's just waiting<br>
    for some sign of weakness in our<br>
    position before he starts making<br>
    more demands.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (hot)<br>
    I can't believe you're going to<br>
    sacrifice the Captain's life for<br>
    a negotiating tactic.</p>
  <p> Troi tries to intercede, but the two men are on a<br>
    collision course.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Wil, Captain... I think we're all<br>
    concerned about --</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Are you questioning my judgment,<br>
    Commander?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    As First Officer it's my<br>
    responsibility to point out what<br>
    may be mistakes in the actions of<br>
    the commanding officer. Sir.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Then maybe it's time you found<br>

    Don't make me confine you to<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>

    I have the report on Doctor<br>

  <p> He hands the PADD to Jellico, who glances at it.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Give me the short version.</p>
  <p>STAR TREK: &quot;Chain of Command, Pt. II&quot; - 10/15/92 - ACT THREE28.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Nothing.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Not quite that short.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There's nothing out of the<br>
    ordinary on any of the tricorder<br>
    logs. Just normal scans of the<br>
    caverns on Celtris Three and a few<br>
    tactical scans of armed<br>
    Cardassians.</p>
  <p> Jellico puts down the PADD and moves about the room,<br>
    trying to think.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    They went to a lot of trouble to<br>
    lure a Federation team to that<br>
    planet... why?</p>
  <p> They all think for a moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is possible that the<br>
    Cardassians were interested in<br>
    specifically capturing Captain<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What makes you say that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The metagenic weapon which they<br>
    were supposedly developing used a<br>
    theta-band subspace delivery<br>
    system. Captain Picard is one of<br>
    only three Starfleet Captains with<br>
    extensive experience in testing<br>
    theta-band devices. The other two<br>
    are no longer in Starfleet.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    So they tailored a fake weapon to<br>
    lure Picard. But why? They<br>
    must've known we'd change all his<br>
    access codes and security<br>
    protocols.</p>

  <p>20 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe they're more interested in<br>
    something he did in the past...<br>
    something that happened while he<br>
    was Captain of the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Jellico gets an idea.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Or maybe something that he was<br>
    going to do in the future.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    In case of a Cardassian attack,<br>
    the Enterprise will be assigned as<br>
    the command ship for this sector.<br>
    If the Cardassians got wind of<br>
    that...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They might have assumed Captain<br>
    Picard would know those defense<br>
    plans.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If our theory is correct, it would<br>
    mean the Cardassians are preparing<br>

    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Geordi EXITS.</p>

    regaining what control he can.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your daughter... is lovely...</p>
  <p> Madred turns quickly toward him... he is obviously<br>

  <p> MADRED<br>

  <p> Picard stares at him... the question is sincere... but<br>
    it strikes Picard as bizarre.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    To let a child be exposed to<br>
    this... to someone who is injured<br>
    and suffering... to see that you<br>
    inflict that suffering...</p>

    that enemies deserve their fate.</p>
  <p> He moves idly toward his desk, hands drifting over the<br>
    control for the pain device.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Be careful, Madred. When children<br>
    learn to devalue others... they<br>
    can devalue anyone. Even their<br>
    parents.</p>
  <p> Madred gives him a sharp look.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    To her, I am a hero. I am the<br>
    most powerful man she knows... she<br>
    adores me...</p>
  <p> Picard hears the slight note of desperation in the<br>
    man's voice, seizes on it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Now, perhaps. What will happen<br>
    when she's fifteen? Twenty? Are<br>
    you prepared for the time when she<br>
    might look at you and see you for<br>
    what you are -- and despise you<br>
    for it?</p>

  <p> MADRED<br>

    have. What an arrogant man you<br>
    are.</p>
  <p> He moves closer to Picard, challenging.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    What do you know of Cardassian<br>
    history?</p>
  <p> Picard gives it back with equal intensity.</p>

    And what did peace and<br>

    starved by the millions. Bodies<br>

    rampant. The suffering was<br>
    unimaginable.</p>

    We acquired territory during the<br>

    rebuilding program... we have<br>
    mandated agricultural programs.<br>
    That is what the military has done<br>
    for Cardassia.</p>
  <p> He takes a breath, then leans in toward Picard.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Because of that... my daughter<br>
    will never have to worry about<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Her belly may be full... but her<br>

    indicates one of the monitors.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It looks like there was some minor<br>
    hull degradation along their warp<br>
    nacelles. The distribution<br>
    pattern indicates a recent<br>
    exposure to a molecular dispersion<br>
    field.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Where could they have run into a<br>
    dispersion field?</p>

    They're found in certain types of<br>

  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Isn't there a proto-stellar nebula<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>

    The McAllister C-Five Nebula is<br>
    located just over the border...<br>
    approximately seven light years<br>

  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Could there be Cardassian ships<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's possible... but they couldn't<br>
    stay in there very long. The<br>
    particle flux in the nebula would<br>
    begin to degrade a ship's hull<br>

  <p> Picard walks back to the desk.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What have you done with her?</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Not a thing. She's quite safe.<br>

  <p> Picard stares at him, absorbing this information,<br>
    turning it over in his mind, testing its validity.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    I'm more optimistic about getting<br>
    what we need from the woman.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor Crusher has no information<br>

    You may be right. I'll have to<br>

    I see...</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Unlike you, I had no pleasant<br>
    refuge in my mind... gentle<br>
    memories of family gatherings...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No... I'm sure you didn't.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    How rewarding it must be now to<br>
    repay others for all those years<br>
    of misery.</p>
  <p> Madred looks at him sharply.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    What do you mean?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Torture has never been a reliable<br>
    means of extracting information...<br>
    it is ultimately self-defeating as<br>
    a means of control... and so one<br>
    wonders why it is still practiced.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The only possible reason must<br>
    be... pleasure.</p>
  <p> Madred moves to the desk and picks up the PADD.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    I fail to see where this analysis<br>
    is leading.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Madred, when I look at you now, I<br>
    won't see a powerful Cardassian<br>
    officer... but a small boy weeping<br>
    because he was powerless to<br>
    protect himself.</p>
  <p> Picard is scoring on Madred. He sweeps Picard's food<br>
    off the table.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Be quiet --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (pressing)<br>
    In spite of what you have done to<br>
    me... I find you a pitiable man --</p>

    mouth.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You called me &quot;Picard&quot;...</p>
  <p> And he looks at Madred, knowing he has scored a<br>
    victory. Madred stares at him, face hardening.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    What are the Federation's defense<br>
    plans for Minos Korva?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There are four lights.</p>
  <p> Camera begins to MOVE IN on Madred as he activates the<br>
    PADD; we see him tap the commands, but we don't see<br>
    Picard's physical response.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    There are five lights. How many<br>
    do you see now?</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Each container holds a hundred<br>

    themselves to the hulls of the<br>

  <p> Geordi is working as Jellico ENTERS.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    How are we doing?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Almost done, sir. I've shielded<br>
    the engine nacelles and the<br>
    transporter system so they won't<br>
    be affected by the nebula's<br>
    particle flux.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> Jellico moves to the pilot's chair and sits down. He<br>
    smiles as he looks over some of the controls.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Been awhile since I flew one of<br>
    these... you're a pilot yourself,<br>
    aren't you Geordi?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Began my career as a shuttle pilot --<br>
    on the Jovian Run. Jupiter to<br>
    Saturn and back... once a day,<br>
    every day.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    I was on that run for a while.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (conspiratorially)<br>
    Then you must've done Titan's<br>
    Turn.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Oh, yeah... set a course directly<br>
    for Titan... hold it until you're<br>
    just brushing the atmosphere...<br>
    then throw the helm hard over and<br>
    whip around the moon at point<br>

    And pray like hell nobody saw you.</p>
  <p> They both laugh.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well... this trip into the<br>
    nebula's going to need someone who<br>
    can do Titan's Turn in their<br>
    sleep.<br>
    (indicates panel)<br>
    The mines will have to be laid<br>
    within two kilometers of the<br>
    Cardassian ships. But the<br>
    particle flux from the nebula will<br>
    blind all the sensors except for<br>
    the proximity-detector. You're<br>
    going to need quite a pilot to<br>
    bring that off.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    And is that you?</p>
  <p> Geordi looks at Jellico, knowing the answer is not<br>
    going to please him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No sir, it's not. The man you<br>
    want... is Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> Jellico looks at him, but Geordi doesn't back off.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    He's the best there is.</p>
  <p> Off Jellico's thoughtful reaction...</p>

  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Am I disturbing you?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (cool)<br>
    Not at all.</p>
  <p> Jellico takes a few steps around the room, looking<br>
    around. This is an awkward conversation for both of<br>
    them. Jellico notices the trombone on its stand.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>

    That's right.</p>

  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Ah.</p>
  <p> The moment hangs there, Jellico clearly uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is there something I can do for<br>
    you, Captain?</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Are you aware of our plans to<br>
    attack the Cardassian invasion<br>
    fleet?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir. And I understand you've<br>
    been talking to every shuttle<br>
    pilot on board.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I don't settle for second best.<br>
    In anything.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> There is a long beat as Jellico seems to measure Riker<br>
    for a moment.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Let's drop the ranks for a moment.<br>
    (beat, then blunt)<br>
    I don't like you. I think you're<br>
    insubordinate. Arrogant.<br>
    willful. I don't think you were<br>
    a particularly good first officer.</p>
  <p> Riker doesn't flinch in the face of this bald assault.<br>
    Jellico pauses for a moment, then his voice softens a<br>
    little.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    But... you're also the best pilot<br>
    on the ship.</p>
  <p> Riker takes a moment.</p>

  <p>45B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    As long as the ranks are down,<br>
    Captain, let me say that I don't<br>
    like you, either. You're arrogant<br>
    and closed-minded. You have to<br>
    control everything and everyone.<br>
    You don't provide an atmosphere of<br>
    trust, you don't inspire the crew<br>
    to want to go out of their way for<br>
    you, and you get everybody wound<br>
    up so tight there's no joy in<br>
    anything. I don't think you're a<br>
    particularly good Captain.</p>
  <p> The two men hold a look.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I won't order you to fly this<br>
    mission. I'm here to ask.</p>
  <p> Riker steps right up to Jellico.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> MADRED<br>
    Or you can live in comfort, with<br>
    good food and warm clothing...<br>
    women as you desire them...<br>
    allowed to pursue your studies of<br>
    philosophy and history.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I would enjoy debating with you.<br>
    You have a keen mind.</p>
  <p> He rises, wanders toward Picard.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    It's up to you. A life of ease...<br>
    of reflection and intellectual<br>
    challenge...<br>
    (gesturing around him)<br>
    Or this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What... must I... do... ?</p>
  <p> Madred smiles. His voice is soothing...<br>
    irresistible...</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Nothing, really.<br>
    (gestures upward)<br>
    Tell me how many lights you see.</p>
  <p> There is a heavy silence. Picard slumps in the chair,<br>
    staring up at the lights. In the distance, we hear the<br>
    SOUND of approaching footsteps. An urgency appears in<br>
    Madred's voice.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    How many? How many lights?</p>
  <p> No answer.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    This is your last chance... the<br>
    guards are coming... don't be a<br>
    stubborn fool...</p>
  <p> Picard stares up at the light fixture, eyes glazed, not<br>
    responding.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    (hissing)<br>
    How many?</p>
  <p> The door opens and Gul Lemec ENTERS, accompanied by two<br>
    guards. He surveys the scene.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. II&quot; - REV. 10/16/92 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    You told me he would be ready to<br>
    go.</p>
  <p> Madred has to tear his eyes away from Picard to address<br>
    his superior.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    We had some unfinished business.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    Get him cleaned up. A ship is<br>
    waiting to take him back to the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p>54 ON PICARD</p>
  <p> as he stares at Madred, realizing that everything<br>
    Madred had said was a ruse... one last desperate effort<br>
    to bend Picard to his will.</p>
  <p>55 ON MADRED</p>
  <p> as he returns the look... a complex welter of feelings<br>
    overwhelming him... chagrin that Picard now<br>
    understands... anger at failure... and, in spite of<br>
    himself, the beginnings of respect for Picard's<br>
    extraordinary courage.</p>
  <p>56 ANGLE - THE GROUP</p>
  <p> as Lemec looks from one to the other... curious at the<br>
    potent looks.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    Captain Picard... if you will go<br>
    with the guards, they'll take care<br>
    of you.</p>
  <p> Still holding Madred's look, Picard rises... starts to<br>
    lose his balance but holds on... takes deep breaths of<br>
    air... straightens himself, and walks close to Madred.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There are four lights.</p>
  <p> Madred stares at him briefly, and then, the slightest<br>
    possible nod and smile -- in deference to a man he has<br>
    come to admire.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. II&quot; - REV. 10/16/92 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>56 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard turns and walks out of the room with the guards.<br>
    Madred watches him go. Lemec looks from one to the<br>
    other, feeling the charged atmosphere, but completely<br>
    out of touch with what has transpired.</p>
  <p>56A EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE &amp; CAIRO (STOCK)</p>
  <p> The two ships running side by side.</p>
  <p>56B INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Jellico and Troi (in her regulation uniform) are in<br>
    Command, Worf at Tactical, and Data is now back at Ops<br>
    and in his normal uniform. The doors to the Turbolift<br>
    OPEN and Picard and Riker ENTER.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (stands)<br>
    Captain on the Bridge.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Welcome home, Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (gestures around)<br>
    Just the way you left it. Maybe<br>
    a little better.<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Computer transfer all command<br>
    codes to Captain Jean-Luc Picard.<br>
    Voice authorization: Jellico-alpha-three-one.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Transfer complete. USS Enterprise<br>
    now under command of Captain Jean-Luc<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I relieve you, sir.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I stand relieved.</p>
  <p> Jellico glances around the Bridge one last time.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (to everyone)<br>
    It's been an honor serving with<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. II&quot; - REV. 10/16/92 - ACT FIVE 61A.</p>
  <p>56B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He looks around the Bridge, but there are only cold<br>
    stares from everyone. He nods to Picard and EXITS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You have the Bridge, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard exchanges a look with Troi and then she follows<br>
    him to the Ready Room.</p>
  <p>56C INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard looks around the room for a moment. Everything<br>
    has been returned to the way he had it. He looks<br>
    around at Troi, who is simply waiting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know where to begin,<br>
    Counselor. It was... quite an<br>
    experience.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I read your report.</p>
  <p> Picard nods. There is a quiet beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    One thing I didn't put in my<br>
    report... at the very end, he<br>
    offered me a choice... between a<br>
    life of comfort... or more<br>
    torture... all I had to do was say<br>
    there were five lights.</p>
  <p> Troi regards him for a brief moment.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You didn't say it...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No... but I was going to. I was<br>
    ready to tell him anything he<br>
    wanted... anything at all. But<br>
    more than that, I was beginning to<br>
    believe there were five lights.</p>
  <p> Off her look, acknowledging the enormity of his<br>
    experience...</p>
