  <p> STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION <br>
    &quot;Second Chances&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it orbits a planet whose atmosphere shimmers with a<br>
    strange luminescence.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 46915.2.<br>
    The Enterprise is orbiting Nervala<br>
    Four, waiting for an opportunity<br>
    to retrieve scientific data left<br>
    there by Starfleet researchers<br>
    when they were forced to evacuate<br>
    eight years ago.</p>
  <p>2 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> It is Jazz Night. RIKER is in civilian clothes playing<br>
    the trombone in a quartet. N.D. Supernumeraries sit at<br>
    tables listening and talking quietly among themselves.<br>
    It is a casual setting, with N.D. Waiters moving around<br>
    as the music plays.</p>
  <p> TROI and BEVERLY are sitting together, enjoying the<br>
    music. Riker's quartet finishes a number and they join<br>
    in the applause. Riker bows, gestures to include his<br>
    fellow Band Members.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you... thank you very much.</p>
  <p> As the applause dies down.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Any requests tonight?</p>
  <p> When no one else says anything, Troi gets a mischievous<br>
    look and calls out.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Night Bird.</p>
  <p> Riker pretends he didn't hear her, looks out at the<br>
    crowd.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/19/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Anyone?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (louder)<br>
    Night Bird!</p>
  <p> A few off-screen VOICES murmur their approval -- Riker<br>
    can't ignore her this time and shoots her a &quot;why are<br>
    you doing this to me?&quot; look. Troi just smiles back at<br>
    him as innocently as she can. Riker decides to take<br>
    the challenge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ladies and Gentlemen... Night<br>
    Bird.</p>
  <p> With a look at his fellow musicians, he taps out a<br>
    count and launches into the piece. After a moment.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What was that all about?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (mischievous smile)<br>
    Wil's been trying to get this<br>
    piece right for ten years now.<br>
    He's never made it through the<br>
    solo.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at her, amazed to see her friend in so<br>
    mischievous a mood.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Remember that dance recital I told<br>
    you I was doing?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Next week.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're dis-invited.</p>
  <p> Beverly holds a straight face for a beat before<br>
    smiling. Troi reacts to the music.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Here it comes.</p>
  <p> They both turn to look at Riker. One of the other<br>
    players is doing a solo and Riker is readying himself<br>
    to dive in for his solo. He casts a defiant glance<br>
    over at Troi, then brings his horn to his lips.<br>
    Suddenly...</p>
  <p> DATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Data to Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> Riker stops and with a nod to the others -- who<br>
    improvise and keep playing -- moves away to take the<br>
    com.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (hits combadge)<br>
    Riker, here.</p>
  <p> DATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Commander, you are needed on the<br>
    Bridge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    On my way.</p>
  <p> As he passes Troi and Beverly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Saved by the bell...</p>
  <p> They smile and he moves off.</p>
  <p>3 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> It is the night shift; DATA and various N.D.'s. Riker<br>
    ENTERS from the Turbolift and moves to aft-science<br>
    where Data is working.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You wanted to see me, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. It appears that we will<br>
    be able to transport to the<br>
    surface sooner than we<br>
    anticipated.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker glances at the monitor, where an OKUDAGRAM shows<br>
    a cross-section of the planet and its atmosphere.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is the planet's distortion field<br>
    de-phasing sooner than you<br>
    predicted?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, sir. But using the Potemkin's<br>
    transport logs from the original<br>
    evacuation, Commander La Forge and<br>
    I were able to modify the<br>
    Transporters.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (catching on)<br>
    So we can beam through higher<br>
    distortion levels.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    The Transporters are now<br>
    considerably more efficient than<br>
    those used on the Potemkin eight<br>
    years ago.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Glad to hear it. I almost didn't<br>
    make it off the surface that day.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    When can we get started?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ninety-seven minutes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How long will the transport window<br>
    last?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Twenty-six minutes. After that,<br>
    the distortion field will re-phase.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That doesn't give us much time to<br>
    retrieve the database.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The planet's proximity to its sun<br>
    will create two additional<br>
    transport windows in the next<br>
    three days.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's hope that's enough.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/18/93 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It will have to be. The next<br>
    transport window will not occur<br>
    for another eight years, when the<br>
    planet's orbit brings it close<br>
    enough to the sun to de-phase the<br>
    distortion field.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Notify the Away Team we're going<br>
    in ahead of schedule; I'll tell<br>
    the Captain.</p>
  <p> Data nods and Riker heads for the Turbolift.</p>
  <p>4 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it orbits the planet.</p>
  <p>5 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> GEORDI is doing a last minute check on the Transporter<br>
    system. A transport technician, ENSIGN PALMER is at<br>
    one of the side panels adjacent to the Transporter<br>
    chamber, assisting him. Riker, Data, and WORF ENTER<br>
    with an N.D. technician.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    How long until the transport<br>
    window opens?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Fourteen seconds.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to others)<br>
    Let's get in position.</p>
  <p> Riker leads them up to the Transporter pad.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Whenever you're ready, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p>6 INT. RESEARCH STATION (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the away team MATERIALIZES on the station's<br>
    transporter pad (the pad is not operational -- it is<br>
    merely a convenient place to beam in).</p>
  <p> The station is standard Starfleet issue, with the<br>
    familiar console designs. It is dark, the only light<br>
    coming from the few consoles that are running. Even<br>
    with the low light, we can see that everything is neat<br>
    and orderly. Riker looks around in surprise.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This isn't how I remember it; the<br>
    place was a mess when we left.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander...</p>
  <p> Riker turns and Data gestures toward the ceiling. A<br>
    hole in the station's roof has been repaired with<br>
    pieces of scrap metal, welded into place.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Someone's been here...</p>
  <p> Worf reaches for his phaser, Data for his tricorder.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A vessel could have gotten caught<br>
    in the distortion field and<br>
    crashed. The survivors may have<br>
    taken shelter here.</p>
  <p> Data is scanning with his tricorder.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander, someone is<br>
    approaching... a humanoid. Forty<br>
    meters due east and closing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Riker draws his phaser and gestures that they take<br>
    position behind various consoles. The suspense builds<br>
    as the unknown person approaches; we hear the SOUND of<br>
    footsteps outside the door.</p>
  <p> Suddenly the door swings open and a human figure is<br>
    silhouetted there, though the light from outside<br>
    prevents us from seeing their face.</p>
  <p> The figure steps inside and shuts the door, giving us<br>
    our first look at his face.</p>
  <p> He could be Wil Riker's twin. Shocked, Riker steps out<br>
    from where he is...</p>
  <p>6A ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Both Rikers in frame. The two men look at each other<br>
    in amazement. Off this moment we...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/18/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes) </p>
  <p>7 INT. RESEARCH STATION - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The second Riker looks very much like Commander Riker<br>
    except his beard is a little fuller, his hair a little<br>
    wilder, and his face a little more weathered. He wears<br>
    simple civilian clothes that are slightly soiled here<br>
    and there, as if he's been working in them.</p>
  <p> The other Riker looks warily from Data to Worf to<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Who are you?</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Who are you?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Commander William Riker of the<br>
    Federation Starship Enterprise.</p>
  <p> The other Riker reacts.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    That's not possible. I'm Wil<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> Riker glances at Data and Worf. Data steps forward.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    May I ask how you got here?</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker eyes this strange but seemingly<br>
    sincere man.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Eight years ago, I led a team to<br>
    evacuate this station.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What ship were you on?</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    The Potemkin.</p>
  <p> Riker looks at Data -- how does this man know these<br>
    things?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Why did you not return to the<br>
    Potemkin with the others?</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I was the last one out. The<br>
    distortion field must have<br>
    interfered with the transport;<br>
    they lost their signal lock on me.<br>
    When I tried to contact the ship,<br>
    I couldn't get through the<br>
    interference.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker sees the looks on their faces.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Check with Starfleet; I'm sure<br>
    they recorded me lost that day.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's not what happened. I was<br>
    the last one out... but I made it<br>
    back to the Potemkin.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - ACT ONE 9A.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker reacts to this claim. Their stories<br>
    are clearly incompatible. Data regards them both<br>
    thoughtfully.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    You don't believe me.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's not that we don't believe<br>
    you; it's just hard to see how<br>
    both our stories could be true.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Would you be willing to let our<br>
    Doctor check you out?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lieutenant Worf, take him to<br>
    Sickbay. Notify the Captain as<br>
    soon as you're aboard.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker watches the Klingon as he steps toward<br>
    him. He is clearly surprised to see him in a Starfleet<br>
    uniform. Things have really changed.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (activates combadge)<br>
    Worf to Enterprise. Two to beam<br>
    up.</p>
  <p>8 ON RIKER</p>
  <p> as we hear the SOUND of DEMATERIALIZATION. He doesn't<br>
    know what to make of all this. When his double is<br>
    gone, he casts a glance at Data.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's get to work.</p>
  <p>9 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it orbits the planet.</p>
  <p>10 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> where Beverly is checking out Lieutenant Riker. TWO<br>
    SECURITY GUARDS hang back by the door. He is sitting<br>
    on the table, watching her as she works. As she raises<br>
    her scanner upwards their eyes meet for a moment. This<br>
    is very strange for her -- in a way she feels that she<br>
    knows this man, but of course she doesn't.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/18/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Looks like you fractured your arm<br>
    a few years ago.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I was underneath the station<br>
    making repairs when an earthquake<br>
    hit -- I got caught in a<br>
    rockslide. I had to set it<br>
    myself.</p>
  <p> Beverly nods, realizing how painful this must have<br>
    been. PICARD ENTERS from the corridor. He stops when<br>
    he sees Lieutenant Riker. Although Worf has filled him<br>
    in, nothing could have prepared him for this very<br>
    strange encounter.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain Jean-Luc Picard.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Lieutenant Wil Riker, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard chooses his words carefully.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you are Wil Riker, if there are<br>
    two of you... then something<br>
    extraordinary has occurred. I<br>
    hope you understand our need to<br>
    verify your claim.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Beverly for a report.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Genetically, he's<br>
    indistinguishable from Commander<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> Picard considers for a beat before asking what seems an<br>
    almost impolite question.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Could some sort of cloning be<br>
    involved?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't think so, there's no<br>
    genetic drift.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But that isn't conclusive.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/18/93 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's why I compared their brain<br>
    scans. Brain organization<br>
    patterns are as unique as...<br>
    fingerprints. Except for some<br>
    minor differences, theirs are<br>
    identical.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can't brain patterns be cloned?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No. They're determined by<br>
    experience, mostly in early<br>
    childhood.</p>
  <p> Picard takes this in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How could two men have shared the<br>
    same childhood experiences? It<br>
    doesn't make any sense.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker has been listening quietly, and now<br>
    speaks to Picard with urgency.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Sir, I am Wil Riker. I don't know<br>
    who or what made it back to the<br>
    Potemkin that day, but it wasn't<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (stopping him)<br>
    Lieutenant -- my Chief Engineer is<br>
    checking over the transport logs<br>
    from the Potemkin. They may shed<br>
    some light on what happened.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker backs off.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard tries to be reassuring.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Don't worry, we'll get to the<br>
    bottom of this.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker nods, relieved that at least now his<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    In the meantime you'll be taken to<br>
    quarters. Make yourself<br>
    comfortable.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I will, sir. The replicators on<br>
    the station stopped working a long<br>
    time ago. It's been a while since<br>
    I had a decent meal.</p>
  <p> He flashes a grin so like Commander Riker's that our<br>
    people are struck by it. He hops off the bed and nods<br>
    to Beverly.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Doctor...</p>
  <p> The Security officers and Lieutenant Riker EXIT.<br>
    Picard and Beverly exchange a look. This is all very<br>
    strange to them.</p>
  <p>11 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Geordi is reporting his findings to Picard, Commander<br>
    Riker, Data, Beverly and Troi.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    ... apparently there was a massive<br>
    energy surge in the distortion<br>
    field around the planet just at<br>
    the moment you tried to beam out.<br>
    The Transporter Chief tried to<br>
    compensate by initiating a second<br>
    containment beam.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    An interesting approach. He must<br>
    have been planning to reintegrate<br>
    the two patterns in the transport<br>
    buffer.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Turns out he didn't have to.<br>
    Commander Riker's pattern<br>
    maintained its integrity with just<br>
    the one containment beam -- he<br>
    made it back to the ship just<br>
    fine.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/18/93 - ACT ONE 13A.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What happened to the second beam?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The Transporter Chief shut it<br>
    down, but somehow... it was<br>
    reflected back to the surface.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And another Wil Riker materialized<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How could the second pattern have<br>
    maintained its integrity?</p>
  <p> Geordi's tone indicates he's making his best guess.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The containment beam must have had<br>
    the exact same phase differential<br>
    as the distortion field.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/19/93 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Riker has to know.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Which one of us is... real?</p>
  <p> The answer is clearly important to him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Both. You were both re-materialized<br>
    from a complete<br>
    pattern.</p>
  <p> Riker struggles to assimilate this information.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Up to that moment, you were the<br>
    same person.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But over the last eight years, you<br>
    and...</p>
  <p> Picard searches for a way to differentiate them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    -- Lieutenant Riker have lived<br>
    very different lives. You're<br>
    different people now.</p>
  <p> He addresses the others.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    For us, it's a little like meeting<br>
    a close friend's twin. You can't<br>
    help feeling that you know them...<br>
    but of course you don't.</p>
  <p> Picard ponders the strangeness of it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No matter how strange it may seem<br>
    to us... there are now two Wil<br>
    Rikers aboard this vessel.<br>
    Getting used to the idea may take<br>
    a while... especially for you,<br>
    Wil.</p>
  <p> Riker nods an acknowledgement.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll be all right, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant Riker will be here for<br>
    a few days at least. We should do<br>
    everything we can to make him feel<br>
    comfortable and welcome.</p>
  <p> There is a consensus about this in the room.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That still leaves us with the<br>
    problem of how to retrieve the<br>
    database. The station's computer<br>
    is only partially operational.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Many of its components have been<br>
    removed. Apparently Lieutenant<br>
    Riker used them to keep the<br>
    station's radiation shield<br>
    operational.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can we repair it, at least enough<br>
    to access the database?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Without knowing what he did, it'll<br>
    be tough.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Maybe he could help?</p>
  <p> Picard considers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He was alone down there a long<br>
    time. I'm hesitant to send him<br>
    back until he's been evaluated.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'll talk to him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/19/93 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Riker glances up when she says this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you, Counselor.</p>
  <p> Picard stands and the meeting breaks up.</p>
  <p>12 INT. LIEUTENANT RIKER'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker is cleaned up, now wearing a gold<br>
    Lieutenant's Uniform. He is sitting at a table,<br>
    looking at the screen of a desktop terminal. A now<br>
    empty dinner plate is pushed off to the side. He takes<br>
    a sip from his beverage as he studies the screen.</p>
  <p>13 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> that includes the screen. We see that he is looking<br>
    over Commander Riker's service record, finding out what<br>
    his double has been up to these past eight years.</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES. Lieutenant Riker stands and moves<br>
    toward it.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> The door OPENS to reveal Troi standing there.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker just stares at her for a moment. He<br>
    can't believe it's really her.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Hello, Wil.</p>
  <p> Without hesitation, he moves toward her.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Imzadi...</p>
  <p> Before she can react, he takes her in his arms and<br>
    kisses her... with all the pent-up emotion of a man<br>
    who has been separated too long from the woman he<br>
    loves...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>14 INT. LIEUTENANT RIKER'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> as Troi pulls back from him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Wil...</p>
  <p> He looks at her, his face full of emotion.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I thought I'd never see you<br>
    again...</p>
  <p> She gently pulls back from his embrace.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We need to talk.</p>
  <p> Though her tone is gentle, he realizes something's<br>
    wrong. Suddenly he remembers the situation and it's<br>
    like the wind has been knocked out of him.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    You're here... on this ship...<br>
    because of him.</p>
  <p> He is clearly devastated by the prospect.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> He looks up sharply, needing to know everything.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Commander Riker and I are friends,<br>
    close friends; nothing more.</p>
  <p> He looks at her, no other words could make him happier.<br>
    He moves to take her in his arms again but she stops<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Wil -- why don't we sit down?</p>
  <p> He realizes there's more to this. He gestures to the<br>
    couch and chair and they move toward it and sit.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Do you remember the last time we<br>
    saw each other?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/19/93 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Like yesterday. We spent the day<br>
    at the Janaran falls, on Betazed.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It was the day before you started<br>
    your tour on the Potemkin.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    We were going to meet six weeks<br>
    later, on Risa.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We never did.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    (laughs)<br>
    I know.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What I mean is... Commander Riker<br>
    and I never did.</p>
  <p> He looks at her, beginning to understand what she's<br>
    getting at.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You see... he earned a promotion<br>
    very quickly.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I know.<br>
    (with irony)<br>
    For exceptional valor during the<br>
    evacuation of the research station<br>
    on Nervala Four.<br>
    (off her reaction)<br>
    I looked over his service record.</p>
  <p> Troi acknowledges.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He chose to make his career a<br>
    priority. There wasn't time for<br>
    much of anything else.</p>
  <p> Though her tone is even, in truth, these aren't easy<br>
    memories for her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We kept in touch... but we didn't<br>
    see each other again until we were<br>
    both posted to the Enterprise two<br>
    years later.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker is surprised to hear this.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    By then, our feelings for each<br>
    other had changed. We've served<br>
    together for six years now...<br>
    things never went back to the way<br>
    they used to be.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker takes this in. After a moment.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I had a lot of time on my hands<br>
    down there. There were days I<br>
    felt so alone I thought I might<br>
    lose my mind.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/19/93 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> He looks at her.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Do you know what got me through?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Thinking that if I could hang on,<br>
    one more day, maybe I'd be<br>
    rescued... and I'd see you again.</p>
  <p> The depth of his emotion is almost overwhelming to her.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Well... I guess things don't<br>
    always turn out quite the way you<br>
    expect them to.</p>
  <p> His disappointment is obvious.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I know this isn't what you were<br>
    hoping for, but that doesn't mean<br>
    you can't make a future for<br>
    yourself.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    For now, I think I'll just take<br>
    things one day at a time.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain Picard wanted me to find<br>
    out if you'd be willing to help us<br>
    retrieve the station's database.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I reconfigured that computer<br>
    system so many times they probably<br>
    can't make heads or tails of it.<br>
    I'd be happy to help.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Do you feel up to it?</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Absolutely.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'll tell the Captain.</p>
  <p> She smiles and stands.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Well... I have to go.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> He's disappointed she's leaving, nods an<br>
    acknowledgement. She moves toward the door -- it looks<br>
    like he's going to let her leave without another word<br>
    when suddenly he stands and moves toward her.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Deanna... I know it's been a long<br>
    time since we were together; I<br>
    know your feelings have changed.<br>
    But...</p>
  <p> He almost doesn't continue, the emotions are too raw.<br>
    But he decides to lay it on the line.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Mine haven't. I can't just give<br>
    up and accept that it's over... I<br>
    want to be with you again.</p>
  <p> His feelings are so overwhelming that she doesn't know<br>
    how to respond.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (gently)<br>
    Good night, Wil...</p>
  <p> Their eyes meet for a moment... then she turns and<br>
    EXITS. Off his face as she leaves...</p>
  <p>15 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it orbits the planet.</p>
  <p>16 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Data, Worf and an N.D. technician are getting<br>
    ready to go, doing a final check on the equipment<br>
    they're bringing down in carrying cases. Geordi is at<br>
    working at one of the side panels adjacent to the<br>
    Transporter chamber; Ensign Palmer is at the main<br>
    console.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PALMER<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Phase distortion is dropping --<br>
    the second transport window will<br>
    open in forty-two seconds.</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf exchange a look -- Lieutenant Riker is<br>
    supposed to be here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How long will we have?</p>
  <p> PALMER<br>
    Thirty-six minutes, sir.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are losing time. Lieutenant<br>
    Riker should be here.</p>
  <p> Riker knows he's right, reaches to activate a control<br>
    on the Transporter console.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Computer, where is Lieutenant --</p>
  <p> The door OPENS and Lieutenant Riker hurries in.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Cancel inquiry.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker clearly knows he's late.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You were supposed to report here<br>
    at eight hundred hours.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I'm sorry, I was --</p>
  <p> But Riker interrupts:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    I guess it's been a while since<br>
    you had to punch a clock.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker is surprised by Riker's relatively<br>
    easy going attitude.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to others)<br>
    Let's go.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/18/93 - ACT ONE 23.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Riker moves to the Transporter pad and everyone else<br>
    follows. Geordi joins Palmer at the main console.<br>
    When the Away Team is in position:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p>17 INT. RESEARCH STATION (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the Away Team MATERIALIZES. Most of the station's<br>
    consoles are still down, but the lights are now on.<br>
    The N.D. technician sets about her task. Lieutenant<br>
    Riker moves toward the lit center console.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I shut down most of the consoles<br>
    to save power. I re-routed just<br>
    about everything through here.</p>
  <p> He gets to work.</p>
  <p>18 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Riker, Worf and Data.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Check out the primary EPS<br>
    coupling, see if you can get some<br>
    power to the rest of these<br>
    consoles.</p>
  <p> Data and Worf EXIT to another part of the station.<br>
    Riker crosses to a lit wall console and begins to work.<br>
    This is the first time the two men have been alone<br>
    since they first met, but the awkwardness of it is<br>
    somewhat mitigated by the fact that they have a job to<br>
    do.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    (as he works)<br>
    I shunted the database to the main<br>
    core underneath the station.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Can we access it from here?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/18/93 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    There's been a lot of seismic<br>
    activity over the years; if the<br>
    servo-links were damaged, we may<br>
    not be able to.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker crouches down and opens a panel<br>
    underneath the console.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I'll try to tap into the command<br>
    pathways. See if you can disable<br>
    the file server.</p>
  <p> They both set to work, getting various tools from the<br>
    cases they each brought down. After a few moments,<br>
    Riker casts a glance over at Lieutenant Riker, as if to<br>
    say something. Lieutenant Riker is on his back<br>
    underneath the console, his face hidden from view.<br>
    Riker considers for a beat before going ahead.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I was thinking... we should<br>
    probably let Dad know what's<br>
    happened.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    (wry)<br>
    I'm sure he'll be thrilled to hear<br>
    there are two of us now.</p>
  <p> Riker hears the same ambivalence he felt about his<br>
    father just a few years ago.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't know. He and I patched up<br>
    a few things.</p>
  <p>19 ANGLE - LIEUTENANT RIKER</p>
  <p> as he reacts to this news.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I've gotten by without talking to<br>
    him for a long time. I'm not<br>
    about to start now.</p>
  <p> Riker backs off from the subject. They work in silence<br>
    for a moment.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    What made you contact him?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/19/93 - ACT TWO 25.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I didn't. He came to the<br>
    Enterprise to brief me when I was<br>
    offered the Aries.</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    What did he say when you turned<br>
    down the chance to command your<br>
    own ship?</p>
  <p>19A ANGLE - RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> There's a tone in Lieutenant Riker's voice that Riker<br>
    isn't sure he likes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He couldn't understand why I did<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    For once he and I agree on<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts to this, but before he can reply Data and<br>
    Worf ENTER from the other room.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The primary EPS coupling is fused.<br>
    It will have to be replaced.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    (standing)<br>
    I've accessed the command<br>
    pathways.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's see if that does the trick.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker works his console. Data moves to his<br>
    side. Lieutenant Riker reacts to something on the<br>
    monitor.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    It's not working. The servo-link<br>
    must be damaged. We're going to<br>
    have to go under the station and<br>
    access the core directly.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We have less than three minutes<br>

  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Leave me here. If I start now,<br>
    I'll be finished by the time the<br>
    third window opens.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's too dangerous. Our scans<br>
    show the caverns are unstable.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I've been down there dozens of<br>
    times; I know my way around.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    You go ahead; I'll be finished by<br>

    I gave you an order, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker is startled by Riker's vehemence.<br>
    From his perspective, it's come out of nowhere. The<br>
    two Rikers square off, eye to eye.</p>
  <p> Though it is clear that Lieutenant Riker intends to do<br>
    as he's told, we can see the resentment in his eyes.<br>
    Off this moment we...</p>

  <p> ACT THREE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>20 INT. TROI'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> as she ENTERS, coming home from duty. She crosses<br>
    toward the replicator.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to replicator)<br>
    Computer -- valerian root tea,<br>
    hot.</p>
  <p> We HEAR a cup of tea materialize. She takes the cup<br>
    and crosses toward the bathroom area. As she passes<br>
    her bed, she notices something on her pillow. She<br>
    moves to see what it is... it's a small piece of paper<br>
    rolled into a tiny scroll. She picks it up and unrolls<br>
    it to reveal a hand-written NOTE. She reads it<br>
    aloud...</p>
  <p>21 INSERT - THE NOTE</p>
  <p> As Troi reads:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Meet me in Transporter Room Three<br>
    at nineteen hundred hours. It's<br>
    important.</p>
  <p>22 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> Troi thinks a moment -- what's this all about?<br>
    Curiosity gets the best of her; she sets down her tea<br>
    and EXITS...</p>
  <p>23 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Moments later. Troi ENTERS and looks around -- there's<br>
    nobody here. Then she sees an ORCHID sitting on the<br>
    Transporter console. She smiles and picks it up...<br>
    there is another tiny scroll attached. She smells the<br>
    flower... then unravels the scroll and reads the handwritten<br>
    note:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/19/93 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (reads)<br>
    It pulses unendingly<br>
    All through the night;<br>
    Seek out the crystal<br>
    That powers our flight.</p>
  <p> Troi smiles as she realizes she's being led on a<br>
    treasure hunt. She thinks about the clue for a moment,<br>
    then moves off down the hall...</p>
  <p>24 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Geordi and a few N.D.s working. Troi ENTERS and looks<br>
    around, then heads toward the main core where the<br>
    dilithium chamber is located.</p>
  <p> Geordi turns and sees her. He reacts to the unexpected<br>
    sight of Troi peering at the dilithium chamber, holding<br>
    an orchid, and moves to her.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Can I help you with something,<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> Just then she finds what she's looking for: hanging<br>
    from a string under the dilithium chamber is another<br>
    hand-written scroll, this one attached to a small, foil-wrapped<br>
    CHOCOLATE HEART. Geordi reacts as he gets a<br>
    glimpse of it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No -- thanks, anyway.</p>
  <p> Geordi is about to ask what this is all about but Troi<br>
    just smiles and EXITS. Off his confused reaction...</p>
  <p>25 INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Troi stops outside Engineering and unrolls the<br>
    scroll...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (reads)<br>
    What the future holds<br>
    No one can know<br>
    But forward we look<br>
    And Forward you go...</p>
  <p> She pops the chocolate in her mouth, and without<br>
    hesitation, heads toward the Turbolift...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>26 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> as Troi ENTERS and looks around... moves across the<br>
    room toward the windows... and stops at what she sees.<br>
    Sitting on one of the tables is a GIFT BOX. Next to it<br>
    is a small VASE filled with water. She puts the orchid<br>
    in it, smiles at how much thought went into this. She<br>
    looks around to see if the person responsible is<br>
    nearby, then opens the box.</p>
  <p> Inside is a flat piece of slate, irregular in shape and<br>
    slightly larger than a book. On its surface is etched<br>
    an image. We see that Troi recognizes it instantly.</p>
  <p>27 INSERT - THE ETCHING</p>
  <p> It depicts a spectacular waterfall, cascading off a<br>
    cliff.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    (off-camera)<br>
    The Janaran falls...</p>
  <p>28 RESUME SCENE - INCLUDING LIEUTENANT RIKER</p>
  <p> as he approaches. Troi turns and sees him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I remember. Where did you get<br>
    this?</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I made it... a few years ago, down<br>
    on the station.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    You made this?</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    (laughs)<br>
    You should have seen the first<br>
    two. It took me a while to get a<br>
    fine enough beam from the phaser.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's lovely. Thank you.</p>
  <p> He nods, shows no embarrassment over having gone to<br>
    such lengths to get her here.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/18/93 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Do you have time to sit and talk<br>
    for a while?</p>
  <p> She nods, and he gestures to a waiter as they sit at<br>
    the table. Neither one of them is quite sure what to<br>
    say at first, and they find themselves looking down at<br>
    the etching.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I wanted to remember... our last<br>
    night together.</p>
  <p> She takes this in silently, not wanting to say anything<br>
    to encourage any more talk about the period they were<br>
    lovers. She steers the conversation elsewhere.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How does it feel being with people<br>
    again?</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Great...<br>
    (admitting it)<br>
    A little strange...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    For a long time, I did whatever I<br>
    wanted, whenever I wanted; it's<br>
    hard to get used to taking orders<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I can imagine.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I guess I'm going to have to if I<br>
    want to get my career going.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Is that what you've decided to do?</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Don't you remember? How I wanted<br>
    to make Captain by the time I was<br>
    thirty-five?</p>
  <p> He smiles at his youthful cockiness.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I'm a little behind schedule, I'll<br>
    admit.</p>
  <p> He shrugs, and Troi is struck by his optimistic<br>
    attitude.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's good that you don't feel...<br>
    set back.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I do. But I promised myself that<br>
    if I ever got out of there, I'd<br>
    make up for lost time.</p>
  <p> Troi is encouraged to hear this.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Things are a little more<br>
    complicated than I thought they'd<br>
    be... but I'm not going to let<br>
    anything stop me from getting what<br>
    I want.</p>
  <p> She looks down, knowing what he means by this. A<br>
    Waiter approaches and sets two glasses down.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Thanks.</p>
  <p> He leans forward, looks at Troi.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I can't tell you how many times I<br>
    thought about you... about us.<br>
    The first few weeks after the<br>
    evacuation, I was sure they'd find<br>
    a way to get through the<br>
    distortion field and come back for<br>
    me.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I even thought we'd meet on Risa<br>
    like we planned.<br>
    (he shakes his head)<br>
    But the days kept going by and<br>
    nobody came. Then I realized why.<br>
    They thought I'd been killed in<br>
    the beam out. As far as anyone<br>
    knew, there was no one to come<br>
    back for.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I figured they probably held a<br>
    memorial service for me.<br>
    Somehow... it made me feel<br>
    better.</p>
  <p> Troi smiles at his confession.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I can understand that.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    You were there... all in black.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Very flattering on you, by the<br>
    way.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I'm sure I looked terrible -- my<br>
    eyes all red and swollen from<br>
    crying.</p>
  <p> Somehow, sharing his fantasy is strangely intimate.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Sometimes I'd look up into the sky<br>
    and think that maybe, if I tried<br>
    hard enough, I could somehow make<br>
    you... feel my presence. I<br>
    thought that if I could let you<br>
    know I was still alive... maybe<br>
    you'd wait for me.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I know it's crazy, but there were<br>
    a few times that... that I<br>
    could've sworn --</p>
  <p> Suddenly he feels ridiculous and waves this off.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    What am I talking about?</p>
  <p> But Troi's face shows no sign she finds this<br>
    ridiculous.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The other day, when I told you how<br>
    Commander Riker and I didn't meet<br>
    on Risa... what I didn't say was<br>
    how disappointed I was.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    You didn't have to. I knew.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I started hearing from him less<br>
    and less... I knew his career was<br>
    taking him away from me, but I<br>
    didn't want to believe it was<br>
    over. I spent a lot of time<br>
    thinking about him, wondering<br>
    where he was, what he was doing.</p>
  <p> She looks up, meets his eyes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Sometimes I'd look up into the<br>
    sky... and imagine that he knew,<br>
    that he could sense me thinking<br>
    about him.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker looks at her. Is she saying that<br>
    maybe, just maybe, he was right?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Who knows? Maybe one night... you<br>
    and I were both looking up at the<br>
    same star. You were thinking<br>
    about me... and in a way, I was<br>
    thinking about you.</p>
  <p> They look at each other, somehow comforted by the<br>
    possibility. They pick up their drinks; their eyes<br>
    meet for a moment. Off the clink of their glasses...</p>
  <p>29 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it orbits Nervala IV.</p>
  <p>30 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> as Commander Riker ENTERS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You wanted to see me, Sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Number One. Come in.</p>
  <p> Riker moves into the room.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant Riker came to see me<br>
    about the away mission.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts, wondering if he'd made a complaint of<br>
    some sort.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He believes the only way to<br>
    retrieve the database is by<br>
    directly accessing the main core<br>
    underneath the station.</p>
  <p> This isn't what Riker was expecting, but he's not happy<br>
    to hear Lieutenant Riker came to the Captain directly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Seismic activity has made the<br>
    caverns very unstable. In my<br>
    opinion, it's too risky.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He said he'd been down there quite<br>
    recently; he seems confident it<br>
    can be done safely.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There's a good chance we can<br>
    retrieve the database from one of<br>
    the consoles inside the station.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But if that doesn't work, it'll be<br>
    eight years before we get another<br>
    chance.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lieutenant Riker's plan is more<br>
    dangerous, but I'll admit, it has<br>
    a better chance of succeeding.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Given the importance of this data,<br>
    I think it's worth the risk.</p>
  <p> Riker accepts his decision without hesitation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll look over the schematics and<br>
    draw up a mission plan.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure Lieutenant Riker would be<br>
    happy to help you with that.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/19/93 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (even)<br>
    I'll talk to him.</p>
  <p> Riker takes his leave. Off Picard's expression as he<br>
    watches him go.</p>
  <p>31 INT. ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Commander Riker ENTERS to find Lieutenant Riker working<br>
    at the pool table.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I just spoke with the Captain<br>
    about your mission recommendation.<br>
    I'd appreciate it if next time you<br>
    came to me first.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I tried to, yesterday on the<br>
    station. You wouldn't hear me<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I heard you, Lieutenant. And I<br>
    rejected your plan.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/18/93 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> That should be the end of it, but Lieutenant Riker goes<br>
    on to ask:</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    May I ask what the Captain<br>
    decided?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He's going with your<br>
    recommendation, but that's not the<br>
    point.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Isn't it?</p>
  <p> Riker reacts.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If you think I'm coming down on<br>
    you because the Captain overruled<br>
    me, think again. I happen to<br>
    disagree with his decision, but<br>
    he's my commanding officer and I<br>
    follow his orders. Just so<br>
    there's no confusion, I'm your<br>
    commanding officer and I expect<br>
    you to do the same. If you can't,<br>
    then you don't have a place on my<br>
    Away Team.</p>
  <p> Their eyes lock and for a moment we don't know what<br>
    Lieutenant Riker will do. Finally, he backs down.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're meeting in the Observation<br>
    lounge at fourteen hundred hours<br>
    to draw up a mission plan.</p>
  <p> Riker turns and EXITS. Off Lieutenant Riker's<br>
    expression as he watches him go.</p>

  <p> where Troi and Beverly are talking while they do slow,<br>
    controlled martial arts forms, dressed in their robes.<br>
    Troi is animatedly recounting her evening with<br>
    Lieutenant Riker.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What happened then?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (simply)<br>
    He walked me to my quarters.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    What happened then?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (dismissing this)<br>
    Beverly --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm just asking.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's been over between Wil and me<br>
    for a long time.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He's not Wil. He is, but -- you<br>
    know what I mean.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I do. But... it's hard for me to<br>
    separate my feelings for them.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Deanna... just because things<br>
    turned out the way they did<br>
    between you and Commander Riker...<br>
    that doesn't mean you shouldn't<br>
    let things with Lieutenant Riker<br>
    take their own course.</p>
  <p> Troi takes this in... she hasn't come to any<br>
    conclusions.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I should have known you'd<br>
    encourage me.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Isn't that why you brought it up?</p>
  <p> They laugh at this until the door OPENS and Lieutenant<br>
    Riker ENTERS the gym, dressed in work-out clothes. He<br>
    sees them and gives a little wave, then heads over to<br>
    another part of the gym and starts stretching. Beverly<br>
    drops her form.</p>

    Beverly.</p>
  <p> But Beverly just smiles and moves away. As she passes<br>
    by Lieutenant Riker:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Bye.</p>
  <p> Beverly EXITS. Troi picks up with her exercises again.<br>
    Lieutenant Riker watches her for a beat, then<br>
    approaches.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Is that some form of tai-chi-chuan?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    They're Klingon exercises,<br>
    actually. Lieutenant Worf has<br>
    been teaching a class.</p>
  <p> He moves around in front of her, watching for a moment.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    The forms are very similar.</p>
  <p> He takes a stance in front of her.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Do that last move again.</p>
  <p> She repeats the move, which involves taking a step<br>
    forward and thrusting out an arm. Lieutenant Riker<br>
    parries the thrust with a stylized move of his own.<br>
    This is all done in a slow, controlled manner.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You just did the KoH-man-ara.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    In tai-chi-chuan, it's called the<br>
    crane block.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I had no idea they were so<br>
    similar.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Let's try something else.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - ACT THREE 39.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> They take their stances, and this time he pivots and<br>
    thrusts; she blocks the move with one of her own. They<br>
    smile at the continued similarity in these two martial<br>
    arts, then move into a third parry and thrust, a little<br>
    faster this time. This one takes them into close<br>
    proximity to each other, so that their faces are quite<br>
    close. Their eyes meet for a moment, but Troi breaks<br>
    it off by pivoting and twirling around to take another<br>
    stance.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Very nice. Worf's a good teacher.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker executes another move, and Troi<br>
    anticipates and counters with one of her own -- though<br>
    the pace quickens, it is still controlled and stylized.<br>
    He changes tack but Troi is there, and this time she<br>
    takes him smoothly down on to the mat, so that he ends<br>
    up on his back and she ends up on one knee.</p>
  <p> She smiles down at him, and because he's enjoying<br>
    himself too much to take it badly, he smiles back.</p>
  <p> When their eyes meet they suddenly realize how close<br>
    they are physically... there is a charged moment... but<br>
    Lieutenant Riker decides not to push it and makes to<br>
    get up.</p>
  <p> Unexpectedly, Troi doesn't let him. She holds his gaze<br>
    for a moment, then lowers herself into his arms and<br>
    kisses him full on the mouth. His hands reach up along<br>
    her back as they continue to kiss...</p>

  <p> Where various N.D. Supernumeraries are enjoying<br>
    themselves. Commander Riker is standing near the<br>

  <p> Troi ENTERS and looks around. She sees Riker and heads<br>
    toward him. He's lost in thought and doesn't notice<br>
    her approach.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Hello, Wil.</p>
  <p> He turns at the sound of her voice, smiles when he sees<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Deanna...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I wanted to talk to you about<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> He looks at her for a long moment, his expression<br>
    unreadable.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (gently)<br>
    If you want to be with him... you<br>
    don't have to ask my permission.</p>
  <p> She reacts, clearly surprised that he sensed what is<br>
    going on.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    There's a certain look in your<br>
    eyes. I know... you used to have<br>
    it for me.</p>
  <p> She shares his smile, then gestures to a table. Once<br>
    they're seated:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We've both had relationships with<br>
    other people before; but this is<br>
    different.</p>
  <p> He smiles at her understatement.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I didn't know how you would feel<br>
    about it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Flattered.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Sort of.</p>
  <p> She smiles at this.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It must be very strange for you.<br>
    I know it is for me.</p>
  <p> Riker nods, takes a moment to think.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ever since he came aboard... I<br>
    keep finding myself thinking<br>
    about... the choices you and I<br>
    made.</p>
  <p> They look at each other.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Me too.</p>
  <p> There's no need for them to say anything out loud.<br>
    They both know what's between them, the complicated<br>
    history of their relationship.</p>
  <p> After a long moment, he reaches across the table and<br>
    takes her hand.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Just do one thing for me... be<br>
    careful.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Wil... I know you and he have had<br>
    some problems --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We have. But that's not what I'm<br>
    talking about.<br>

  <p> RIKER (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If he'd made it off that planet<br>
    instead of me... don't you think<br>
    he would have made the same<br>
    choices I did?</p>
  <p> Troi is struck by this insight.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I just don't want you to get<br>
    hurt... again.</p>
  <p> Troi looks at him and knows he's not speaking to her<br>
    from hurt or jealousy, but from friendship. He's given<br>
    her a lot to think about...</p>
  <p>33A INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)<br>
    (FORMERLY SCENE 36)</p>
  <p> Where Commander Riker, Data and Worf are playing poker.<br>
    Data has already folded and Worf now shows his hand<br>
    with a confident air.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Two pair.</p>
  <p> Riker holds his cards for a beat, then lays them down<br>
    with a smile.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Three of a kind.</p>
  <p> Worf glowers -- he's been having a bad night. Riker<br>
    starts raking in the chips.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'd like to thank you both for<br>
    your very generous contributions.</p>
  <p> Data prepares to deal another hand. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> Riker is facing the door, so when it OPENS, he's the<br>
    first to see Lieutenant Riker standing there. There is<br>
    an awkward moment.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I thought -- you'd be alone.<br>
    Excuse me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - ACT FOUR 42A.</p>
  <p>33A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He moves as if to leave.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why don't you join us?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/18/93 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>33A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker hesitates for a beat, but when he sees<br>
    the welcoming looks from the others he decides to come<br>
    in.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Why not?</p>
  <p> Riker stands and starts to cross around the table to<br>
    get him a chair. Lieutenant Riker sees one right by<br>
    the door but Riker's trombone is laying on the seat.<br>
    He picks it up intending to find another place for it,<br>
    but when he has it in his hand he recognizes it as his<br>
    trombone, the one he had learned to play on.</p>
  <p> As he looks down at it Riker enters the frame... there<br>
    is an awkward moment as Lieutenant Riker hands it back<br>
    to him -- two people can't share the same momentos.<br>
    Riker puts the trombone elsewhere and Lieutenant Riker<br>
    slides the chair to the table.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The game is five card draw, no<br>
    limit.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker nods and Data pushes a pile of chips<br>
    at him. Lieutenant Riker joins the ante, and Data<br>
    starts dealing cards -- first to Lieutenant Riker, who<br>
    is at his left, then to Worf, who is across from him,<br>
    then to Commander Riker, who is at his right, across<br>
    from Lieutenant Riker.</p>
  <p> Everyone sizes up their hand. Data turns to Lieutenant<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Three.</p>
  <p> He puts down three cards and Data deals him another<br>
    three.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Mister Worf?</p>
  <p> Worf thinks for a beat then frowns.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Four.</p>
  <p> Riker smiles at Worf's bad luck as Data and Worf<br>
    exchange cards. Data then turns to Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    None for me.</p>

  <p>33A CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Everyone sizes up their new hand. After a moment, Data<br>
    turns to Lieutenant Riker.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You control the bet.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker fingers his chips for a beat, his face<br>
    even.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Fifty.</p>
  <p> Everyone reacts -- this is quite high for this table.<br>
    Everyone turns to Worf. He glowers at his cards and<br>
    puts them down.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Fold.</p>
  <p> All eyes turn to Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (tossing in his chips)<br>
    I'm in.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker looks at him.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    You didn't take any cards -- you<br>
    must be holding something. Why<br>
    not make it sweeter?</p>
  <p> Questioning a man's poker game used to get people<br>
    killed, but Commander Riker just shrugs it off with a<br>
    smile.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No thanks.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Playing it safe?</p>
  <p> There's something almost accusatory in Lieutenant<br>
    Riker's tone. Riker regards him evenly for a moment,<br>
    then turns to Data.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You in?</p>
  <p> Data has been watching this exchange with fascination.<br>
    He gets back in the game and matches the bet.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will see your fifty and call.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>33A CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker looks at his cards for a moment, then<br>
    pushes in another hundred.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Staying in will cost you another<br>
    hundred.</p>
  <p> Everyone reacts.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The dealer folds.</p>
  <p> Commander Riker studies his double's face for a long<br>
    moment. Unexpectedly, he breaks into a broad grin.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I spent too much time practicing<br>
    in the mirror to be fooled by that<br>
    face. You're bluffing.</p>
  <p> Though Commander Riker says this good-naturedly,<br>
    Lieutenant Riker's face hardens.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    If there's one thing I thought<br>
    would be clear by now, it's that<br>
    you and I play things a little<br>
    differently.</p>
  <p> Riker stiffens at his pointed tone.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'll see who comes out on top.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I thought you didn't mind settling<br>
    for second. Commander.</p>
  <p> His emphasis on Riker's rank is all too clear. The<br>
    tension between them is suddenly out in the open.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've never settled for anything in<br>
    my life. I've made choices that<br>
    some people may not understand,<br>
    but I know what I want -- and I<br>
    know what I've got. You'd be<br>
    lucky to do as well.<br>

    Lieutenant.</p>

  <p> Lieutenant Riker bristles.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (bets)<br>
    I'll see your hundred and call.</p>
  <p> Riker sits back and waits to see what Lieutenant Riker<br>
    will do. Lieutenant Riker assembles a stack of chips<br>
    worth three hundred and bets them.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Three hundred.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Now I know you're bluffing.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    (sharp)<br>
    Are you in or not?</p>
  <p> Riker loses his patience with this.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why don't we just get this over<br>
    with? I'll match your three, and<br>
    raise you whatever you have left.</p>
  <p> Riker slides some more chips in, eye-balling the chips<br>
    to match what Lieutenant Riker has left. Their eyes<br>
    lock, Lieutenant Riker's gaze conveys barely controlled<br>
    anger.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/19/93 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>33A CONTINUED: (6)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well?</p>
  <p> Riker's question hangs in the air for a moment... he's<br>
    called Lieutenant Riker's bluff. Both men are on edge<br>
    and there's a sense this could easily get physical.<br>
    Suddenly Lieutenant Riker pushes all his chips directly<br>
    into Riker's pile.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Take it. You win.</p>
  <p> He pushes his chair back and stands, eyes Commander<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    You were dealt the better hand,<br>
    Commander... all the way around.</p>
  <p> He turns and EXITS. Off everyone's reactions...</p>

  <p> Troi is alone, contemplating her situation. After a<br>
    moment, the door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> The door OPENS to reveal Lieutenant Riker.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I'm sorry to just drop by like<br>
    this... but there's something<br>
    important I need to talk to you<br>
    about.</p>
  <p> She gestures that he come in.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Captain Picard made some inquiries --<br>
    he helped me find a posting on the<br>
    Gandhi.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker can barely contain his enthusiasm, but<br>
    Troi doesn't know how she feels about this.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Considering how long I've been out<br>
    of commission, it's an amazing<br>
    opportunity.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/17/93 - ACT FOUR 48.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Troi keeps an even tone.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    When would you leave?</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    About a week.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I see.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Deanna...</p>
  <p> He moves to her.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    After I've served on the ship for<br>
    six months, I'll be eligible to<br>
    bring family aboard.</p>
  <p> Troi's face almost blanches when she hears these words,<br>
    but Lieutenant Riker is holding her so close he doesn't<br>
    see.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    If we got married...</p>
  <p> Troi pulls away.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You said those exact words to me<br>
    once before... when you first went<br>
    to serve on the Potemkin.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I remember.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I got held up for a while.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But if you hadn't... what would<br>
    have happened between us?</p>
  <p> He looks at her, knows what she's asking.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I wouldn't've made the mistake of<br>
    letting you go. I know that much.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't know if I can believe<br>
    that.</p>

  <p>35 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> She takes a breath, makes an admission she hasn't made<br>
    before.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It took me a long time to get over<br>
    what happened between Commander<br>
    Riker and me. I don't know if I<br>
    want to put myself in that<br>
    position again.</p>
  <p> He moves to her, tries to reassure her..</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I would never hurt you, Deanna.</p>
  <p> She looks at him, torn.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's not just that... I've worked<br>
    hard to make a life for myself on<br>
    the Enterprise. I'm happy here.</p>
  <p> His plans for their life together seem to be falling<br>
    apart in front of his eyes.</p>

  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    If the situation were different,<br>

    while he's aboard.</p>
  <p> Troi can't deny this.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I know.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker looks away, pained by the thought that<br>
    after all that's happened, he might lose her again.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Are you saying it's over?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> He looks at her -- at least there's hope. She moves<br>
    toward him, touches his face.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I just don't know if I'm ready to<br>
    give up my life here.</p>
  <p> He takes this in.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Maybe we both need time to think.</p>
  <p> He nods. They look at each other for a long moment,<br>
    then he goes to the door.</p>

  <p> Worf and Lieutenant Riker are at the center console;<br>
    Commander Riker and Data are at a wall console.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Once we restore the servo-link,<br>
    you can shunt the database up to<br>
    this console.</p>
  <p> Worf acknowledges and Lieutenant Riker moves to Data.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Ready, Commander?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Lieutenant Riker)<br>
    You're with me, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker reacts -- he'd rather not go down<br>
    there with Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I thought Commander Data's<br>
    expertise in --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It doesn't take that much<br>
    expertise to repair a servo-link.<br>
    You and I can handle it.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker stiffens at being cut off -- but<br>
    follows as Commander Riker moves off.</p>
  <p> The two Rikers head to the back of the station and EXIT<br>
    frame. Data watches as they leave, then turns to work<br>
    the console. After a moment.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    I am curious about something,<br>
    Lieutenant. If you met a double<br>
    of yourself, would you find it<br>
    difficult to interact with him?</p>
  <p> Worf considers.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I think so.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am not... easy to get along<br>
    with.</p>
  <p> Data can't disagree.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But Commander Riker and Lieutenant<br>
    Riker are. Yet they seem to have<br>
    trouble getting along with each<br>
    another.</p>
  <p> Worf nods an acknowledgement. Data thinks for a<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have found that humans value<br>
    their uniqueness, their sense that<br>
    they are different from every one<br>
    else. The existence of a double<br>
    would preclude that feeling.<br>
    Could that be the source of<br>
    friction?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Perhaps it is more a matter of<br>
    seeing something in your double...<br>
    something you don't like about<br>
    yourself.</p>
  <p> Data nods thoughtfully, then returns to work.</p>
  <p>39 INT. THE CAVERN (OPTICAL)</p>

  <p> A series of pipes and conduits run parallel to each<br>
    other along the ceiling, and there are structural<br>
    supports at various places shoring up the walls.</p>
  <p> In front of them is a chasm that is spanned by a bridgelike<br>
    scaffolding. The core is visible on the far side,<br>
    but they can't see the point where the bridge touches<br>
    their side of the chasm.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    There's the core over there.</p>
  <p> Riker nods and waits for him to lead the way, but<br>
    Lieutenant Riker just stands there.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you waiting for something?</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Your order. Sir.</p>
  <p> Riker looks at him for an explanation.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    How would you like me to get<br>
    there?</p>
  <p> Riker sees that Lt. Riker doesn't intend to make this<br>
    easy.</p>

    You've been down here &quot;dozens&quot; of<br>
    times -- I'm sure you know the<br>
    best way.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker hears the slight tinge of sarcasm in<br>
    his voice but ignores it, acts as if he's just trying<br>
    to &quot;follow orders.&quot;</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir. I do.</p>
  <p> He moves off -- Riker shakes his head and follows.</p>
  <p> They round a bend and come to a doorway that leads out<br>
    across the bridge. But a conduit in the ceiling has<br>
    come unmoored and fallen across the doorway, rupturing<br>

  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    It's leaking ion radiation.</p>
  <p> They back off, moving around the bend to put some rockface<br>

    It wasn't there before; it must<br>
    have happened recently.</p>
  <p> Riker frowns.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    If we have to repair this conduit,<br>
    we won't have time to access the<br>
    computer core.</p>
  <p> Lt. Riker is all but admitting that his plan may cause<br>
    them to fail.</p>
  <p> But Riker is looking up at the ceiling, eyeing the maze<br>
    of conduits up there.</p>
  <p> As Lieutenant Riker watches, Riker starts tracing the<br>
    path of the broken conduit, using its distinctive colorcoding<br>
    to track it against the other pipes. He follows<br>
    it back toward the elevator area where the conduits run<br>
    down along a wall and disappear into the floor. He<br>
    finds a VALVE in the conduit and starts trying to close<br>
    it. He strains for a moment and it finally gives.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Scan it now.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    It worked. Radiation levels are<br>
    dropping to normal levels.</p>
  <p> Riker nods and starts heading back toward the door that<br>
    leads out onto the scaffolding. As he passes<br>
    Lieutenant Riker:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Next time don't give up so easily.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/19/93 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker's jaw tightens as he watches Riker<br>
    walk past. He turns and follows.</p>
  <p>40 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker clambers past the broken conduit and starts<br>
    heading across the scaffolding... Lieutenant Riker<br>
    follows a few steps behind.</p>
  <p> A few yards into it, Riker takes a look over the side --<br>
    we can see from his face that it's a long way down...</p>
  <p> As they walk, the scaffolding creaks occasionally under<br>
    their weight. Lieutenant Riker is about half-way<br>
    across when a segment of the walkway suddenly gives way<br>
    underneath his feet.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts and reaches back for him, but the segment<br>
    Lieutenant Riker is on flaps down like a hinge,<br>
    attached to the rest of the scaffolding only on one end<br>
    (the end closest to the core).</p>
  <p> Riker just manages to grab hold of one of Lieutenant<br>
    Riker's hands.</p>
  <p>41 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker is hanging over the abyss, supported<br>
    only by Riker's grip. Riker is on his belly, an arm<br>
    reaching down toward Lieutenant Riker.</p>
  <p>42 INSERT - THEIR HANDS</p>
  <p> clasped to each other's wrists, as they struggle to<br>
    keep a grip.</p>
  <p>43 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> as the weight of Lieutenant Riker's body begins to pull<br>
    Riker forward.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm being pulled in --</p>
  <p> Their eyes meet. It is clear to both of them that<br>
    Riker might have to let go to keep from being pulled in<br>
    himself.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/23/93 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Let go.</p>
  <p> But Riker ignores him, reaches back with his free hand<br>
    to try and grab a hold of something -- but there's<br>
    nothing there.</p>
  <p> The scaffolding groans under the pressure of their<br>
    combined weights -- it's threatening to tear loose and<br>
    plunge them both to their deaths.</p>
  <p>44 INSERT - THEIR HANDS</p>
  <p> as Lieutenant Riker lets go of Rikers hand -- the only<br>
    thing holding him up is Riker's grip on his wrist.</p>
  <p>45 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Let go.</p>
  <p> But Riker won't do it.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    One of us has to make it out of<br>
    here --</p>
  <p> Riker manages to hook a foot behind one of the supports<br>
    that hold up the handrail. He reaches his other hand<br>
    down for Lieutenant Riker to grab hold of.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Take my hand --</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    No --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Take it!</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker sees the resolve in Riker's face. He<br>
    reaches and takes Riker's other hand.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Climb --</p>
  <p> Supporting his weight with one hand, Lieutenant Riker<br>
    reaches up with the other to get a grip farther up<br>
    Riker's arm. He then switches hands and reaches<br>
    further still.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/19/93 - ACT FIVE 55A.</p>
  <p>45 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Both men are breathing hard as they strain through this<br>
    arduous process.</p>
  <p> Finally, Lieutenant Riker is able to crawl up and over<br>
    Riker's back onto the scaffolding, then help Riker up.</p>
  <p> Once they're both on firm ground, they make their way<br>
    across the rest of the bridge.</p>
  <p> When they're safe on the other side, they both look<br>
    back at the broken segment that almost cost them their<br>
    lives.</p>
  <p> As they try to catch their breath, their eyes meet.<br>
    They regard each other for a moment... then move toward<br>
    the core. As they set to work we cut to:</p>

  <p>50 INT. LT. RIKER'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> where he is packing his few belongings. The door<br>
    CHIMES.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> The door OPENS to reveal Troi.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/19/93 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker gestures that she come in. He knows<br>
    she's come to give him her decision but he's got a bad<br>
    feeling about what it's going to be. To cover, he<br>
    returns to his packing. After a moment.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I understand the Gandhi is going<br>
    on a terraforming mission to the<br>
    Lagana Sector.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    (nods)<br>
    It'll take four months just to get<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - 03/19/93 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> They look at each other for a long moment. Troi tries<br>
    to break it to him gently.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I won't be going with you.</p>
  <p> His face betrays his disappointment.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I guess I'm not surprised.</p>
  <p> She moves to him, but he can't look at her right now;<br>
    the emotions are too raw.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm not ready to give up my life<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> She touches his face, gently turns him so that he's<br>
    looking at her. With meaning:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Not yet.</p>
  <p> He realizes what she's saying: maybe, someday... she<br>
    will be ready. He reaches to take her hands, nods that<br>
    he understands. She smiles, grateful to hear the<br>
    words.</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES. He looks at her to see if they should<br>
    ignore it, but she nods that it's all right.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> The door OPENS to reveal Riker, holding a carrying<br>
    case. When he sees the two of them:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sorry --</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    It's all right.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I wanted to give you something...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/24/93 - ACT FIVE 58A.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> He steps in and hands Lieutenant Riker the case.<br>
    Lieutenant Riker recognizes it as the trombone case he<br>
    had so many years ago. He looks at Riker, unsure...</p>
  <p> But when he opens it he finds his trombone... the one<br>
    he learned to play on. He knows what it means to Riker<br>
    and is amazed that he's willing to give it up.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    My quarters are full of things<br>
    that used to be yours. I figured<br>
    you should at least have this.</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Riker looks down at the trombone in his<br>
    hands. Words can't express his appreciation.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Thanks.</p>
  <p> Riker nods. He steps back as if to leave.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Good luck, Wil.</p>
  <p> This is the first time Riker's called him by their<br>
    given name and it doesn't go unnoticed.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Actually... I was thinking of<br>
    going with the name Thomas.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Your middle name.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (with a grin)<br>
    I guess we are different. I never<br>
    really cared for it.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I've always kind of liked it.</p>
  <p> They share a smile at this.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Well... I better get going.</p>
  <p> He picks up his things and crosses toward the door. He<br>
    glances at Riker.</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    Take care of her.</p>
  <p> Riker meets his eye, nods. Lieutenant Riker turns to<br>
    Troi, leans in and kisses her, brief but tender. He<br>
    looks at her with a playful smile.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Second Chances&quot; - REV. 03/23/93 - ACT FIVE 58B.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> LT. RIKER<br>
    I waited a long time. I can wait<br>
    a little longer.</p>
  <p> She smiles, and he EXITS. Troi watches him go, her<br>
    face betraying the complex emotions the last few days<br>
    have elicited.</p>
  <p> Riker watches her silently. He knows she's hurting --<br>
    if she needs him, he'll be there to take care of her...<br>
    just like Lieutenant Riker asked...</p>
  <p> Off this moment we...</p>
