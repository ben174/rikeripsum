  <p> STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION <br>
    &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. ASYLUM CELL</p>
  <p> An austere room -- devoid of furnishings, except for a<br>
    BED and a DOOR with a small thick-paned window. RIKER<br>
    is sitting on the bed, dressed in casual hospital-type<br>
    clothing. He is trying to maintain control, but there<br>
    is an underlying tension. He looks strung out, like<br>
    he's been at this for a long time...</p>
  <p> He speaks to an offscreen DOCTOR who we never clearly<br>
    see (this will be Data, speaking with a distinctive<br>
    accent so we don't recognize his voice).</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Doctor)<br>
    You're absolutely right, Doctor.<br>
    In fact, right now it's hard to<br>
    imagine ever hurting anyone...</p>
  <p> DOCTOR (O.S.)<br>
    How do you feel about that person<br>
    you used to be?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I feel... terrible. But thanks to<br>
    you, I'm much better now. And I<br>
    feel confident that when I leave,<br>
    I'll be ready to take my place in<br>
    society again.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR (O.S.)<br>
    When do you think that will be?</p>
  <p> Riker looks at him... gives him a nervous smile...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well... now. Right away.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR (O.S.)<br>
    What makes you say that?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You said when I was able to accept<br>
    what I'd done, and understood the<br>
    consequences of my actions, that<br>
    I'd be free to go.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DOCTOR (O.S.)<br>
    &quot;Free to go.&quot; Are you saying you<br>
    don't think you should stand trial<br>
    for what you've done?</p>
  <p> Riker pauses... he's skittish, trying to please the<br>
    Doctor and say the right thing -- but he's losing the<br>
    fight to stay calm.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm looking forward to proving my<br>
    innocence...</p>
  <p> DOCTOR (O.S.)<br>
    I thought you said you accepted<br>
    what you'd done.</p>
  <p> Riker tries to backtrack.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But that's not what I meant. I...<br>
    I meant that I was sick when it<br>
    happened. I wasn't responsible<br>
    for what I did...</p>
  <p> A tense beat.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR (O.S.)<br>
    How do I know that you're not just<br>
    telling me what I want to hear?</p>
  <p> Riker doesn't have a response.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR (O.S.)<br>
    (doubtful)<br>
    Perhaps we should continue this<br>
    discussion next week...</p>
  <p> Riker's temper flares -- he stands.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No. I want to talk about it<br>
    now...</p>
  <p> DOCTOR (O.S.)<br>
    (calmly)<br>
    You're starting to sound angry<br>
    again. Maybe you need another<br>
    treatment...</p>
  <p> Riker drops all pretense of being the &quot;good patient&quot;<br>
    and lets his genuine feelings come out.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What I need is to get out of this<br>
    cell. I'm locked up day and<br>
    night... you control every<br>
    move... tell me what to eat, what<br>
    to think, what to say...</p>
  <p> Riker moves around the room, liked a caged animal.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And when I show a glimmer of<br>
    independent thought, you strap me<br>
    down, inject me with drugs and<br>
    call it a &quot;treatment.&quot;</p>
  <p> DOCTOR (O.S.)<br>
    You're becoming agitated...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You bet I'm agitated! I may be<br>
    surrounded by insanity, but I'm<br>
    not insane. And I won't let you<br>
    or anyone... me think I am....</p>
  <p> Riker hesitates, stumbling over his words... tries to<br>
    correct his last statement.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I won't let you or anyone think<br>
    that...</p>
  <p> Riker's whole demeanor changes -- he stops being the<br>
    tortured patient and becomes just Wil Riker. He looks<br>
    offscreen and speaks to somebody.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sorry. Can we take it from<br>
    &quot;You're becoming agitated&quot;?</p>
  <p>2 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> to REVEAL that we have been in the ship's THEATER. A<br>
    cell is set up on a stage. The theater seats are<br>
    empty, except for BEVERLY, who is directing the play.<br>
    DATA -- who is playing the Doctor -- is also on the<br>
    cell stage.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to all)<br>
    Why don't we break for tonight.<br>
    I think we've made a lot of<br>
    progress.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But I'm still not confident about<br>
    that final speech...</p>
  <p> Beverly moves to Riker onstage.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There's such a thing as over-rehearsing,<br>
    Wil. You'll do just<br>
    fine.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Try to relax. You're resisting<br>
    the character. Let yourself feel<br>
    what he's feeling.</p>
  <p> Riker is frustrated.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (unsure)<br>
    Maybe I'm just not right for this<br>
    part...</p>
  <p> Data chimes in.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Most humanoids have the potential<br>
    to be irrational. Perhaps you<br>
    should attempt to access that part<br>
    of your psyche.</p>
  <p> Beverly nods, tries to give Riker the insight he needs.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Haven't you ever felt at odds with<br>
    everyone -- like the whole world<br>
    was against you?</p>
  <p> Riker thinks.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yeah... my first year at the<br>
    Academy...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - TEASER 4A.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Try to tap into that feeling.<br>
    That's what your character is<br>
    going through in this scene.</p>
  <p> Riker nods, feeling a little better.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll work on it...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It'll be wonderful. You're going<br>
    to knock 'em dead.</p>
  <p> Riker nods. As everyone moves to go...</p>
  <p>3 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> A few minutes later. Riker walking along, still<br>
    dressed in his inmate costume. He's practicing lines<br>
    from his final speech, trying to get it right.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    &quot;You control every move... tell me<br>
    what to eat, what to think, what<br>
    to say... &quot;</p>
  <p> He tries again, this time with more emphasis:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    &quot;What to eat, what to think, what<br>
    to say... &quot;<br>
    (beat)<br>
    &quot;And when I show a glimmer of<br>
    independent thought, you strap me<br>
    down, inject me with drugs and<br>
    call it a 'treatment'... &quot;</p>
  <p> Over the above, a CREWPERSON walks past and gives Riker<br>
    a curious look. Riker is too absorbed to notice. He<br>
    stops at a Turbolift and taps a button by the door. As<br>
    he waits...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    &quot;I may be surrounded by insanity,<br>
    but I'm not insane --&quot;</p>
  <p> The doors open and Riker runs directly into an ALIEN<br>
    LIEUTENANT. The Lieutenant stares at him with intense<br>
    eyes, face utterly expressionless. Riker steps back,<br>
    startled...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Excuse me...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The Lieutenant walks past him. Riker enters the<br>
    Turbolift, glances back to see --</p>
  <p> The Lieutenant has stopped and is watching Riker. For<br>
    a moment, he seems almost menacing. Then he walks off<br>
    down the hall...</p>
  <p> Riker stands there a moment... trying to shake the<br>
    creepy feeling... Then he ENTERS the Turbolift. As<br>
    the doors close...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes) </p>
  <p>4 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Riker and PICARD standing at the desk, looking at a<br>
    terminal.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Tilonus Four? Didn't their<br>
    government just collapse?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    It's in a state of total anarchy.<br>
    When the Prime Minister was<br>
    assassinated, a Federation<br>
    research team was on the planet.<br>
    It is believed they were forced to<br>
    go into hiding...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Your mission will be to locate and<br>
    evacuate them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Can't they go to local<br>
    authorities?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There are no local authorities.<br>
    The government's been splintered --<br>
    several factions are vying for<br>
    power. And they're desperate for<br>
    weapons or technology of any<br>
    kind...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Apparently, some factions are<br>
    resorting to torture to gather<br>
    information. A Starfleet research<br>
    team would be a prime target.</p>
  <p> Riker weighs the situation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then I'll have to go alone...<br>
    undercover.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed. Mister Worf is ready to<br>
    give you a detailed briefing on<br>
    Tilonian culture.</p>
  <p> Riker nods... and smiles, remembering something.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Looks like I'll have to back out<br>
    of Doctor Crusher's play after<br>
    all...</p>
  <p> Picard reacts, supportive.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, no... you'll have plenty of<br>
    time for that, Number One. We<br>
    won't be arriving at Tilonus for<br>
    another five days.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Besides, if you back out now,<br>
    Beverly will come after me to play<br>
    the part.</p>
  <p> Riker nods and they exchange a smile. As Riker<br>
    EXITS...</p>
  <p>5 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Later. Riker and WORF standing at the wall MONITOR,<br>
    which displays an AERIAL MAP of TILONUS FOUR. Worf<br>
    points to a specific region on the map.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    This is the last known location of<br>
    the research team. They had<br>
    occupied a small building in the<br>
    Southwest quarter of the city.<br>
    You will begin your search there.</p>
  <p> Riker considers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Southwest quarter covers over<br>
    two hundred square kilometers.<br>
    That's a lot of ground for one man<br>
    to cover...<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    I'd better pack an extra pair of<br>
    boots.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf shoots him a look, not in the mood for jokes. A<br>
    tense beat. Then he moves to the table, where SEVERAL<br>
    pieces of EQUIPMENT have been laid out -- a canteen,<br>
    some clothing, a tricorder, etc. Worf points to a<br>
    bundle of plain-looking CLOTHING.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (re: clothing)<br>
    This apparel will allow you to<br>
    pass as a common merchant.</p>
  <p> Worf picks up a small Tilonian PENDANT.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (re: pendant)<br>
    This Tilonian pendant has been<br>
    equipped with a communicator<br>
    circuit.</p>
  <p> Riker takes the pendant -- holds it up to the clothing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (with humor)<br>
    It doesn't really match the<br>
    outfit...</p>
  <p> Worf's temper flares.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I suggest you pay closer<br>
    attention, Commander. Your life<br>
    will be at stake.</p>
  <p> Worf stares intensely at Riker -- almost threatening.<br>
    It's a very odd moment -- strange and creepy.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (hard)<br>
    Do you understand what I am<br>
    saying?</p>
  <p> Riker is taken aback by Worf's tone.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (an edge)<br>
    Yes... of course I do...</p>
  <p> Worf picks up a small, exotic-looking KNIFE. Riker<br>
    observes somberly, his mood darker now.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (re: knife)<br>
    Because you will be posing as a<br>
    merchant, you will need to know<br>
    how to use the Nisroh for the<br>
    traditional bartering ceremony.</p>
  <p> Worf demonstrates by raising the blade high into the<br>
    air, moving it in a complex, ritualistic manner...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You will be judged on your prowess<br>
    with the blade...</p>
  <p> Worf moves the blade in quick thrusting motions...<br>
    faster.. more elaborate... Without warning, the blade<br>
    CATCHES THE SIDE OF RIKER'S HEAD. Riker recoils,<br>
    startled.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts, genuinely concerned.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am sorry, Commander! I did not<br>
    intend --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's okay, that's okay...</p>
  <p> Riker touches his head -- the wound is bleeding.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I guess I really wasn't paying<br>
    attention...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'd better get to Sickbay. We'll<br>
    pick this up later.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye sir...</p>
  <p> Worf watches with concern as Riker heads for the<br>
    door...</p>
  <p>6 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker sitting on a bed; Beverly HEALING his head wound<br>
    with a medical device.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (with humor)<br>
    You'll do anything to get out of<br>
    this play, won't you?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Well, you're going to have to do<br>
    better than this...</p>
  <p> Riker smiles.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The play's tomorrow night. I've<br>
    still got twenty-four hours left.</p>
  <p> Beverly shuts off the device. Riker turns -- his wound<br>
    is completely healed.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Don't get any ideas. I'll expect<br>
    you on stage at eighteen hundred<br>
    hours.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Right...</p>
  <p> Riker stands to go -- and stops, reacting to a sharp<br>
    pain in his head.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: his head)<br>
    It still hurts...</p>
  <p> Beverly quickly scans his head with a medical<br>
    tricorder.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There's no nerve damage... you<br>
    shouldn't be feeling any pain.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Probably just a symptom of stage<br>
    fright --</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the doors OPEN and GEORDI rushes in with TWO<br>
    N.D. CREWMEMBERS. One of the crewmembers is badly<br>
    INJURED -- his face and uniform are marred by scorch<br>
    marks and blood. Geordi and the other N.D. carry him<br>
    along, urgent...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> The crewmember screams in pain -- it's an awful sight.</p>
  <p> WOUNDED CREWMEMBER<br>
    It hurts! Oh God -- it hurts!</p>
  <p> The scene takes on a frantic, disturbing tone as they<br>
    help him toward a nearby bed...</p>
  <p> Riker moves out of the way. The wounded N.D. moans in<br>
    pain and looks directly at him. Riker reacts,<br>
    startled. The N.D. stares at Riker even as he is laid<br>
    on the bed... as Beverly begins to treat the wounds...<br>
    He just keeps staring... strange... unsettling...</p>
  <p> Riker edges toward the doors... unable to tear his eyes<br>
    away from the man... shaken by the sight... EXITS...</p>

  <p> Later. Riker and TROI sitting at the bar, drinks in<br>
    front of them. Riker is troubled by the day's events.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've been on a lot of missions...<br>
    and I've seen a lot of people get<br>
    injured...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I've never been affected like<br>
    this...</p>
  <p> Riker is chilled by the memory.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    He was looking right at me.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And that was disturbing to you...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It was like he was... blaming me<br>
    or something. But it's more than<br>
    just this one incident. For the<br>
    past few days, I've been feeling<br>
    like everyone's staring at me...<br>
    or talking about me...<br>

    I feel like I'm in &quot;Frame of<br>
    Mind&quot;...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    &quot;Frame of Mind&quot;?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Doctor Crusher's play. Ever since<br>
    I started rehearsing the role,<br>
    I've been feeling a little<br>
    restless... uneasy...</p>
  <p> Troi considers.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're probably drawing on<br>
    feelings that you're not used to<br>
    expressing...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yeah. The play is full of<br>
    disturbing images. People losing<br>
    their minds... being tortured by<br>
    doctors...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I can't get it out of my head...</p>
  <p> Troi is supportive, tries to help.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Sometimes it's healthy to explore<br>
    the darker sides of the psyche.<br>
    Jung called it &quot;owning your own<br>
    shadow.&quot;<br>
    (beat)<br>
    This could be a sign that you're<br>
    a real actor, Wil. It's becoming<br>
    more than just a role to you.</p>
  <p> Riker is intrigued by her words.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe you're right...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Don't be afraid of your darker<br>
    side. Have fun with it.</p>
  <p> Riker nods, feeling better. He lifts his glass to take<br>
    a drink, and stops -- reacting to a pain in his temple,<br>
    where the wound was. He puts his hand to his head, and<br>
    something across the room catches his eye...</p>

  <p>8 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> of the strange, alien Lieutenant (as seen in the<br>
    Teaser). He is sitting across the room, alone at a<br>
    table, staring at Riker with his expressionless face.<br>
    He stands and heads for the door...</p>
  <p>9 RESUME</p>
  <p> Riker turns to Troi.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: Lieutenant)<br>
    Who is that?</p>
  <p> Troi turns to look, but the doors are just closing.<br>
    The Lieutenant is gone.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You just missed him.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Do we have a new Lieutenant on<br>
    board?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm not sure. Do you want me to<br>
    check the personnel logs?</p>
  <p> Riker shakes off the creepy feeling, stands to go.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No... I'll check them tomorrow...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I think I'll get to bed early.<br>
    Tomorrow's the performance and I<br>

  <p> The austere set, as seen in the Teaser. But now there<br>
    is a full AUDIENCE -- Picard, Beverly, Worf, Troi,<br>
    Geordi and several other crewmembers and civilians are<br>
    watching, engrossed.</p>
  <p> The play is in its final moments. Riker is sitting on<br>
    the bed, strung-out. Data (as the Doctor) is standing<br>
    nearby. Riker's performance is different from before --<br>
    more focused and authentic. A genuine passion drives<br>
    him through the scene -- he is utterly convincing in<br>
    the role.</p>
  <p> DATA/DOCTOR<br>
    (doubtful)<br>
    Perhaps we should continue this<br>
    discussion next week...</p>
  <p> Riker stands, temper flaring.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No. I want to talk about it<br>
    now...</p>
  <p> DATA/DOCTOR<br>
    (calmly)<br>
    You're starting to sound angry<br>
    again. Maybe you need another<br>
    treatment...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What I need is to get out of this<br>
    cell. I'm locked up day and<br>
    night... you control every<br>
    move... tell me what to eat, what<br>
    to think, what to say...</p>
  <p> Riker moves around the room, liked a caged animal.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And when I show a glimmer of<br>
    independent thought, you strap me<br>
    down, inject me with drugs and<br>
    call it a &quot;treatment.&quot;</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    You're becoming agitated...</p>

  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker lets loose -- genuine emotions rushing to the<br>
    surface. He has no trouble with his final speech this<br>
    time around -- it's passionate and intense.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You bet I'm agitated! I may be<br>
    surrounded by insanity, but I'm<br>
    not insane. And I won't let you<br>
    or anyone else tell me I am.</p>
  <p> Riker prowls about the stage... hands shaking... voice<br>
    breaking with emotion. A believable, bravura<br>
    performance that has the audience riveted and moved.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You can destroy my mind, but you<br>
    can't change the truth. I didn't<br>
    kill that man.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And that's what's driving you<br>
    crazy...</p>
  <p> A long tense beat.</p>
  <p> DATA/DOCTOR<br>
    I can see we have a lot of work to<br>
    do.</p>
  <p> Data turns and EXITS. The sound of it being LOCKED.<br>
    Riker moves to the door and shouts at Data.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No matter what you do, you can't<br>
    change the fact that I'm innocent!<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm not crazy!</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the cell lights GO OUT and Riker sags against<br>
    the door, defeated.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    I'm not crazy...</p>
  <p> He pauses, staring into middle distance... suddenly<br>
    frozen with uncertainty... pondering the events that<br>
    have led to his imprisonment. The play has built to<br>
    this instant...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (doubtful)<br>
    I'm... not...<br>

  <p> The stage lights slowly FADE OUT. The End. A beat,<br>
    then the house lights COME UP. The audience begins to<br>
    APPLAUD enthusiastically. Several people stand... then<br>
    a few more... soon it is a standing ovation...</p>
  <p> The stage lights GO UP for the curtain call. Data<br>
    walks out and takes a bow. The applause intensifies.</p>
  <p> Riker walks onstage, out of breath... shaky... the<br>
    performance has taken its toll... but he smiles at the<br>
    audience and takes a bow...</p>
  <p>11 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> of the audience. Picard and the others can be seen<br>
    smiling, cheering...</p>

  <p>13 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> The alien Lieutenant is now standing next to Picard.<br>
    He is staring directly at Riker... eyes intense... face<br>
    cold... and he is not applauding...</p>
  <p>14 RIKER</p>
  <p> reacts to the sight, startled. He takes a final bow...</p>
  <p>15 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Riker stands. THE AUDIENCE IS GONE AND THERE IS A<br>
    CELL WALL IN ITS PLACE. The cheering has stopped --<br>

  <p> reacts and spins around --</p>
  <p>17 NEW ANGLE TO REVEAL:</p>
  <p> we are now in an ACTUAL ASYLUM CELL. Similar to the<br>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>19 INT. ASYLUM CELL - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Riker is glancing around the room, trying to make sense<br>
    out of the situation. He turns to the Doctor.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where am I?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    How did you get me off the ship?</p>
  <p> The Doctor studies him with concern... then taps a few<br>
    controls on a note-taking device.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    The ship again...</p>
  <p> Riker eyes him, confused. He moves to the door and<br>
    scans it -- but there's no visible way of getting it<br>
    open.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's going on?</p>
  <p> The Doctor tries to keep Riker calm by staying calm<br>
    himself. It's like he's been through this before.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    I understand this must be very<br>
    disturbing for you. But try to<br>
    relax.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Tell me. Where were you a moment<br>
    ago?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I was on the Enterprise. In the<br>
    middle of a play...<br>
    (looks around)<br>
    Here... but it wasn't real... it<br>
    was a stage...</p>

    I can assure you this is not a<br>
    stage.<br>

    about the room, grasping at the memories... but they're<br>
    quickly fading away...</p>

    (continuing)<br>
    I knew who I was a second ago...<br>
    I was on the ship... in a play...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It's getting harder to remember...</p>
  <p> The Doctor nods.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    That's good. You're starting to<br>
    come out of your delusional state.</p>

    you?</p>

    No...</p>

    That's right. Now. Focus on who<br>
    I am. Do you remember me?</p>

    I'm not sure...</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    I hurt my head... somebody hit<br>
    me...</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    You tried to escape. You<br>
    struggled with one of the<br>
    attendants and hit your head on a<br>
    door. Do you remember that?</p>
  <p> It finally starts to come back to Riker -- he remembers<br>
    what happened...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes... now I do. But at first, I<br>
    thought a Klingon cut me... with<br>
    a knife...</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    It's called transposition. You're<br>
    projecting elements from your<br>
    delusions onto events that really<br>
    happened.<br>

    If what you're saying is true...<br>
    where am I?</p>
  <p> The Doctor takes a beat.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    You're in Ward Forty-seven of the<br>
    Tilonus Institute for Mental<br>
    Disorders.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts. He sits down on the bed... weighing the<br>
    implications.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why am I here?</p>
  <p> The Doctor softens his tone.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    We'll talk more later. You don't<br>
    have to remember everything today.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You're making excellent progress.</p>
  <p> He gives Riker a gentle smile and a pat on the arm...<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Wait...</p>
  <p> Too late -- he EXITS and the door shuts with a<br>
    distinctive LOCKING NOISE. Riker moves to the small<br>
    window on the door and peers through it. The Doctor<br>
    disappears from view down an austere CORRIDOR.</p>
  <p> Riker stands there a moment... not sure what to do with<br>
    himself... then begins to take in the room. There's<br>
    not much to see. The walls and ceiling and floor are<br>
    blank. He presses his hands against the wall, as if to<br>
    test it. Solid.</p>
  <p> There is a small stainless steel MIRROR inset in a<br>
    wall. Riker moves to it and stares at his reflection.<br>
    At his clothing... his tired eyes... somber<br>
    expression...</p>

    (continuing)<br>
    Well?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to com)<br>
    I guess so...</p>
  <p> The door OPENS and an ATTENDANT (MAVEK) ENTERS along<br>
    with a HOSPITAL GUARD. The guard is holding a small<br>
    stun WEAPON.</p>
  <p> The Attendant offers Riker a smile.</p>
  <p> ATTENDANT<br>
    I hope you're hungry. They're<br>
    serving spiny lobe-fish today.</p>
  <p> The Guard moves behind Riker to escort him out of the<br>
    room. Riker is surprised by the high level of<br>
    security.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    There's no need for this.</p>

  <p> Riker, the Attendant and the Guard walking along. The<br>
    hall is ascetic, lined with CELL DOORS on either side,<br>
    each with an inset window pane. They pass another<br>
    inmate, who is being led along by an Attendant.<br>
    Somewhere in the distance, a brief YELL echoes through<br>
    the corridors. Riker takes it all in, unsettled by the<br>

  <p>23 INT. ASYLUM - COMMON AREA</p>
  <p> A large room that is brighter and more colorful than<br>
    the cell and the corridor. There are windows...<br>
    plants... several tables and activities for the<br>
    patients. One inmate is painting a bizarre PICTURE...<br>
    two other inmates are sitting together, engaged in a<br>
    hushed conversation... another sits alone, staring into<br>
    middle-distance, slowly rocking back and forth...</p>
  <p> Riker, the Attendant and the Guard ENTER. The<br>
    Attendant dismisses the Guard and leads Riker to a<br>
    table, sits him down.</p>
  <p> ATTENDANT<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    I'll be back with your lunch.</p>
  <p> The Attendant walks off. Riker glances around<br>
    nervously, uncomfortable in this strange setting. A<br>
    few moments go by... then a FEMALE INMATE -- alien,<br>
    humanoid -- sits down next to Riker and stares at him.<br>
    She glances around to make sure no one's listening...<br>
    speaks to him in an urgent whisper...</p>

    come in Yorktown. I've made<br>
    contact with another officer...</p>
  <p> Riker's realizes, his hopes dashed. From offscreen:</p>
  <p> ATTENDANT (O.S.)<br>
    Talking to your Starship again,<br>
    Jaya?</p>
  <p> She quickly hides the spoon.</p>

  <p> INMATE<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> She gets up and gives Riker a conspiratorial look --</p>
  <p> INMATE<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    Don't let them tell you you're<br>
    crazy.</p>
  <p> The Attendant sets down a plate of FOOD in front of<br>
    Riker, then moves to the inmate and stretches out his<br>
    hand.</p>
  <p> ATTENDANT<br>
    You know you're not supposed to<br>
    take utensils from the Common<br>
    Area.</p>
  <p> A beat. She grudgingly hands over the spoon and moves<br>
    off. The Attendant sits down and sets down the spoon<br>
    in front of Riker.</p>
  <p> ATTENDANT<br>
    (re: spoon)<br>
    You're welcome to try it.</p>
  <p> Riker manages a smile.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm not that far gone, am I?</p>
  <p> ATTENDANT<br>
    Of course you are. Last week you<br>
    held an entire conversation with<br>
    a chair, remember?</p>
  <p> Riker looks at him, surprised.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> A beat. The Attendant laughs. Riker realizes he was<br>
    joking and somberly looks down at his tray. There is<br>
    an underlying tension to the Attendant's friendly<br>
    demeanor -- he enjoys manipulating the patients to get<br>
    a reaction.</p>

    Where's your sense of humor? If<br>
    you ever want to get better,<br>
    you've got to relax.</p>
  <p> Riker takes a bite of food. A moment as he eats...<br>
    then he gazes at the Attendant, suddenly remembering<br>
    something...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Your name -- it's Mav... Mavek.</p>
  <p> ATTENDANT<br>
    That's right. Not bad for a crazy<br>
    man.</p>
  <p> Riker looks frustrated.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm starting to remember certain<br>
    things, but...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Why am I here?</p>
  <p> The Attendant considers... eyeing Riker...</p>
  <p> ATTENDANT<br>
    I remember when they brought you<br>
    in. You were screaming...<br>
    struggling...</p>
  <p> Riker listens intently, unsettled. The Attendant seems<br>
    to relish in the description...</p>
  <p> ATTENDANT<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We could barely hold you down. In<br>
    fact, just getting the blood off<br>
    your hands took over an hour.</p>

    You didn't just kill that man...<br>
    you mutilated him.</p>
  <p> Riker is shocked.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What are you talking about? I<br>
    didn't kill anybody.</p>
  <p> The Attendant is deliberately pushing Riker to get a<br>
    response.</p>
  <p> ATTENDANT<br>
    I'm afraid you did. You stabbed<br>
    him. They found you near the<br>
    body... with the knife in your<br>
    hand...</p>
  <p> Riker grows fearful... angry...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No. It's not true...</p>
  <p> ATTENDANT<br>
    Yes it is. And if you get out of<br>
    here, you're going to stand<br>
    trial...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (yells)<br>
    You're lying!</p>
  <p> ATTENDANT<br>
    I imagine the punishment will be<br>
    quite severe... considering you<br>
    stabbed him nine times --</p>
  <p> Riker loses control --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    NO!</p>
  <p> He stands, GRABS the Attendant and shoves him against<br>
    the wall. TWO GUARDS hurry over. They grab Riker by<br>
    the arms, restraining him. He struggles. The entire<br>
    room is watching.</p>
  <p> The Attendant pulls out an ALIEN SYRINGE from his coat --<br>
    moves toward Riker... As he INJECTS Riker with the<br>
    syringe --</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>27 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Riker is standing in the bathroom, dressed in his<br>
    INMATE COSTUME, looking in the mirror. He is preparing<br>
    himself for that evening's performance of the play.<br>
    Everything appears to be normal. Beverly stands<br>
    nearby, listening to Riker recall his &quot;dream.&quot;</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    I was there... in Ward Forty-seven,<br>
    just like in the play.<br>
    Everyone thought I was insane...<br>
    that I'd killed somebody...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Except it was all real.</p>
  <p> Beverly is fascinated.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Deanna mentioned you went to bed<br>
    early because you felt a little<br>
    anxious about the play. But I had<br>
    no idea...</p>
  <p> Riker picks up a small MAKE-UP STICK and begins to<br>
    apply dark make-up in circles around his eyes --<br>
    creating the subtle effect that he is exhausted.</p>
  <p> Beverly lightens the mood.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You said that in your dream we<br>
    performed the play...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    How'd it go?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It was a smash. We got a standing<br>
    ovation.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Let's hope it goes that well<br>
    tonight.</p>
  <p> Riker smiles. He finishes applying the make-up, sets<br>
    down the tube.</p>

    How do you feel?</p>
  <p> Riker smiles, confident.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I feel... like an actor.</p>
  <p> Beverly musses his hair a little for added effect.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're certainly starting to look<br>
    the part.</p>
  <p> They exchange a smile. Beverly EXITS. Riker stands to<br>
    take a final look at himself in the mirror...</p>
  <p> And stops at what he sees. The image is disquieting:<br>
    Riker the asylum inmate. There is a creepy moment as<br>
    he stares at himself... remembering the dream... then<br>
    he shakes off the feeling and turns away from the<br>
    mirror...</p>
  <p>28 INT. ASYLUM CELL/THEATER</p>
  <p> Mid-performance -- the same scene from Teaser and Act<br>
    One. There's a full AUDIENCE -- Picard, Beverly, Worf,<br>
    Troi, Geordi, etc. They are engrossed.</p>
  <p> Riker on his feet, haggard; Data the Doctor stands<br>
    nearby. Riker's performance is focused and intense.</p>
  <p> DATA/DOCTOR<br>
    (doubtful)<br>
    Perhaps we should continue this<br>
    discussion next week...</p>
  <p> Riker's temper flares.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No. I want to talk about it<br>
    now...</p>

    You're starting to sound angry<br>
    again. Maybe you need another<br>
    treatment...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What I need is to get out of this<br>
    cell. I'm locked up day and<br>
    night... you control my every<br>
    move...</p>
  <p> At that instant, Riker something catches Riker's eye.<br>
    he looks toward the door. A face is staring in through<br>
    the small window. Riker reacts, surprised -- it's not<br>
    part of the play.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (distracted)<br>
    You tell me what to eat... what to<br>
    think... what to say...</p>
  <p> The cell door starts to OPEN. Riker watches as Mavek<br>
    the Attendant -- as seen in the &quot;dream&quot; -- walks onto<br>
    the stage. He shuts the door and stands there,<br>
    silently watching him.</p>
  <p> Riker is stunned -- what's happening? He looks to<br>
    Beverly, who sits in the wings...</p>
  <p>29 BEVERLY</p>
  <p> reacts, thinking Riker has forgotten his dialogue. She<br>
    picks up a PADD and feeds him his next line --</p>

    &quot;And when I show a glimmer of<br>
    independent thought... &quot;</p>
  <p>30 RIKER</p>
  <p> looks back toward Mavek -- he is gone. Riker<br>
    hesitates, unsettled... but his instincts quickly kick<br>
    in and he continues...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And when I show a glimmer of<br>
    independent thought, you strap me<br>
    down, inject me with drugs and<br>
    call it a &quot;treatment.&quot;</p>

  <p> DATA/DOCTOR<br>
    You're becoming agitated...</p>
  <p> Riker gets back into the scene... genuinely agitated<br>
    now... and it fuels his performance...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You bet I'm agitated! I may be<br>
    surrounded by insanity, but I'm<br>
    not insane. And I won't let you<br>
    or anyone else tell me...</p>
  <p> Something catches Riker's eye -- he glances toward the<br>
    audience to see:</p>
  <p>31 RIKER'S POV</p>
  <p> THE AUDIENCE IS GONE. In its place is an ASYLUM CELL<br>
    WALL.</p>
  <p>32 RIKER</p>
  <p> can't believe his eyes. He looks to Data, who stares<br>
    back at him as if nothing is wrong.</p>
  <p> Riker looks back toward the wall -- it's gone and the<br>
    audience has returned.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    What's happening...</p>
  <p> An awkward beat. The scene has stalled. Data,<br>
    thinking fast, jumps to his next line of dialogue to<br>
    keep things moving.</p>
  <p> DATA/DOCTOR<br>
    I can see we have a lot of work to<br>
    do.</p>
  <p> Data EXITS. Riker is truly shaken, continuing the<br>
    scene out of desperation if nothing else.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No matter what you do, you can't<br>
    change the fact that I'm<br>
    innocent...</p>
  <p> Riker sees something in the audience --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>33 RIKER'S POV</p>
  <p> In the audience, sitting next to Picard, is the alien<br>
    Lieutenant. He stares at Riker, expressionless.</p>
  <p>34 RIKER</p>
  <p> is at the breaking point. He stares at the Lieutenant,<br>
    growing angry.</p>
  <p> Data is unsure what to do. Beverly looks alarmed.<br>
    Riker calls out --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Lieutenant)<br>
    You're the key to all this, aren't<br>
    you? Who are you?</p>
  <p> Riker forgets the play and walks offstage... directly<br>
    into the audience... straight toward the alien<br>
    Lieutenant. People react, surprised, and get out the<br>
    way. Riker GRABS the Lieutenant by the uniform.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Who are you?</p>
  <p> The Lieutenant looks confused.</p>
  <p> LIEUTENANT<br>
    Lieutenant Suna, sir...</p>
  <p> The Lieutenant is clearly terrified. Riker realizes...<br>
    and gradually lets him go... looks around the room to<br>
    see that everyone is staring at him.</p>
  <p> There is a long, awkward silence. Beverly walks up to<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Wil... are you alright?</p>
  <p> Riker is confused.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No... I don't know...</p>
  <p> She gently takes him by the arm.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Why don't we go down to Sickbay...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - ACT THREE 37.</p>

  <p> Riker nods. Everyone watches with concern as Beverly<br>
    leads him toward the door...</p>
  <p>35 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Later. Riker sitting on a bio-bed; Beverly scanning<br>
    him with a medical tricorder.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    There's nothing wrong with you<br>
    neurologically. I don't see<br>
    anything that could've caused your<br>
    hallucinations.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But your heart rate is up... blood<br>
    pressure's way above normal.<br>
    You're physically exhausted.</p>
  <p> Riker is on edge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is more than just fatigue...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's possible under conditions of<br>
    extreme stress for the mind to<br>
    manufacture all kinds of things.</p>
  <p> Riker thinks -- remembers something.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Drugs. They injected me with me<br>
    drugs...<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    Are there drugs in my system?</p>
  <p> Beverly scans him with the tricorder just to be sure.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    Nothing.</p>
  <p> Riker lets out a long breath.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's that dream... they gave me<br>
    drugs in the dream...<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No... nobody.</p>
  <p> Riker looks uneasy. Beverly tries to comfort him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Get some rest, Wil. The play is<br>
    over. Don't give it another<br>
    thought.</p>
  <p> Riker nods, starting to feel normal again.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    him go, concerned...</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    A little shaken... but alright.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I feel like such an idiot.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's nothing to be embarrassed<br>
    about. We're your friends... We<br>
    all know the stress you've been<br>
    under. I'm sure everyone<br>
    understands perfectly...</p>
  <p> They reach an intersection and run into Data, who is<br>
    back in uniform. A moment as they stop.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Oh?</p>

    improvise was an effective method<br>
    of drawing the audience into the<br>
    plight of your character.<br>

    You gave a truly realistic<br>
    interpretation of multi-infarct<br>

  <p> as he smiles -- feeling better. HOLD on Riker as he<br>
    continues walking with Troi (who is now offscreen).</p>

    I guess all I need is a little<br>
    rest... clear my mind a little...</p>

    I want you to try a few relaxation<br>
    techniques, as well. Remember the<br>

    Yeah... but they didn't seem to<br>

    (quietly)<br>
    It's not real... not real...</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    I need help. I don't want to be<br>
    at the mercy of these<br>
    hallucinations any more.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    So you've accepted that you're not<br>

  <p> Riker nods.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    fades away... like a dream...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But the hospital... everything<br>
    here seems real. I can always<br>
    remember what happens here...</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    And what about how you got here?</p>
  <p> Riker takes a deep breath... nods.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe I did kill someone. I don't<br>
    know. But I want to find out.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    I'm glad to hear you say that.<br>
    Because I just had a long talk<br>
    with the hospital Administrator.<br>
    He told me there are certain legal<br>
    questions that have to be resolved<br>
    relatively soon.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Meaning?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    Meaning we can't keep you here<br>
    much longer. We're the only<br>
    mental health facility on Tilonus<br>
    Four. There are many people who<br>
    need our help...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I don't want to put any undue<br>
    stress on you... but we have to<br>
    settle this case one way or<br>
    another within the next few days.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What does that mean?</p>
  <p> The Doctor takes a beat.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    You're facing a choice. We can<br>
    try to help you remember what<br>
    happened using Reflection Therapy.<br>
    If it's successful, you would be<br>
    fit to stand trial.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Reflection Therapy?</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    It's a way for you to interact<br>
    with various facets of your<br>
    personality. We scan the regions<br>
    of your brain that control<br>
    emotions and memory... then<br>
    project them holographically.</p>
  <p> Riker considers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's the other option?</p>
  <p> The Doctor finds the best way to put this.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    A complete synaptic reconstruction<br>
    of your cerebral cortex.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Surgery?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> The Doctor nods grimly.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    We would neutralize the synaptic<br>
    pathways responsible for your<br>
    mental instability.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You don't seem to like that<br>
    option.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    I don't. The procedure is<br>
    irreversible. You'd be left with<br>
    a completely altered personality.<br>
    The person you are now would cease<br>
    to exist.</p>
  <p> Riker doesn't like the sound of it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Option one is starting to sound<br>
    better...</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    I agree.</p>
  <p> A beat as Riker makes the choice.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Reflection Therapy then... when do<br>
    we start?</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    This afternoon, if you're ready.<br>
    I want you to understand this<br>
    isn't going to be easy. You'll be<br>
    interacting with aspects of your<br>
    psyche that you've never dealt<br>
    with before.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And you may be disturbed by what<br>
    they have to say.</p>
  <p> Riker nods, understanding what he's about to face. OFF<br>
    his apprehension...</p>
  <p>47 INT. ASYLUM CELL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker is sitting on the bed, watching Doctor Syrus, who<br>
    is placing a MEDICAL DEVICE on the floor. The device<br>
    is a tall, sleek cylinder with several controls on the<br>
    side.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - ACT FOUR 46A.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The Doctor ACTIVATES the device and it sends out a low<br>
    HUMMING NOISE.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Close your eyes. Try to relax.<br>
    Clear your mind.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Riker shuts his eyes. The Doctor hits a control on the<br>
    device -- it SENDS OUT a THIN BEAM OF LIGHT that<br>
    briefly PLAYS ACROSS Riker's forehead in a scanning<br>
    pattern.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    Now. Think back to before you<br>
    came to the hospital. But don't<br>
    try to remember specific<br>
    incidents. Concentrate on how you<br>
    felt...</p>
  <p> Riker thinks.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I was... afraid...</p>
  <p> From offscreen:</p>
  <p> TROI (O.S.)<br>
    Terrified...</p>
  <p>48 INCLUDE TROI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> who is standing in the room -- a holographic image.<br>
    Riker reacts.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: Troi)<br>
    She was on the ship with me...</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    That's because she represents an<br>
    aspect of your personality -- and<br>
    there are many parts of you that<br>
    still believe you're on that<br>
    starship.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why her?</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    I asked you to get in touch with<br>
    your feelings, and this is the<br>
    part of you that responded. Talk<br>
    to her about how you felt before<br>
    you came here...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - ACT FOUR 48.</p>
  <p>48 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker walks over to the Troi image, eyes her.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    You said I was terrified... of<br>
    what?</p>
  <p> Troi looks at Riker.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I was in a dark place... cold...<br>
    frightened... someone was there...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Who?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I felt threatened by them...<br>
    trapped...</p>
  <p> The Doctor leads him through the process.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    You're doing very well. Let's try<br>
    to find out how you responded to<br>
    these feelings. Try to focus on<br>
    your actions...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You felt trapped. What did you<br>
    do?</p>
  <p> Riker thinks. Worf APPEARS in the room. He seems<br>
    furious -- at a high emotional pitch.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I was angry. They were attacking<br>
    me... I fought back...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I felt pain...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I was injured...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I began to panic...</p>

    There was a struggle... and I...</p>
  <p> Worf trails off.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You what? What happened?</p>
  <p> Worf and Troi are silent -- they don't have an answer.<br>
    Riker looks to the Doctor, agitated.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Try to associate your actions and<br>
    emotions with logical thoughts.<br>
    What do you think caused you to<br>
    act and feel this way... ?</p>
  <p> Riker concentrates. Picard APPEARS in the room. He is<br>
    thoughtful, assured.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It was dark and cold because... I<br>
    was outdoors... at night... in a<br>
    narrow space...<br>
    (thinks)<br>
    I was walking through an alley.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I felt threatened...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I was being watched...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Someone must have followed me into<br>
    the alley. That's why I started<br>
    to walk faster. Then someone<br>
    grabbed me from behind...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I panicked...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I tried to fight them off...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How many of them were there?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Three. They were humanoid. I<br>
    could only make out one of their<br>
    faces...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Who was it?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - ACT FOUR 49A.</p>
  <p>48 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the alien Lieutenant APPEARS. He stands<br>
    silently, staring at Riker. Riker is surprised by the<br>
    sight.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: Lieutenant)<br>
    He was on the ship too... and I<br>
    saw him here in the hospital...<br>
    but I don't know who he is...</p>
  <p> The Doctor looks curious.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    That's Mister Suna -- the hospital<br>
    Administrator. You met him when<br>
    you first arrived.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What part of me does he represent?</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    I don't know...</p>
  <p> Suddenly, Picard and Worf all turn to Riker. Their<br>
    demeanors change -- they sound and act just like<br>
    themselves. It's an eerie moment...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Don't believe this, Wil.<br>
    (indicates room)<br>
    None of it is real. You're still<br>
    with us... on the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Riker is worried by this change in attitude.</p>

    Doctor...</p>

    We're your colleagues. Trust us.<br>
    It's going to be alright...</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Do you have anything to say to<br>
    them?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to crew)<br>
    You're just... delusions...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (re: Doctor)<br>
    Do not listen to him, Commander.<br>
    He is trying to trick you. You<br>
    are in danger here. Let us help<br>
    you...</p>
  <p> Riker's mind is reeling -- he's trying desperately to<br>
    hang on to what he believes to be the here and now.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Stop it... please. Leave me<br>
    alone...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Listen to me, Wil. In all the<br>
    years we've known each other, have<br>
    I ever lied to you?</p>
  <p> Riker glances between Troi and the Doctor, who is<br>
    waiting to see what he will do. Finally --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (a shout)<br>
    You are not real!</p>

    Wil, please --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    NO!</p>
  <p> Picard, Troi, Worf and the alien Lieutenant VANISH.<br>
    Riker sags into his chair, exhausted. The Doctor looks<br>
    pleased.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    You've taken a big step today.<br>
    You've finally turned your back on<br>
    those delusions and all that they<br>

    silently, staring...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>49 INT. COMMON AREA</p>
  <p> The next day. Various inmates engaged in various<br>
    activities. Riker sits alone at a table, eating food<br>
    from a tray. A silent moment as he eats, then<br>
    something across the room catches his eye...</p>
  <p>50 INCLUDE BEVERLY</p>
  <p> as she ENTERS the room. She is dressed in a hospital<br>
    doctor's uniform and holds a note-taking device. Very<br>
    official. She scans the room a moment, then spots<br>
    Riker --</p>
  <p> Riker reacts, unnerved by the sight. Beverly starts to<br>
    approach him. He quickly shuts his eyes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    It's not real...</p>
  <p> He opens his eyes -- Beverly is sitting down at his<br>
    table. Riker looks down at his food and continues<br>
    eating, desperately trying to ignore her presence.<br>
    Beverly studies him, gauging his condition -- speaks in<br>
    an urgent whisper.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Commander... do you know who I am?</p>
  <p> Riker doesn't respond -- keeps eating.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Do you know where you are?<br>
    (no response)<br>
    If you can't answer, just listen.<br>
    You were on an undercover mission<br>
    to Tilonus Four... something<br>
    happened... we've been told that<br>
    you killed someone. But we don't<br>
    believe that's true...</p>

    We've been in orbit, trying to<br>

    there's a security field around<br>
    the hospital that we can't<br>
    penetrate...</p>
  <p> Riker eats faster, agitated, trying not to listen --<br>
    it's a struggle.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We've been blocked at every turn.<br>
    The hospital Administrator denies<br>
    you're here at all. It's<br>
    beginning to look like some kind<br>
    of a conspiracy...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I had to come in posing as a<br>

    Sit tight. We're going to get you<br>

  <p> Later. The room is dark. Riker is lying in bed, eyes<br>
    closed, asleep. Gradually, a TAPPING NOISE can be<br>
    heard somewhere in the darkness. Riker opens his<br>
    eyes... listens a moment... then looks toward the<br>
    door...</p>
  <p> Someone is trying to break in. Riker sits up, alarmed.<br>
    The tapping noise is followed by a CLACK and other<br>
    tampering sounds. Riker watches as the door starts to<br>
    OPEN -- slowly, as if someone is forcing it. Two hands<br>
    can be seen pulling the door apart...</p>

  <p> Data gets the door all the way open and ENTERS the<br>

    scan the room, then spot Riker on the bed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    Commander.</p>
  <p> They move to help him, but Riker jumps off the bed and<br>
    backs against a wall -- can hardly believe his eyes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Get away from me...</p>
  <p> Data and Worf exchange a concerned look. Worf takes a<br>
    step toward Riker, speaks very carefully.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Commander, you must come with us.<br>
    You are in danger here...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    No.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Silence...</p>
  <p> Riker starts to say something, but Data quickly moves<br>
    in and GRABS him -- puts a hand over his mouth. Riker<br>
    struggles, to little effect. They lead him toward the<br>
    door...</p>

  <p> Worf ENTERS the hall, looks around -- it's empty. Data<br>
    ENTERS holding Riker tightly by the arm. They quickly<br>
    move down the hall, Worf leading the way, keeping a<br>
    look-out...</p>
  <p> Suddenly, Riker goes limp in Data's arms. Data looks<br>
    down at him, loosening his grip a little, concerned.</p>

    Help me! HELP ME!</p>
  <p> Worf goes to grab him. Mavek the Attendant and a<br>
    hospital Guard round a corner. The Guard immediately<br>
    draws his weapon, getting the drop on Worf, who stops.<br>
    Riker runs to the safety of the guards -- he looks like<br>
    he's coming unhinged.</p>

  <p> Worf just glares at him.</p>

    (to Guard)<br>
    Take them to Security Ward.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, Data moves for the Guard, disarms the man and<br>
    easily KNOCKS him to the floor. Worf takes out Mavek<br>
    with a single well-timed PUNCH.</p>
  <p> Riker makes a run for it, but Data GRABS him firmly by<br>
    the arms. As they lead Riker down the hall...</p>
  <p>54 INT. COMMON AREA - NIGHT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> After hours -- dark. Worf, Data and Riker ENTER and<br>
    cross to the middle of the room, where THREE PATTERN<br>
    ENHANCER DEVICES have been set up (as seen in &quot;Power<br>
    Play&quot;). Worf activates one of the enhancers and they<br>
    create a TRIANGLE OF LIGHT. Worf pulls out a<br>
    communicator.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

    Worf to Enterprise -- the pattern<br>

  <p>55 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker sits on a bio-bed, silent, guarded, wary of<br>
    everything and everyone around him. He still does not<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    You were abducted during your<br>
    mission to Tilonus Four. You were<br>
    taken to a psychiatric hospital...</p>
  <p> Riker glances at him, compelled by the words but not<br>
    wanting to believe it. Suddenly, he reacts to a pain<br>
    in the side of his head -- and we see that there is a<br>
    WOUND on his temple (as seen in Act One). It's<br>
    bleeding. Riker touches it, looks at the blood on his<br>
    hand.</p>

  <p> Beverly eyes the wound, picks up a medical device.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's minor. Nothing to worry<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's right. It appears he's<br>

    It still hurts...</p>
  <p> A drip of blood trails down the side of his face.<br>
    Riker reacts -- touches his face: THE WOUND HAS<br>
    REAPPEARED. He reacts, startled -- how could that be?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's bleeding again...<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    But how? You just healed it...</p>
  <p> Beverly eyes him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Wil, try to calm down...</p>
  <p> Riker comes to a realization -- and a look of resolve<br>
    crosses his face.</p>

  <p>55 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This isn't real...</p>
  <p> With that, he lunges for a nearby MEDICAL KIT. Worf<br>
    tries to stop him but Riker SMASHES the kit against the<br>
    side of Worf's head. Worf staggers back, and he as he<br>
    does, Riker grabs his phaser. Picard makes a move but<br>
    stops when Riker trains the phaser on him.</p>
  <p> Nobody moves.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wil, what are you doing?</p>
  <p> Riker's hands are shaking -- he's determined to shatter<br>
    this reality.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If I'm right, you're not really<br>
    here... and this isn't a real<br>
    phaser...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It's all a fantasy, and I'm ending<br>
    it no matter what it takes...</p>
  <p> Picard takes a step toward him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But what if this isn't a fantasy?<br>
    Are you willing to take that<br>
    chance?</p>
  <p> Riker hesitates, lowers the phaser slightly...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're right... I won't. But I've<br>
    got to find out what's real and<br>
    what's not...</p>
  <p> Riker turns the phaser on himself.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    One way or another, this is going<br>
    to end.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Wil, don't -- !</p>
  <p> Riker FIRES. The blast has no effect on him -- at that<br>
    instant:</p>

    RIKER -- &quot;REALITY&quot; BREAKING APART -- THE SCENE<br>
    SPLINTERING AWAY TO REVEAL:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - REV. 02/17/93 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>57 INT. ASYLUM CELL - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker standing in the exact same position, arms hanging<br>
    at his side -- his head wound is gone. The alien<br>
    Lieutenant is standing in front of him, dressed as the<br>
    hospital Administrator (as seen in Act Two). Doctor<br>
    Syrus and Mavek stand nearby. Riker glances around,<br>
    startled by the change in setting.</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    (re: Riker)<br>
    How's he progressing?</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    He's not responding to the<br>
    Reflection Therapy. His delusions<br>
    are growing more elaborate...</p>
  <p> ATTENDANT<br>
    He broke out of his cell last<br>
    night. We found him running down<br>
    a corridor... claiming people had<br>
    come to take him back to his<br>
    &quot;starship.&quot;</p>
  <p> A grim beat.</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    Then I see no other choice...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We'll have to perform the synaptic<br>
    reconstruction.</p>
  <p> Riker senses something odd -- looks down at his hand.<br>
    HE IS STILL HOLDING THE PHASER. He reacts, startled --<br>
    aims the phaser at the others.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I still have the phaser... why do<br>
    I still have the phaser?</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    It's not a phaser. It's a knife.<br>
    You stole it from one of the food<br>
    trays.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Give it to me. We don't want you<br>
    to hurt yourself...</p>
  <p> Riker hesitates, unsure, then --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>57A NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As a trickle of blood runs down Riker's face -- THE<br>
    WOUND HAS REAPPEARED ON HIS TEMPLE. Riker touches the<br>
    wound, and it shocks him into awareness. He aims the<br>
    phaser at the Attendant.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't believe you --</p>
  <p> Riker FIRES, VAPORIZING the Attendant. The Doctor and<br>
    the Administrator/Lieutenant react, shocked. Riker<br>
    smiles -- he's feeling more confident...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: phaser)<br>
    If this is a knife... what<br>
    happened to Mavek?</p>
  <p> The Administrator/Lieutenant tries to stay in control<br>
    of the situation.</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    It's very complicated. I'll<br>
    answer all of your questions. But<br>
    first I want you to put it down...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No. If I'm really holding a<br>
    phaser, then that means I was on<br>
    the Enterprise...</p>
  <p> He realizes the implications, stares at the phaser.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But I fired this at myself on the<br>
    Enterprise. I should be dead<br>
    right now...</p>
  <p> Riker looks around the room, trying to put it all<br>
    together.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    None of this is real --</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm setting this to Level Sixteen,<br>
    wide field. That should destroy<br>
    half of this building...<br>

    Unless, of course, it isn't a real<br>

  <p> Riker FIRES an IMMENSE BLAST --</p>

  <p> Riker (wound gone) and the Administrator/Lieutenant now<br>
    standing face to face on the stage set. Riker looks<br>
    around --</p>
  <p>62 INCLUDE - THE AUDIENCE</p>
  <p> Filled with people: Picard, Data, Worf, Geordi,<br>
    Beverly, Troi -- the entire Enterprise crew, and more:<br>
    Doctor Syrus, Mavek. Nearly everyone Riker saw during<br>
    the last five Acts is present, watching the stage<br>
    intently.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>62 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker is more confused than ever, but he's determined<br>
    to get to the bottom of this. He turns to the<br>
    Administrator/Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's all about you, isn't it?<br>
    You're the only constant... the<br>
    only person in both places...</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    There's a lot more going on here<br>
    than you realize.</p>
  <p> Riker glances toward the audience.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    None of this is real, either...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    What's happening to me?</p>
  <p> The administrator/Lieutenant steps toward him.</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    We can still save you -- but you<br>
    must stop fighting us.</p>
  <p> Riker hesitates, unsure for a moment -- then he reacts<br>
    to a pain in the side of his head.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/16/93 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>62A NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as a trickle of blood runs down the side of his face.<br>
    THE WOUND HAS REAPPEARED. Riker reacts, touches the<br>
    wound. It seems to jolt him into awareness. He looks<br>
    up, defiant.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're lying...</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    Let me help you...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (yells)<br>
    No!</p>
  <p> The audience reacts with a smattering of APPLAUSE.<br>
    Riker glances at them, encouraged.</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    I'm warning you...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No!</p>
  <p> Riker loses control -- he SHOVES the<br>
    Administrator/Lieutenant aside and heads for the back<br>
    wall of the stage set. The audience CHEERS and starts<br>
    to get to its feet. Determined to break out of this<br>
    reality, driven by the applause, Riker PUNCHES both<br>
    fists toward the back wall --</p>
  <p>62B NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> AS EVERYTHING SHATTERS LIKE BREAKING GLASS, INCLUDING<br>
    RIKER AND THE ADMINISTRATOR/LIEUTENANT -- &quot;REALITY&quot;<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Frame of Mind&quot; - 02/17/93 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>63 INT. ALIEN LAB</p>
  <p> Riker bolts awake. He looks around, sees that he is<br>
    lying on an EXAMINATION TABLE. An alien MEDICAL<br>
    APPARATUS is above him -- a PROBE is connected to the<br>
    side of his head at the exact spot where the wound has<br>
    appeared all along. He is dressed in the Tilonus<br>
    merchant costume seen in Act One. He turns to see:</p>
  <p>64 INCLUDE - THE ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> It's a redress of the Asylum Cell -- rigged with<br>
    various alien medical equipment. The<br>
    Administrator/Lieutenant is working at a console that<br>
    displays a GRAPHIC of a HUMAN BRAIN. The mood is<br>
    different here -- THIS IS REALITY.</p>
  <p> The Administrator/Lieutenant turns, sees that Riker is<br>
    awake, yells to someone offscreen:</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    He's conscious!</p>
  <p> The Administrator/Lieutenant rushes to Riker and tries<br>
    to pin him down. Riker struggles. An ALIEN ASSISTANT<br>
    moves into view.</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    (to assistant)<br>
    We haven't finished the neuro<br>
    chemical drain -- get him sedated!</p>
  <p> The Assistant moves for him -- but Riker KICKS him<br>
    squarely in the head, knocking him unconscious and to<br>
    the floor. Riker tears the probe away from his head,<br>
    revealing a nasty-looking wound -- blood trails down<br>
    his face. He quickly scans the room -- spots a nearby<br>
    table --</p>
  <p> INCLUDE the table, which contains the tricorder, water<br>
    bottle, nisroh knife and the pendant/communicator seen<br>
    in Act One. Before the Administrator can stop him,<br>
    Riker grabs the knife and turns it on the Administrator --<br>
    holds it close to his neck, threatening. The<br>
    Administrator stops. Riker grabs the pendant --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (taps pendant)<br>
    Riker to Enterprise!</p>

    Commander Riker has returned<br>
    safely from his mission to Tilonus<br>
    Four, where he was being held<br>
    captive by one of the rival<br>
    factions. Doctor Crusher has<br>
    repaired the damage to his long<br>
    term memory. His recovery is<br>
    proceeding well.</p>
  <p>65A INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> A couple of days have passed. Riker looks rested and<br>
    in good health. He's sitting with Picard and Troi, midconversation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Evidently, you were abducted two<br>
    days after beaming to the surface.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I remember it now... I was in an<br>
    alley... they attacked me from<br>
    behind. I tried to defend myself<br>
    with the nisroh knife Worf gave<br>
    me...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I managed to fight off one of<br>
    them... but I think they injected<br>
    me with some kind of drug...</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    We believe they were trying to<br>
    extract strategic information from<br>
    your memory using a neuro-somatic<br>
    technique.</p>
  <p> Riker considers, disturbed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I was in a hospital... then on the<br>
    Enterprise... and the hospital<br>
    again...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I kept shifting back and forth...<br>
    I couldn't tell what was real...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Your mind must have created a<br>
    defense mechanism, a fantasy that<br>
    helped you resist the neuro-somatic<br>
    process. Your unconscious<br>
    fastened onto elements from your<br>
    real life in an attempt to keep<br>
    you grounded... to keep you sane.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (onto the idea)<br>
    The preparation for the mission...<br>
    the play... they were all recent<br>
    experiences, fresh in my mind...</p>
  <p> Troi nods. A thoughtful beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Get some rest, Number One. We can<br>
    talk more in the morning.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Alright... but there's one thing<br>
    I'd like to do first...</p>

  <p> Riker and Beverly standing on the stage set. They are<br>
    alone. Riker is eyeing the stage intently.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Are you sure you want to do this<br>
    by yourself? The stage crew and<br>
    I were going to wait until<br>
    morning...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm positive. After what I've<br>
    experienced... I don't think I<br>
    could sleep knowing this was still<br>
    up...</p>
  <p> Riker moves to a stage wall and removes a piece of the<br>
    set, starting to break it down. He drops the piece to<br>
    the floor, satisfied. Beverly smiles gently and EXITS.<br>
    Riker considers the stage for a long beat... reflecting<br>
    on his experience... then continues to break it down.<br>
    As he works...</p>
