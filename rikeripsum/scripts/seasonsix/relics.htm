    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is moving at warp speed.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> DATA is working at the aft science station. PICARD and<br>
    RIKER are standing nearby, WORF is at Tactical, and<br>
    ENSIGN RAGER is at Con. The monitor at the science<br>
    station shows an Okudagram of a subspace radio wave.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (working)<br>
    I have identified the signal,<br>
    Captain. It is from the U.S.S.<br>
    Jenolan, a Federation transport<br>
    ship reported missing in this<br>
    sector seventy-five years ago.</p>
  <p> Riker looks at the monitor.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Code one alpha zero. Ship in<br>
    distress.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - REV. 8/6/92 - TEASER 2-2A. </p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Rager)<br>
    Bring us out of warp, Ensign.<br>
    All stop.</p>
  <p> RAGER<br>
    (works)<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> The ship is suddenly ROCKED and the alert status goes<br>
    to YELLOW. Picard, Riker, &amp; Data move toward their<br>
    stations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Report.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We have entered a massive<br>
    gravitational field.</p>
  <p> They all react with surprise.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (works)<br>
    There are no stars or other<br>
    stellar bodies listed on our<br>
    navigational charts. However,<br>
    sensors indicate the presence of<br>
    an extremely strong gravitational<br>
    source in this vicinity.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Can you localize the source of<br>
    the gravity field?</p>
  <p> Worf works his console.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - REV. 8/5/92 - TEASER 3-3A. </p>
  <p>3 INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The viewer displays a starfield with a large dark ball<br>
    at the center. At this distance, it appears as smooth<br>
    as a billiard ball, but because it is so dark it's hard<br>
    to discern anything else.</p>
  <p> Everyone is mystified by this strange object.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sensors?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am having difficulty scanning<br>
    the object. However, it would<br>
    appear to be approximately two<br>
    hundred million kilometers in<br>
    diameter.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker react with astonishment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's nearly the size of Earth's<br>
    orbit around the sun.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why didn't we detect it before<br>
    now?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The object's enormous mass is<br>
    causing a great deal of<br>
    gravimetric interference. That<br>
    might have prevented our sensors<br>
    from detecting the object before<br>
    we dropped out of warp.</p>
  <p> A beat as they all look at this strange object on the<br>
    screen. Suddenly, a look of wonder comes across<br>
    Picard's face... he might have found something hitherto<br>
    only imagined.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, could this be a...<br>
    Dyson Sphere?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (thinks)<br>
    This object does fit the general<br>
    parameters of Dyson's theory.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A Dyson Sphere?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - 8/4/92 - TEASER 3A.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (thinks)<br>
    There is no comparative data,<br>
    Captain. However, this object<br>
    does fit the general parameters<br>
    of Dyson's theory.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A Dyson Sphere?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - REV. 8/6/92 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's a very old theory, Number<br>
    One. I'm not surprised you<br>
    haven't heard of it. A twentieth<br>
    century physicist, Freeman Dyson,<br>
    postulated that an enormous hollow<br>
    sphere could be constructed around<br>
    a star. This would have the<br>
    advantage of harnessing all the<br>
    radiant energy of the star. A<br>
    population living on the interior<br>
    surface would therefore have a<br>
    virtually inexhaustible source<br>
    of power.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you saying there might be<br>
    people living in there?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Possibly a great number of people,<br>
    Commander. The interior surface<br>
    area of a sphere this size would<br>
    be equivalent to more than two<br>
    hundred fifty million class M<br>
    planets.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir. I have located the distress<br>
    signal. It is coming from a point<br>
    on the northern hemisphere.</p>
  <p> Picard thinks for a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign Rager, take us into<br>
    synchronous orbit above that<br>
    position.</p>
  <p> Rager works.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>4 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE &amp; SPHERE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is nearing the Sphere. At this range, the<br>
    monstrous object looks like a giant WALL in space,<br>
    which stretches o.c. Where before, the sphere appeared<br>
    perfectly smooth, we can now make out intricate<br>
    patterns on the surface suggesting construction<br>
    supports, but again we're too far away to make out<br>
    anything distinct.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - REV. 8/6/92 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>5 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As before. Everyone watching the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> RAGER<br>
    We are holding relative position<br>
    at thirty thousand kilometers<br>
    above the surface.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    I have found the Jenolan,<br>
    Captain. It has impacted on the<br>
    surface of the sphere.<br>
    (works)<br>
    There are no life signs.<br>
    However, there are several small<br>
    power emanations... and life<br>
    support is still functioning at<br>
    minimal levels.</p>
  <p> Riker looks to Picard, who thinks for a moment... then<br>
    nods.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Bridge to Engineering. Geordi,<br>
    meet me in Transporter Room Three.<br>
    (to Worf, on the move)<br>
    Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> Worf and Riker EXIT.</p>
  <p>5A EXT. SPACE - THE JENOLAN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The transport ship has made a crash landing on the<br>
    surface of the sphere. There should be some damage<br>
    visible, but not so much that the ship would be<br>
    incapable of later flight.</p>
  <p>6 INT. JENOLAN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Ops center is fairly small with a modest command<br>
    area at one end and an engineering console at the<br>
    opposite end. Off to one side is a two-man Transporter<br>
    stage and control panel. The ship's technology and<br>
    design should be noticeably older than the Enterprise<br>
    and should reflect outdated engineering methods and<br>
    philosophy.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - 8/4/92 - TEASER 5A.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The lights are DIM and there doesn't seem to be any<br>
    equipment working at present. One or two of the<br>
    consoles are damaged or burnt out, and the bulkheads<br>
    look smashed and broken.</p>
  <p> Riker, Worf, and GEORDI MATERIALIZE. They immediately<br>
    begin to look around.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - REV. 8/6/92 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (reacts to smell)<br>
    The air's pretty stale.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    Life support is barely operating.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    See if you can increase the oxygen<br>
    level.</p>
  <p> Worf nods and moves to one of the consoles. Geordi's<br>
    tricorder leads him over to the Transporter console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> Riker moves over to take a look.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The Transporter is still<br>
    on-line... it's being fed power<br>
    from the auxiliary systems.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (off console)<br>
    The rematerialization subroutine<br>
    has been disabled.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's not all... the phase<br>
    inducers are connected to the<br>
    emitter array... the override<br>
    is completely gone... and the<br>
    pattern buffer's been locked into<br>
    a continuous diagnostic cycle.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This doesn't make any sense...<br>
    locking the unit in a diagnostic<br>
    mode just sends inert matter<br>
    through the pattern buffer. Why<br>
    would anyone want to --</p>
  <p> Geordi suddenly sees something on the console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There's a pattern still in the<br>
    buffer.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - 8/4/92 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (shocked, off console)<br>
    It's completely intact... less<br>
    than point zero zero three<br>
    percent signal degradation. How<br>
    is that possible?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't know... but I've never<br>
    seen a transporter system<br>
    jury-rigged like this.</p>
  <p> They both look at the monitor for a shocked beat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Could someone... survive in a<br>
    Transporter buffer for<br>
    seventy-five years?</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I know a way to find out.</p>
  <p> Riker thinks for a beat... then nods. Geordi works<br>
    the console for a moment... then activates a final<br>
    control...</p>
  <p>7 ANGLE ON TRANSPORTER STAGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> An OLD-STYLE TRANSPORTER EFFECT begins... a figure<br>
    wavers in the beam for a moment... finally solidifies<br>
    and CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY SCOTT MATERIALIZES in front of<br>
    a shocked Riker &amp; Geordi.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - 8/4/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes) </p>
  <p>8 INT. JENOLAN OPS CENTER</p>
  <p> Continuous action from the Teaser. Riker and Geordi<br>
    are staring at Scott on the Transporter stage. Scott<br>
    looks a little woozy... unsure of his bearings, then<br>
    he seems to shake it off and he moves toward them with<br>
    a plan of action. His left arm is in a sling and he<br>
    has one or two cuts and bruises visible.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Thank you, Lads.</p>
  <p> He quickly steps to the Transporter console and they<br>
    make room for him.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    (working on console)<br>
    We've got to get Franklin out of<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Someone else's pattern is still<br>
    in the buffer?</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Aye. Matt Franklin. We went<br>
    in together.<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Something's wrong... one of the<br>
    inducers has failed...<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Boost the gain on the matter<br>
    stream.</p>
  <p> Geordi works a nearby console.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    (to console)<br>
    Come on, Franklin... I know<br>
    you're still in there...</p>
  <p> He works for another beat... then his face falls as he<br>
    sees something on the console.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - 8/4/92 - ACT ONE 8A.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    It's no use... his pattern's been<br>
    degraded by fifty-three percent...<br>
    he's gone.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> Scott wearily runs a hand across his face.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    So am I... he was a good lad...</p>
  <p> After quiet beat, Riker moves forward to break the<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - REV. 8/6/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm Commander William Riker from<br>
    the starship Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Scott's weary face lights up at this and he breaks into<br>
    a wide smile.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    The Enterprise... I shoulda known.<br>
    And I'll bet it was Jim Kirk<br>
    himself who hauled the old girl<br>
    out of mothballs to come looking<br>
    for me.<br>
    (shakes his hand)<br>
    Captain Montgomery Scott. How<br>
    long have I been missing?</p>
  <p> Riker exchanges a look with Geordi.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well...</p>
  <p> WORF'S VOICE<br>
    Sir.</p>
  <p>8A NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Scott turns around at the sound of Worf's voice.<br>
    Scott stares at him with unabashed shock.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing, to Riker)<br>
    I have restored life support.<br>
    The oxygen levels will return<br>
    to normal shortly.</p>
  <p> Worf notices that Scott is staring at him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (introducing)<br>
    Captain Scott... Lieutenant Worf.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (simply)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - 8/4/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>8A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (gently)<br>
    Captain Scott... perhaps there<br>
    are a few things we should talk<br>
    about.</p>
  <p> Off Scott's reaction...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>9 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE &amp; SPHERE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship next to the mammoth sphere.</p>
  <p>10 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Worf, Scott and Geordi MATERIALIZE on the<br>
    Transporter stage. There is a N.D. TRANSPORTER<br>
    TECHNICIAN at the controls. Scott is fascinated by<br>
    everything he sees here... like a kid in a new and<br>
    unimagined candy shop. The other three step off the<br>
    platform, but Scott stays behind and looks up at the<br>
    overhead Transporter machinery.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (on the move toward the<br>
    door)<br>
    We should probably get you to<br>
    Sickbay. Doctor Crusher will be<br>
    able to...</p>
  <p> Riker trails off as he realizes that Scott isn't with<br>
    them. They turn around and see Scott peering up at<br>
    the ceiling.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    You've changed the resonator<br>
    array... only three phase<br>
    inverters...</p>
  <p> Riker smiles a little and turns to Geordi.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    Geordi, I think our guest is going<br>
    to have a lot of engineering<br>
    questions...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - 8/4/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (grins)<br>
    I'll take care of him, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker glances at Scott again and then he &amp; Worf EXIT.<br>
    Scott has now moved to the bank of optical data chips<br>
    set into the wall. He pulls off the covering panel<br>
    and scrutinizes the interior. Geordi is a little<br>
    concerned, but doesn't stop him as Scott pokes around.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    What have ye done to the duotronic<br>
    enhancers?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Those were replaced with isolinear<br>
    chips about forty years ago. It's<br>
    a lot more efficient now.</p>
  <p> Scott begins to reach in and move something, but<br>
    Geordi stops him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Uh... be careful there. That's<br>
    an EPS power tap.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Ah.</p>
  <p> Geordi closes the panel and then gestures to the doors<br>
    as they head for the corridor.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (on the move)<br>
    You were saying earlier that you<br>
    were on your way to the Norpin<br>
    Colony when you had a warp engine<br>
    failure...</p>
  <p> They EXIT to the Corridor.</p>
  <p>11 INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Scott and Geordi ENTER from Transporter Room and head<br>
    down the corridor. Scott's eyes are continually<br>
    scanning every inch of the corridor. Occasionally he<br>

    That's right. We had an overload<br>
    in one of the plasma transfer<br>
    conduits. The Captain brought<br>
    us out of warp... we hit some<br>
    gravimetric interference and then<br>
    there it was, as big as life...<br>

  <p> SCOTT<br>
    (amazed)<br>
    Aye. An actual Dyson Sphere.<br>
    Can you imagine the engineering<br>
    skills needed to even design such<br>
    a structure...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I know... it's pretty amazing.<br>
    What happened when you first<br>
    approached it?</p>
  <p> They move down the corridor toward a Turbolift.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    We began a standard survey of the<br>
    surface. We were just completing<br>
    the initial orbital scan when our<br>
    aft power coils suddenly exploded.<br>
    The ship got caught in the<br>
    sphere's gravity well... and down<br>
    we went.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What made you think of using the<br>
    Transporter pattern buffer to stay<br>
    alive?</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    We didna have enough supplies to<br>
    wait for a rescue... so I had to<br>
    think of something.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But locking it into a diagnostic<br>
    cycle to keep the signal from<br>
    degrading... and cross connecting<br>
    the phase inducers to provide<br>
    a regenerative power source...<br>
    it's brilliant.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    (sadly)<br>
    I'm afraid it was only fifty<br>
    percent brilliant... Ensign<br>
    Franklin deserved better.</p>
  <p> Geordi tries to shift the subject back to something<br>
    Scott can get excited about.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I think you're going to like the<br>
    twenty-fourth century, Mister<br>
    Scott. We've made some pretty<br>
    incredible advances in the last<br>
    eighty years.</p>
  <p> This does perk Scott up a little as they ENTER the<br>

  <p> SCOTT<br>

    Aye... from what I can see you've<br>
    got a fine ship here, Mister La<br>

    running a medical device over his injured arm. His<br>
    bruises are already gone. Geordi is nearby.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You've had a hairline fracture<br>
    of the humerus.<br>
    (shuts off device)<br>
    It'll ache for a few days, but<br>
    it should be fine.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Thank you.<br>
    (with a smile, to<br>
    Geordi)<br>
    Well, I'll say this for your<br>

    I don't know. How am I feeling?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (she closes tricorder)<br>
    Other than a couple of bumps and<br>
    bruises, I'd say you feel fine<br>

  <p> SCOTT<br>
    (joking, to Picard)<br>
    I don't feel a day over a hundred<br>

    list you as one of their crew.</p>
  <p> Scott's smile fades just a little.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    I wasn't actually a member of the<br>

    I was heading for Norpin Five to<br>
    settle down and enjoy my...<br>
    retirement.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see. Well, I would very much<br>
    enjoy the opportunity to discuss<br>
    your career at some point.<br>
    History is one of my hobbies and<br>
    I'm sure you have some fascinating<br>
    insights into the events of your<br>

  <p> SCOTT<br>
    I'd be happy to.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good. I look forward to it.<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Commander, we need to begin a full<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll get right on it, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> Picard EXITS.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    you're going to do is get some<br>
    rest. You've had quite a shock<br>
    to your system and I don't want<br>
    you to push yourself too hard.</p>
  <p> Geordi intercedes before Scott can protest.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We're pretty busy right now,<br>
    anyway, Captain Scott. But I'd<br>
    be happy to give you a tour of<br>

    the doctor says it's okay.</p>
  <p> Faced with uniform resistance, Scott accedes.</p>

    Good Lord, man... where have you<br>
    put me?</p>
  <p> KANE<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    These are standard guest quarters,<br>
    sir. I can try to find something<br>
    bigger if you want.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Bigger? In my day, even an<br>
    Admiral wouldna had such quarters<br>
    on a starship. I remember a time<br>
    when we had to transport the<br>
    Dohlman of Elaas. You never heard<br>
    anyone whine and complain about<br>
    quarters like that...</p>
  <p> Kane smiles politely.</p>
  <p> KANE<br>
    The Holodecks, Ten Forward, and<br>
    the gymnasium are all at your<br>
    disposal. The computer can tell<br>
    you how to find them. Until we<br>
    issue you a combadge, just use<br>
    one of these panels if you need<br>
    anything.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    You know... these quarters remind<br>
    me of a hotel room I once had on<br>

    Uh, excuse me, sir... but I have<br>
    to return to duty.</p>
  <p> Kane's polite smile has never left his face, but Scott<br>
    suddenly realizes that Kane really isn't interested in<br>
    hearing his stories and Scott's cheerful exuberance<br>
    fades.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>

  <p> Kane EXITS. Scott looks around the room for a moment.<br>
    His smile fades away completely... he sits down...<br>

  <p>16 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Geordi is working in his office while SEVERAL N.D.<br>
    ENGINEERS move about the room, working consoles and<br>
    checking displays. Geordi is talking to an Engineer<br>
    -- BARTEL -- while gesturing to an Okudagram of the<br>
    Dyson Sphere on the monitor.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Bartel)<br>
    I want you to shut down the warp<br>
    engines and recalibrate the aft<br>
    sensors while I work on the<br>
    lateral array.</p>
  <p> BARTEL<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Bartel walks away. Geordi goes back to work on the<br>
    terminal. A few beats pass and then Geordi hears the<br>
    following from o.c.:</p>
  <p> BARTEL'S VOICE<br>
    Can I help you, sir?</p>
  <p> SCOTT'S VOICE<br>
    I don't think so Lass, but I'll<br>
    let you know if you can.</p>
  <p> Geordi moves to look around the corner and is surprised<br>
    to see Scott moving toward the warp core, accompanied<br>
    by a concerned Bartel. (Scott is now wearing an<br>
    Enterprise Combadge).</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - REV. 8/5/92 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Scott is looking at the pulsing warp core with real<br>

  <p> BARTEL<br>
    Sir, this area is restricted to<br>
    authorized --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll handle it, Bartel.</p>
  <p> Bartel acquiesces and leaves. Geordi is a little<br>
    uncomfortable here. He didn't expect Scott to just<br>
    show up like this. Scott is slowly walking around the<br>
    warp core, taking everything in.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain Scott, this... really<br>
    isn't a good time --</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    We're in Engineering. Call me<br>
    Scotty.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Scotty... this really isn't a good<br>
    time for a tour. We're running<br>
    a phase seven survey of the Dyson<br>
    Sphere.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    I'm not here for a tour, Lad.<br>
    I'm here to help.</p>
  <p> Geordi is surprised and it shows.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's... very kind. But I think<br>
    we can handle it...</p>
  <p> Scott moves quickly to the pool table and Geordi<br>

  <p> The graphic shows a cut-away view of the sphere,<br>
    revealing a STAR at the center, and a thin ATMOSPHERE<br>
    clinging to the interior of the sphere itself.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sensor readings indicate the<br>
    presence of a G-type star at the<br>
    center of the sphere. There also<br>
    appears to be a class-M atmosphere<br>
    clinging to the interior surface.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there any indication that the<br>
    sphere is inhabited?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Not as yet, sir. Our preliminary<br>
    data indicates it is still capable<br>
    of supporting life, but we have<br>
    been unable to find definite signs<br>
    of current habitation.</p>
  <p> Picard is clearly intrigued and excited by the thought<br>
    of someone still living in there.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Send out a series of class four<br>

  <p> Scott and Geordi are working at the pool table.<br>
    Scott's attitude is cheerful and excited, but in his<br>
    effort to be helpful he's really straining Geordi's<br>
    patience. (In the b.g., the warp core is OFF.)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to N.D. Engineer)<br>
    Adjust the frequency<br>
    stabilization on the main<br>
    deflector dish. It's out of synch<br>
    with the aft sensors.</p>
  <p> Scott sees something on the pool table and he talks to<br>
    Geordi over part of the above.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    (over above)<br>
    Laddie, ye need to phase-lock the<br>
    warp fields within three percent<br>
    or they'll become unstable.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (distracted)<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    (works console)<br>
    Here. The warp field is --</p>
  <p> But as soon as Scott touches the controls, the pool<br>
    table suddenly sounds an ALARM in response to his<br>
    action. Geordi quickly moves to correct the situation.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We use a multi-phase<br>
    auto-containment field now...<br>
    it's meant to operate above three<br>
    percent.</p>
  <p> Scott seems rattled for only a moment and he quickly<br>
    recovers.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Ah. Well... that would make all<br>
    the difference.</p>
  <p> Bartel calls to Geordi from near the dark warp core.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Bartel goes to work.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    I remember a time when the old<br>
    Enterprise was spiralling in<br>
    toward Psi two thousand... the<br>
    Captain wanted to try a cold start<br>
    of the warp engines. I told him<br>
    that without a proper phase-lock<br>
    it would take at least thirty<br>
    minutes...</p>
  <p> An N.D. Engineer comes up to Geordi with a padd as<br>
    Scott continues with his story.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Engineer)<br>
    Huh? Oh, thanks.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    (moving o.c.)<br>
    &quot;You canna change the laws of<br>
    physics&quot; I said... but of course<br>
    he wouldn't listen so we had to<br>
    come up with a new engine start-up<br>
    routine...</p>
  <p> As Geordi studies the padd and tries valiantly to do<br>
    his job, Scott moves off toward the warp core.</p>
  <p> SCOTT'S VOICE<br>
    (o.c.)<br>
    Do you know that your dilithium<br>
    crystals are about to fracture?</p>
  <p> Geordi looks up at this and then hurries over to the<br>
    warp core. Scott has opened the dilithium chamber at<br>
    the center of the core and is examining the dilithium<br>
    crystals with a critical eye.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - REV. 8/5/92 - ACT TWO 25.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Geordi's patience is starting to wear thin at this<br>
    point.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (shutting the drawer)<br>
    We recomposite the crystals while<br>
    they're still inside the<br>
    articulation frame. I'd like<br>
    to explain everything, but the<br>
    Captain wants this<br>
    spectrographic-analysis done by<br>
    thirteen hundred hours.</p>
  <p> Geordi goes into his office to work. Scott watches<br>
    him for a moment, then goes in and quietly moves to<br>
    Geordi.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Would you mind a little advice?</p>
  <p> Geordi doesn't really want advice, but he holds his<br>
    tongue.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Starship captains are like<br>
    children. They want everything<br>
    right now and they want it their<br>
    way... the secret is to give them<br>
    what they need, not what they<br>
    want.</p>
  <p> Scott's paternalistic attitude is really rubbing Geordi<br>
    the wrong way and the advice itself goes completely<br>
    against Geordi's personality.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I told him I'd have that analysis<br>
    done in an hour.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    (conspiratorially)<br>

    really going to take you?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (irritated)<br>
    Of course I did.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Oh... Laddie. You've got a lot<br>
    to learn if you want them to think<br>
    of you as a miracle worker.<br>
    You've got to --</p>
  <p> But Geordi's patience has just run out and he rounds<br>
    on Scott.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Look, sir. I've tried to be<br>
    patient, I've tried to be polite.<br>
    But I've got a job to do here.<br>
    And you're... in the way.</p>
  <p> Scott's own temper starts to flare, and other people<br>
    turn and stare as his voice rises.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    I was driving starships while your<br>
    great grandfather was still in<br>
    diapers. I'd think you'd be<br>
    grateful for a little help.</p>
  <p> But Geordi's had enough of this and he turns away from<br>
    Scott in exasperation so he can return to his work.<br>
    Scott takes that as an insult.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Then I'll leave ye to work, Mister<br>
    La Forge.</p>
  <p> And with that, Scott storms out of Engineering. Almost<br>

  <p> The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    (demanding)<br>
    What do you want?</p>
  <p> TROI ENTERS. Her demeanor is so pleasant and innocent<br>
    that Scott feels compelled to back away from his anger<br>
    a little.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Is this a bad time?</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Oh... uh, no.<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm glad you're comfortable.<br>

    But I was actually more interested<br>
    in how you feel.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    How I feel?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes. It would be perfectly normal<br>
    to feel disoriented, confused or<br>
    even frightened following the kind<br>
    of extraordinary experience you've<br>
    just had.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    I suppose it's been... a little<br>
    bewildering, yes.</p>
  <p> An awkward pause as Scott wonders where all this is<br>
    going and Troi tries a different tack.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm sure you have a lot of<br>
    questions about what's happened<br>
    over the last seventy-five<br>
    years... if you'd like, I could<br>
    help you access some of our<br>
    historical records... maybe you<br>
    could discover what happened to<br>
    your family... or friends.</p>
  <p> Scott pulls back at this suggestion.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    I'm... not ready for that just<br>
    yet. It's a hard thing to realize<br>
    that everyone ye once knew is<br>
    probably...</p>
  <p> He trails off as he suddenly realizes what tone this<br>

  <p> SCOTT<br>
    And you're an officer?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes. They started assigning<br>
    Counselors to starships about<br>
    forty years ago when they realized<br>
    that the pressures of extended<br>
    space travel --</p>

  <p> SCOTT<br>
    La Forge sent you here, didn't<br>
    he? I may be old, but I'm not<br>
    crazy.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Geordi didn't send me and I know<br>
    you're not crazy.</p>
  <p> Scott gets to his feet, annoyed at this entire affair.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    You're damned right I'm not. And<br>
    I don't need a ship's counselor,<br>
    or a psychologist, or whatever<br>
    else you are.<br>

    down at the bar and a WAITER comes over to him. Data<br>
    is seated at a bar stool nearby.</p>
  <p> WAITER<br>
    May I help you, sir?</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Aye, Lad. Scotch. Neat.</p>
  <p> The Waiter goes to the replicator and presently returns<br>
    with a drink.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Thank you.</p>

    sip. He frowns and then puts down the drink in evident<br>

    What in blazes is this?</p>
  <p> WAITER<br>

    Didn't you order Scotch?</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Lad, I was drinking scotch about<br>
    a hundred years before you were<br>
    born and I can tell you that<br>
    whatever this is, it is definitely<br>
    not scotch.</p>
  <p> Data moves in to help the hapless waiter in the face of<br>
    Scott's wrath.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Waiter)<br>
    I believe I may be of some<br>
    assistance. Captain Scott is<br>
    unaware of the existence of<br>
    synthehol.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Synthehol?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. It is an alcohol substitute<br>
    which is now normally served<br>
    aboard starships. It simulates<br>
    the appearance, smell, and taste<br>
    of alcohol, but the intoxicating<br>
    affects can be easily dismissed.</p>
  <p> Scott just looks at Data for a moment.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    You're not quite... human are you?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, sir. I am an android. My<br>

    moment, then moves behind the bar.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe Guinan does keep a<br>
    limited supply of non-syntheholic<br>
    products. Perhaps one of them<br>
    would be to your liking.</p>
  <p> Data bends down and reaches under the bar... then<br>
    stands up and puts a very old bottle of a green liquid<br>
    on the bar.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> Data is unable to read the label. He removes the cap<br>
    and sniffs the contents... but still doesn't know what<br>
    to make of it... he looks at the liquid and finally<br>
    tells Scott the only thing he knows for certain.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is green.</p>

    he's come home. But without people manning the<br>
    consoles and stations, this is like being aboard a<br>
    ghost ship. Scott goes over to his old station on the<br>
    Bridge (at the back of the Bridge to the right of the<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hope I'm not interrupting, but<br>
    I was just coming off duty and<br>
    wanted to see how you were doing.</p>

    Not at all, not at all. Have a<br>

  <p> SCOTT<br>
    You know, I served aboard eleven<br>

    underpowered vessel that was<br>
    always on the verge of flying<br>
    apart at the seams. In every<br>
    measurable way, my Enterprise is<br>
    a superior ship.<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps Captain Scott could be<br>
    of use in accessing that material.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's possible. He would know<br>

  <p>35 INT. JENOLEN OPS CENTER</p>
  <p> Scott is using a few of his tools on an open panel and<br>
    the old-style interior can be seen as he works. Geordi<br>
    has attached a large DEVICE from his equipment case to<br>
    a console and it BLINKS and FLASHES in response to<br>
    Scott's work. Scott seems a little subdued.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    The primary computer database<br>
    should be on-line now. Give it<br>
    a try.</p>
  <p> Geordi works for a moment and gets a couple of FLASHING<br>
    LIGHTS on his device.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay... I've got three access<br>
    lines to the central core...<br>
    still nothing.</p>
  <p> Scott works for a moment, then gives up in<br>
    irritation... his heart really isn't in this effort.</p>

    It can't handle the interface of<br>
    your power converter.</p>
  <p> Scott opens another panel and begins tinkering with the<br>
    inner working. He's talking about more than just the<br>
    equipment and he's definitely getting more depressed.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    This equipment was designed for<br>
    a different era... now it's just<br>
    a lot of junk.</p>

    Obsolete.</p>
  <p> There's a quiet beat as Geordi suddenly realizes that<br>
    Scott is actually talking about himself. Geordi wants<br>
    to reach out to him in some way... he considers the<br>
    console he was working on for a moment.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's interesting... because I<br>
    was just thinking that a lot of<br>
    these systems haven't changed much<br>
    in seventy-five years.</p>
  <p> Scott has only dull interest in what Geordi is saying,<br>
    but at least he's listening. Geordi moves over to the<br>
    Transporter console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    This Transporter is almost<br>
    identical to the ones we use on<br>
    the Enterprise.<br>
    (gestures to other<br>
    consoles)<br>
    The subspace radio and sensors<br>
    operate on the same basic<br>
    principles, and impulse engine<br>
    design hasn't changed much in two<br>
    hundred years. If it weren't for<br>
    the structural damage, this ship<br>
    could still be in service today.</p>
  <p> There's a beat as Scott considers this.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    (sad smile)<br>
    Maybe so... but when they can<br>
    build a ship like your Enterprise,<br>
    who'd want to pilot an old bucket<br>
    like this?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    begin to see that a new relationship is just starting<br>
    to form. Scott breaks the moment and moves back to<br>
    the computer console.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    We used to have something called<br>

    wouldna have something like that<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Scotty, what if these aren't<br>

    if they're access terminals...<br>
    which are triggered by subspace<br>
    signals on certain frequencies...</p>
  <p> Scott catches on quickly.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Frequencies like our standard<br>
    ship's hail.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Exactly. When the Enterprise<br>
    saw this terminal they probably<br>
    did the same thing you did<br>
    seventy-five years ago -- opened<br>
    a channel. Only this time it<br>
    triggered something which<br>
    activated that hatch and pulled<br>
    the ship inside the sphere.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    A nice bit of reasoning, Lad...<br>
    very nice indeed.</p>
  <p> Geordi flashes a smile of thanks, but they've still got<br>
    a problem.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We could trigger the hatch, but<br>
    we'd probably be pulled in like<br>
    they were.</p>
  <p> They think for a moment, and then Scott suddenly gets a<br>
    twinkle in his eye and turns to Geordi with a grin.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>

    If we trigger the hatch with a<br>
    subspace transmission, we might<br>
    not be pulled inside if we keep<br>
    our distance from the sphere --<br>
    say a half million kilometers.<br>
    Then, when the hatch starts to<br>
    close again, we move in, and use<br>
    the Jenolen to jam the hatch open<br>
    and hope the Enterprise can<br>

    You can't be serious. That hatch<br>
    is huge. It could crush this ship<br>

    Geordi. I've spent my whole life<br>
    figuring out how to make crazy<br>
    things work.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm telling you... one engineer<br>
    to another... I can do this.</p>
  <p> There is a moment as they look at each other... and<br>
    Geordi searches his own heart and instincts for what<br>
    to do. Finally, he makes the decision.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    All right. Let's do it.</p>
  <p> Scott smiles, and then, united in purpose, they turn<br>
    to the consoles.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - 8/4/92 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>48 EXT. SPACE - THE JENOLEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is moving on impulse power and it comes to a<br>
    stop in space. The sphere is o.c.</p>
  <p>49 INT. JENOLEN</p>
  <p> Scott and Geordi are at the controls.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We're at five hundred thousand<br>
    kilometers.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Engines're ready.</p>
  <p> Geordi takes a deep breath... then plunges ahead.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay. Here we go.</p>
  <p> He works the console.</p>
  <p>50 EXT. SPACE - THE SPHERE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The hatch SLIDES OPEN as seen earlier. From around<br>
    the circumference of the circle, THREE BEAMS reach<br>
    up into space and search for a ship... but find<br>
    nothing.</p>
  <p>51 OMITTED</p>
  <p>51A INT. JENOLEN</p>
  <p> As before. Geordi and Scott watching their consoles.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Come on... there's nothing out<br>
    here... give it up.<br>
    (works)<br>
    I still can't open a channel to<br>
    the Enterprise... there's too much<br>
    interference. We'll have to to<br>
    wait until we're right in the<br>
    doorway.</p>
  <p>52 EXT. SPACE - THE SPHERE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The pilot beams fail to grasp onto anything... and<br>
    finally SHUT OFF. The hatch now begins to SLIDE<br>
    CLOSED.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - REV. 8/6/92 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>53 INT. JENOLEN</p>
  <p> As before.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off monitor)<br>
    That's it. Let's go! Full<br>
    impulse.</p>
  <p> They both work the controls.</p>
  <p>54 EXT. SPACE - THE JENOLEN &amp; SPHERE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Jenolen moves into the middle of the doorway as the<br>
    hatch is closing and then STOPS. Suddenly the hatch<br>
    encounters the DEFLECTOR SHIELD of the Jenolen and the<br>
    hatch STOPS. (The shield is only visible when it hits<br>
    the hatch.)</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>54A INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Worf, Data, and Rager at their stations.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Sir. There is an audio message<br>
    from Commander La Forge.</p>
  <p> Picard nods and Worf works his console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    (static)<br>
    This is La Forge, do you read me,<br>
    Enterprise?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    We read you, go ahead Commander.</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>55 INT. JENOLEN</p>
  <p> As before. The ship is SHAKING and the engines are<br>
    ROARING with the strain as Scott works in the b.g.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - REV. 8/6/92 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>55 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Understood.<br>
    (urgent, to Rager)<br>
    Set a course.</p>
  <p>55A EXT. JENOLEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is still stuck in the hatch.</p>
  <p>55B INT. JENOLEN</p>
  <p> As before. There is a sudden VIOLENT SHAKE, and one of<br>
    the panels EXPLODES. Scott rushes over to check the<br>
    damage.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    The plasma intercooler's gone.<br>
    The engines are overheating.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (working console)<br>
    I've lost helm control...<br>
    (to com)<br>
    La Forge to Enterprise. Captain,<br>
    we won't be able to move this ship<br>
    out of the way when you get<br>
    here... you're going to have to<br>
    destroy it in order to escape.</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>56 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As before.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    How long will it take us to reach<br>
    them?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    With impulse engines operating<br>
    at sixty percent power, it will<br>
    take one minute forty seconds.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - REV. 8/13/92 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>56 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    I can't hold her together much<br>
    longer... we've got about two<br>
    minutes before the engines go<br>
    critical.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Bridge to Transporter Room Three.<br>
    Stand by to beam two from the<br>
    Jenolen as soon as we're in range.</p>
  <p>56A EXT. SPACE - IN THE SPHERE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise is heading into the atmosphere and<br>
    toward the distant open hatch.</p>
  <p>56B INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As before.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Photon torpedoes loaded.</p>
  <p>57 INT. JENOLEN</p>
  <p> As before. The ship is falling apart... SHAKING<br>
    badly... consoles starting to SPARK and EXPLODE... the<br>
    lighting is FLICKERING... and the engine noise is a<br>
    SHRIEK of overworked metal.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    (a shout)<br>
    It's coming apart, Lad. I can't<br>
    do anything else.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - 8/4/92 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>58 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As before.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We are within transporter range.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    Bridge to Transporter Room.<br>
    Energize.<br>
    (a quick beat, then<br>
    to Worf)<br>
    Fire torpedoes.</p>
  <p>59 EXT. SPACE - THE SPHERE &amp; JENOLEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Jenolen is still caught in the doorway. Suddenly<br>
    the ship is hit by torpedoes coming from inside the<br>
    sphere. The Jenolen EXPLODES. The hatch starts<br>
    CLOSING.</p>
  <p>59A OMITTED</p>
  <p>59B EXT. SPACE - IN THE SPHERE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise is racing toward the fast closing hatch.</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>59C INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The crew reacts to the sight of the closing hatch on<br>
    the main viewer.</p>
  <p>59D EXT. SPACE - OUTSIDE THE SPHERE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The hatch is almost closed... but then at the last<br>
    second the Enterprise ROLLS 90 degrees to port and<br>
    SLIPS THROUGH the doorway ON ITS SIDE just as the hatch<br>
    SLAMS SHUT.</p>
  <p>60 OMITTED</p>
  <p>61 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Scott and Geordi are just stepping off the platform.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - 8/4/92 - ACT FIVE 60A.</p>
  <p>61 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    (cheerful, to Geordi)<br>
    There now. That wasn't so bad,<br>
    was it?</p>
  <p> Geordi smiles back at him.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>62 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship at impulse power.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - 8/4/92 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>63 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Scott and Geordi are walking toward the shuttlebay.<br>
    For once, Scott is listening to Geordi tell a tall tale<br>
    and they're both in good spirits.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So, this alien space 'baby'--<br>
    which was about the size of a<br>
    four-story building -- really<br>
    thought the Enterprise was its<br>
    mother.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    You're pulling an old man's leg.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No, really. It was 'suckling'<br>
    power directly from the ship's<br>
    fusion reactors... so Doctor<br>
    Brahms and I changed the power<br>
    frequency from twenty-one<br>
    centimeters to point-oh-two<br>
    centimeters...</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    (catching on fast)<br>
    You soured the milk.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's right.</p>
  <p> They both laugh and then a slight touch of sadness<br>
    comes over him.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Enjoy these times, Geordi. You're<br>
    the chief engineer of a<br>
    starship... it's a time of your<br>
    life that'll never come again...<br>
    and once it's gone... it's gone.</p>
  <p> A long quiet beat.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - 8/4/92 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Geordi stops in front of the Shuttlebay doors.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    I thought you were going to buy<br>
    me a drink in Ten Forward.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I have a better idea.</p>
  <p> He indicates the doors and then they both EXIT to the<br>
    Shuttlebay.</p>
  <p>64 INT. SHUTTLEBAY - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Geordi and Scott ENTER from the Corridor. Scott is<br>
    surprised by what he sees.</p>
  <p>65 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Revealing Picard, Riker, Worf, Beverly, Troi, and Data<br>
    all standing next to a LARGE SHUTTLECRAFT. Scott is<br>
    stunned as he looks over the gleaming ship.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    You're giving me one of your<br>
    shuttles?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Call it... an extended loan.<br>
    Since you lost your ship while<br>
    saving ours, it seemed only fair.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: shuttle)<br>
    It's not much to look at...</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Lad, every woman has her own<br>
    charms... ye just have to know<br>
    where to look.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - 8/4/92 - ACT FIVE 62A.</p>
  <p>65 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's a little slow, but it'll get<br>
    you to the Norpin colony... if<br>
    that's really where you want to<br>
    go.</p>
  <p> Scott looks at the ship... and we see a change come<br>
    over his features... he seems rejuvenated. Scott turns<br>
    to Geordi and smiles broadly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Relics&quot; - 8/4/92 - ACT FIVE 63.</p>
  <p>65 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    The Norpin Colony is where old<br>
    men go to retire... maybe I'll<br>
    end up there someday... but not<br>
    just yet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (holds out hand)<br>
    Bon voyage, Mister Scott.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    Thank you, sir. For everything.</p>
  <p> Everyone says goodbye and Scott shakes hands with<br>
    several of them before he and Geordi move off to the<br>
    shuttle for a final moment. Scott glances back at the<br>
    others.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    They're a good crew.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah.</p>
  <p> Scott looks around the shuttlebay.</p>
  <p> SCOTT<br>
    And she's a fine ship... a credit<br>
    to her name.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I've always found that a ship<br>
    is only as good as the Engineer<br>
    who takes care of her... and from<br>
    what I can see... the Enterprise<br>
    is in good hands.</p>
  <p> There's a moment between the two of them... they shake<br>
    hands... and Scott gets into the shuttle.</p>
  <p>66 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE &amp; SHUTTLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The shuttle leaves the ship and the two fly off in<br>
    different directions.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
