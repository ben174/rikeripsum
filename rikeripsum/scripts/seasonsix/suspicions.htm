  <p> The doors slide OPEN and BEVERLY ENTERS, looking high<br>
    strung and extremely agitated. She leans against the<br>
    door, takes a breath... then tosses a medical PADD<br>
    onto the couch. A beat passes by... then moves to a<br>
    closet and pulls out a small suitcase... begins to pack<br>
    some personal belongings...</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (on edge)<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES again.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Alright, come in.</p>
  <p> GUINAN ENTERS. She's holding her arm carefully.<br>
    Beverly glances up.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Guinan... ? What are you doing<br>
    here?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I need a doctor.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at her.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Geordi beat me in straight sets<br>
    today.<br>
    (indicates arm)<br>
    I think I've got a case of tennis<br>
    elbow.</p>

  <p> Beverly keeps packing, distracted.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Go to Sickbay. I think Doctor<br>
    Selar is on duty.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I don't want to see Selar. I<br>
    always see you. I'm particular<br>
    about my doctors.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well, you'd better get a new<br>
    one... because I'm not a doctor<br>
    on this ship anymore.</p>
  <p> OFF their reactions...</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes) </p>
  <p>3 OMITTED</p>
  <p>4 INT. BEVERLY'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> A few minutes later. Beverly is packing as Guinan<br>
    looks on. Beverly is still very agitated. She keeps<br>
    moving from the closet to the suitcase, messily<br>
    stuffing clothing into the suitcase. Her tone is<br>
    sarcastic and bitter.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (rapid)<br>
    Three days on the shuttle to<br>
    Starbase twenty-three... then a<br>
    transport back to Earth... I can<br>
    hear Admiral Brooks now, telling<br>
    me how I've disgraced Starfleet<br>
    Medical...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Then a leisurely day and a half<br>
    before the formal inquiry begins<br>
    and my career ends.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (calm)<br>
    Beverly.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at her.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    My elbow.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Your elbow... ?</p>
  <p> Guinan lifts her elbow to remind Beverly. Beverly<br>
    takes a breath, stuffs whatever she's holding into her<br>
    bag.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Alright, let me see it...</p>
  <p> Guinan sits in a chair as Beverly examines her arm,<br>
    moving it gently back and forth. Guinan winces<br>
    slightly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Does that hurt?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - 02/25/93 - ACT ONE 4A.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Yeah, right there...</p>
  <p> Beverly nods.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Tennis elbow, alright. Hold it<br>
    like this...</p>
  <p> Beverly positions Guinan's arm, then moves to a nearby<br>
    medical kit, brings it over and opens it up. She takes<br>
    out a small medical device.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I've never been to a formal<br>
    inquiry.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's no big thing. Any doctor can<br>
    have one... all you have to do is<br>
    disobey orders... violate medical<br>
    ethics... cause an interstellar<br>
    incident...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    That would do it, all right.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Make a fist.</p>
  <p> Guinan makes a fist. Beverly continues to treat her<br>
    arm.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Do I have to break my leg before<br>
    you tell me what happened?</p>
  <p> Beverly takes a breath... tries to collect her<br>
    scattered thoughts.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It started when I invited those<br>
    scientists on board...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    No. It started at the Altine<br>
    Consortium.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Actually, it probably started<br>
    before that. When I began<br>
    feeling... comfortable.</p>
  <p> Beverly is so agitated she's rambling, disconnected.<br>
    Guinan is forced to become a knitter of thoughts.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - REV. 02/26/93 - ACT ONE 4B.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Comfortable?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Too comfortable.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Ah.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (nods)<br>
    That's why I went to the Altine<br>
    Conference... to hear the latest<br>
    bio-physical theories. Maybe find<br>
    a new area of research. And<br>
    that's where I met Doctor Reyga...<br>
    nobody would listen to him -- just<br>
    because he was a Ferengi. They<br>
    all but jeered him off the<br>
    stage...</p>
  <p> Guinan is trying to fit all the pieces together.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    So you invited the scientists on<br>
    board... to listen to this Doctor<br>
    Reyga...</p>
  <p> Guinan's ability to fill in the blanks prods Beverly to<br>
    open up more.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I thought I could be a...<br>
    facilitator. You see, he had this<br>
    amazing invention, based on<br>
    metaphasic field technology. But<br>
    his methodology was completely<br>
    unorthodox.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    That's my favorite kind.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I thought... if I could bring<br>
    scientists from various cultures<br>
    aboard the Enterprise... sit them<br>
    down... help them understand the<br>
    value of his ideas... well, it<br>
    seemed like the right thing to do.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - REV. 02/26/93 - ACT ONE 4C.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Sort of a scientific diplomat.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's it exactly. And believe<br>
    me, it wasn't easy.</p>
  <p> Beverly puts down her medical device and begins pacing.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I had to persuade Captain<br>
    Picard... and then I had to round<br>
    up as many scientists as I could<br>
    in the field of subspace<br>
    technology...</p>
  <p> BEGIN FLASHBACK:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - REV. 03/01/93 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p>5 INT. SCIENCE LAB</p>
  <p> A laboratory with a number of consoles, monitors, etc.<br>
    The various scientists are there, sitting and standing,<br>
    as Beverly's V.O. continues.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (V.O.)<br>
    ... but of all the scientists I<br>
    invited, only four were interested<br>
    in hearing about Doctor Reyga's<br>
    invention.</p>
  <p> The scientists are: a male Ferengi, REYGA; a female<br>
    Klingon, KURAK; a female Vulcan, T'PAN and her human<br>
    husband, DOCTOR CHRISTOPHER; and a male Takaran (a new<br>
    alien), JO'BRIL. They're in the midst of a long<br>
    discussion. The discussion continues under (NOTE:<br>
    Added dialogue found at end of script) as the CAMERA<br>
    PANS around the table with Beverly's V.O. introducing<br>
    each character.</p>
  <p> On Kurak:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (V.O.)<br>
    Kurak was a warp field specialist<br>
    on the Klingon Homeworld. I don't<br>
    think Klingons regard scientists<br>
    very highly... she always seemed<br>
    a little defensive.</p>
  <p> On T'Pan and Christopher:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (V.O.)<br>
    Doctor T'Pan is practically a<br>
    legend in the field of subspace<br>
    morphology. She's been the<br>
    director of the Vulcan Science<br>
    Academy for fifteen years...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Her husband, Doctor Christopher,<br>
    came with her... I didn't know<br>
    much about him... but he was some<br>
    kind of a subspace theoretician.</p>
  <p> On Jo'Bril:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (V.O.)<br>
    Jo'Bril was a Takaran... the first<br>
    one I'd ever met. I had no idea<br>
    what to expect from him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - REV. 03/01/93 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> On Reyga:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (V.O.)<br>
    And then there was Doctor Reyga...<br>
    the Ferengi scientist.</p>
  <p> REYGA<br>
    You've all seen my experimental<br>
    data. The metaphasic shield has<br>
    been proven.</p>
  <p> T'PAN<br>
    Forgive my skepticism, Doctor, but<br>
    your claims are somewhat<br>
    extravagant. Protect a shuttle<br>
    within a star's corona? Not even<br>
    your own government believes it<br>
    can be done.</p>
  <p> Reyga bridles at the implication but stays calm. He is<br>
    not the typical volatile, argumentative Ferengi;<br>
    rather, he projects an air of dignity and integrity.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's why I've asked you all to<br>
    come here. I think you have the<br>
    vision to see the potential in<br>
    Doctor Reyga's metaphasic shield.</p>
  <p> Beverly is her composed, capable self on the surface...<br>
    but underneath, she has the mild anxiety of someone<br>
    engaged in a pursuit not wholly familiar. Her task --<br>
    to help make a Ferengi scientist credible -- is not an<br>
    easy one.</p>
  <p> REYGA<br>
    I need help to develop the shield.<br>
    I am willing to grant exclusive<br>
    rights to whoever provides the<br>
    necessary resources.</p>
  <p> There is a small silence at this. Clearly some of the<br>
    scientists don't feel this is a thrilling proposal.<br>
    Beverly looks around the room... tries to stimulate<br>
    some response.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I think you all realize what this<br>
    shielding process would mean...<br>
    the possibilities for exploration<br>
    and research are endless...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - REV. 02/26/93 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> KURAK<br>
    But only if it works.<br>
    (to Reyga)<br>
    I'm not convinced this metaphasic<br>
    shield can withstand either the<br>
    temperature or the radiation it<br>
    would be exposed to.</p>
  <p> REYGA<br>
    But it has -- not only in<br>
    countless simulations, but in a<br>
    field test that I conducted<br>
    myself.</p>
  <p> KURAK<br>
    For which, of course, we have only<br>
    your word...</p>
  <p> REYGA<br>
    Are you accusing me of falsifying<br>
    my data?</p>
  <p> KURAK<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    You wouldn't be the first<br>
    scientist to manipulate<br>
    experimental data to his own<br>
    advantage...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (leaping in to diffuse<br>
    this)<br>
    Doctor Reyga has offered to<br>
    demonstrate his invention. He's<br>
    outfitted one of our shuttles with<br>
    the metaphasic shield.</p>
  <p> REYGA<br>
    I will take it into the corona of<br>
    the star Vaytan.</p>
  <p> CHRISTOPHER<br>
    That star has a superdense corona.<br>
    The shuttle would be subjected to<br>
    particularly intense radiation.<br>
    Perhaps it would be wise to choose<br>
    a star of lesser magnitude.</p>
  <p> T'PAN<br>
    I agree. My own research into<br>
    solar energy transfer suggests<br>
    that Vaytan's corona is extremely<br>
    unstable.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - REV. 03/03/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> REYGA<br>
    (mildly)<br>
    What better way to test my<br>
    invention? I'm not concerned --<br>
    the shield will hold.</p>
  <p> KURAK<br>
    I, for one, would feel more<br>
    comfortable if someone else flew<br>
    the shuttle. Someone more --<br>
    objective.</p>
  <p> JO'BRIL<br>
    I will volunteer for that task.</p>
  <p> All heads turn toward Jo'Bril. These are the first<br>
    words he has uttered.</p>
  <p> JO'BRIL<br>
    I've spent years studying solar<br>
    plasma reactions. The thought of<br>
    being able to penetrate a star's<br>
    corona... it's a remarkable<br>
    opportunity.<br>
    (to Reyga)<br>
    I've studied your data. I think<br>
    you're on solid scientific ground.</p>
  <p> KURAK<br>
    I don't share your optimism,<br>
    Doctor Jo'Bril... but if you wish<br>
    to pilot the craft, I would be<br>
    more confident about your<br>
    assessment of the shield... than<br>
    Doctor Reyga's.</p>
  <p> CHRISTOPHER<br>
    I agree. At this point, we need<br>
    an impartial evaluation.</p>
  <p> Beverly is a little concerned -- this is an unexpected<br>
    development.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We'd want to be sure that you're<br>
    familiar with the shuttle<br>
    controls... and Doctor Reyga's<br>
    modifications...</p>
  <p> JO'BRIL<br>
    (waving this off)<br>
    I'm an accomplished pilot. It<br>
    will be no problem.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - REV. 03/03/93 - ACT ONE 8A.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well...<br>
    (to Reyga)<br>
    What do you think?</p>
  <p> To Reyga, this is a godsend -- someone believes in him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - REV. 03/02/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> REYGA<br>
    Doctor Jo'Bril... I am gratified.<br>
    And there will be no difficulty<br>
    operating the metaphasic controls --<br>
    the system will activate<br>
    automatically as you approach the<br>
    star.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks around the room... feeling pleased...<br>
    this has gone even better than she'd expected.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well, then. We'll proceed with<br>
    the demonstration at fifteen<br>
    hundred hours. We'll meet on the<br>
    Bridge.</p>
  <p> The group breaks up and files out the door. Reyga<br>
    stays behind with Beverly, gathering PADDS into his<br>
    case.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I think that went well, don't you?</p>
  <p> REYGA<br>
    Thanks to you, Doctor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I didn't do anything...</p>
  <p> They move toward the door and EXIT.</p>
  <p>6 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as they continue walking.</p>
  <p> REYGA<br>
    This is an opportunity I would<br>
    never have had without you, and I<br>
    promise you I'll never forget it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Some of those scientists are still<br>
    a little doubtful... but after the<br>
    demonstration I'm sure they'll<br>
    come around.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - 02/25/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> REYGA<br>
    If there's anything I'm used to --<br>
    it's skepticism.<br>
    (small laugh)<br>
    After all -- a Ferengi scientist<br>
    is almost a contradiction in<br>
    terms.</p>
  <p> She starts to protest, but he raises a hand.</p>
  <p> REYGA<br>
    No, don't deny it. I know how the<br>
    Ferengi are regarded...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'd still expect the scientific<br>
    community to be more open-minded<br>
    than they seem to be.</p>
  <p> REYGA<br>
    The metaphasic shield is a<br>
    breakthrough in technology... many<br>
    scientists have tried to develop<br>

    be some... resistance...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You mean jealousy.<br>
    (shakes her head)<br>
    I know. I wondered if that might<br>
    account for Doctor T'Pan's<br>
    attitude. She's been working on<br>
    subspace shielding technology for<br>
    years. And you've beaten her to<br>
    the punch.</p>
  <p> REYGA<br>
    I'm really not interested in<br>
    competition. All I want is to be<br>
    acknowledged... respected as a<br>
    scientist. This invention will<br>
    finally do that.</p>
  <p> Beverly smiles and they walk on down the corridor<br>
    together.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (V.O.)<br>
    As far as I was concerned, the<br>
    hard part was over. I'd stepped<br>
    out on a limb... and it hadn't<br>
    broken.</p>

  <p> PICARD, DATA, WORF, Beverly, and the four scientists --<br>
    T'Pan, Christopher, Reyga, and Kurak. They are<br>

  <p> BEVERLY (V.O.)<br>
    Not bad for my first venture into<br>

    I'm one million kilometers from<br>

    External temperature is zero-pointnine<br>
    million Kelvins and rising.<br>
    Radiation levels are nearing ten<br>

  <p> REYGA<br>
    That should have no effect on the<br>

    Wait -- I'm reading elevated<br>
    neutriono levels in the cabin...</p>
  <p> REYGA<br>
    Those are from the subspace field<br>

  <p> Reyga smiles proudly. So far, so good. Now, on the<br>
    screen, the glow from the sun's brilliance begins to<br>
    wash over Jo'Bril.</p>
  <p> JO'BRIL<br>
    I'm nearing the corona... Three<br>
    hundred fifty thousand kilometers<br>
    and closing... this is<br>
    incredible... I'm actually flying<br>
    into a star...</p>
  <p> Picard is caught up in the moment. He turns to Reyga.</p>

    Congratulations, Doctor. This is<br>

  <p> Reyga turns to T'Pan, Christopher, and Kurak.</p>
  <p> REYGA<br>
    You see, Doctors? Metaphasic<br>
    shielding is a reality.</p>
  <p> T'Pan nods graciously; Christopher acquiesces; Kurak<br>
    just stares at the Viewscreen, not acknowledging Reyga.</p>
  <p> The shuttle windows are now engulfed in flames.<br>
    Jo'Bril stares ahead, transfixed... almost zoned out...</p>
  <p> REYGA<br>
    Doctor Jo'Bril, can you give us an<br>
    estimate of the plasma turbulence?</p>
  <p> No response.</p>
  <p> REYGA<br>
    Doctor Jo'Bril... ?</p>
  <p> Still no answer. Reyga glances at Beverly.</p>

    Something's wrong.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Data, what's going on?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

  <p> REYGA<br>
    No... that's not possible...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor Jo'Bril, can you hear us?<br>
    Please respond.</p>
  <p> Jo'Bril opens his mouth, as though to try to speak...<br>
    but can only gasp.</p>

    Mister Worf, can we beam him out<br>
    of there?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (checks console)<br>
    The solar radiation is<br>
    interfering... he must be at<br>
    least five-hundred thousand<br>
    kilometers from the star before we<br>
    can get a Transporter lock.</p>
  <p> Picard moves toward the Viewscreen, speaking firmly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor Jo'Bril... listen to me.<br>
    It is imperative that you turn the<br>
    shuttle... take it out of the<br>
    corona...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Do you understand what I'm saying?</p>
  <p> With an effort, Jo'Bril nods...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Pilot the shuttle away from the<br>
    star...</p>
  <p> Jo'Bril lifts his hands... touches controls... the<br>
    shuttle turns... then Jo'Bril slumps over,<br>
    unconscious.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We're losing him...</p>

    The shuttle is emerging from the<br>

  <p> Jo'Bril twitches once more. Beverly scans. She looks<br>
    up at Ogawa, shakes her head. Ogawa removes the<br>

  <p> Beverly is still flinging things into her suitcases.<br>
    Guinan is seated, feet up on a table, taking it all in.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    So that was my first experience as<br>
    a scientific diplomat.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    A complete failure. I don't think<br>
    I've ever felt so awful.</p>
  <p> She tosses something into the suitcase.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes. But I don't know why.</p>
  <p> Beverly is frustrated, struggling, has completely lost<br>
    perspective on her feelings.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    If I had to hazard a guess... I'd<br>
    say that when you're dealing with<br>
    a patient... you feel like you're<br>
    in control.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    How's it going?</p>
  <p> Beverly turns to him. She is baffled.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've never run into a humanoid<br>
    species like this...</p>
  <p> She gestures to an OKUDAGRAM of Jo'Bril's insides on<br>
    the wall monitor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    His internal physiology is<br>
    baffling. He doesn't seem to have<br>
    discrete &quot;organs&quot;... at least not<br>
    in the traditional sense...<br>
    practically every system is evenly<br>
    distributed throughout his body.</p>
  <p> She stares for a moment at the Okudagram.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That kind of physiology should<br>
    make him incredibly resistant to<br>
    injury... so whatever killed him<br>
    had to occur at the cellular<br>
    level...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you have any idea what it was?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No. Something caused a massive,<br>
    system-wide failure... but I don't<br>
    know what.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Were the solar radiation levels<br>
    high enough to have killed him?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (shakes her head)<br>
    His exposure to the star's<br>
    radiation was minimal. It's all<br>
    very strange...</p>

  <p>14 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Doctor, here's the result of the<br>
    tissue scan you asked for.</p>
  <p> Beverly takes a PADD from her, reads it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's odd... his rate of cellular<br>
    decay is extremely low...</p>
  <p> She turns away, stymied, and stares at the wall<br>
    monitor. Ogawa busies herself with some medical<br>
    equipment, and Picard moves to join Beverly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The answers will come, Beverly...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (eyes on monitor)<br>
    Maybe even minimal exposure to<br>
    radiation altered his physiology<br>
    at the cellular level...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You've been at this for hours...<br>
    You might think more clearly if<br>
    you get a good night's sleep.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I couldn't close my eyes. I have<br>
    to find out what killed him. I<br>
    owe that to Doctor Reyga.</p>

    Are you doing it for Reyga... or<br>
    yourself?</p>
  <p> She turns to look at him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What do you mean?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're the loneliest person in the<br>
    world right now... no one can say<br>
    anything... no one can do anything<br>
    that will help. You don't think<br>
    it'll ever go away.<br>

  <p> Data and Reyga are inside the cabin, examining Reyga's<br>

  <p> Reyga is certain... but the others clearly have their<br>

    Perhaps he could not live with the<br>
    failure of his invention, and took<br>
    his own life.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Or perhaps someone just wants it<br>
    to look that way.<br>
    (indicating plasma<br>
    infuser)<br>
    Look at this... isn't it odd that<br>
    he could hold on so tightly to the<br>
    infuser when it was discharged.<br>
    The normal reflex would be to drop<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The plasma shock could have<br>
    affected his nervous system. He<br>
    may have reacted by gripping<br>
    tighter.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Is your examination complete,<br>
    Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    For now. You can transfer the<br>
    body to the Morgue.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Very well.</p>
  <p> Beverly stares at Reyga's body as Worf directs the<br>
    Security Guards to conclude their investigation.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (V.O.)<br>
    I remembered his passion... and<br>
    commitment... and his<br>
    determination to prove himself.<br>
    And I was sure that this man had<br>
    not taken his own life.</p>
  <p>20 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard and Beverly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jean-Luc, I was with him right<br>
    before he died. He was not<br>
    suicidal.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - 02/25/93 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I respect your instincts, of<br>
    course... but by your own<br>
    admission, Reyga was not an easy<br>
    man to understand. Isn't it<br>
    possible that he was simply<br>
    masking his feelings?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't think so. He was<br>
    disappointed at the failure of his<br>
    device... and upset by Jo'Bril's<br>
    death... but there was no sense<br>
    that he was ready to take his own<br>
    life.</p>
  <p> Picard understands Beverly's plight... tries to<br>
    sympathize.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure it's difficult for you to<br>
    accept. You championed him... you<br>
    believed in his invention...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - 02/25/93 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    This isn't about my feelings --<br>
    I'm saying that Reyga didn't kill<br>
    himself... and if that's true,<br>
    someone else did it.</p>
  <p> Picard regards her gravely. This is a strong<br>
    accusation. He tries to find the right way to proceed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Beverly... I know what you're<br>
    going through. I know what it's<br>
    like to feel -- responsible for a<br>
    tragedy. I know the temptation to<br>
    look for anything that would<br>
    remove some of that culpability...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (dismissing this)<br>
    I know I can't expect you to<br>
    accept what I'm saying without<br>
    evidence. When I've finished the<br>
    autopsy, I hope I'll have it.</p>
  <p> She starts toward the door.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm afraid there won't be an<br>
    autopsy.</p>
  <p> She turns back, caught off guard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The family has already been<br>
    contacted... they insist the body<br>
    must not be touched before they<br>
    perform the Ferengi death rituals.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But... there's a question about<br>
    the circumstances of his death --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    To the family, that is irrelevant.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - 02/25/93 - ACT THREE 31A.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Beverly is stunned... can't believe this is happening.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Maybe if I talked to them...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I promise you -- they are adamant.<br>
    We're scheduled to rendezvous with<br>
    a Ferengi ship in seventeen hours.<br>
    They will be picking up Reyga's<br>
    body then.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm sorry. But there will be no<br>
    autopsy.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can't just let it drop... don't<br>
    you see -- ? There might have<br>
    been a murder.</p>
  <p> He considers... sees her genuine anguish.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you can find evidence of<br>
    that... in some way other than an<br>
    autopsy... I'll consider it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - REV. 03/03/93 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Beverly nods... but she is too upset even to speak.<br>
    She turns and EXITS. Picard stares after her, aware of<br>
    her distress.</p>
  <p>21 INT. MORGUE</p>
  <p> The ship's morgue is a fairly simple room with a bank<br>
    of TILT-DOWN STASIS DRAWERS along one of the walls. A<br>
    few pieces of medical equipment, consoles, wall panels,<br>
    etc. are visible.</p>
  <p> Beverly operates controls, and one of the drawers TILTS<br>
    DOWN to reveal the body of Reyga. Ogawa is there.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    I don't understand, Doctor. Isn't<br>
    it pretty clear that Reyga died<br>
    from a plasma discharge?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's not clear without an autopsy.<br>
    For all I know, he might have been<br>
    poisoned... and the plasma infuser<br>
    put in his hand after he died.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    You think he was murdered?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm not discounting that<br>
    possibility. The point is,<br>
    without a complete autopsy,<br>
    there's no way to know for<br>
    certain.</p>
  <p> Reyga's body now lies flat in front of them. Beverly<br>
    takes a tricorder from a nearby cart.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Why won't the Ferengi allow it?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It has to do with their death<br>
    rituals. The body can't be<br>
    violated before it's buried...<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - REV. 03/03/93 - ACT THREE 32A.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And apparently the family is more<br>
    concerned with ritual than with<br>
    finding out the truth about his<br>
    death.</p>
  <p> She glances at the tricorder.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing, frustrated)<br>
    I just can't get the information<br>
    I need from a tricorder scan...</p>
  <p> She snaps shut the tricorder.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Suspects.</p>
  <p> Ogawa gives her a questioning look.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If Reyga didn't kill himself...<br>
    someone else did. So who are the<br>
    possible suspects?</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Whoever had something to gain from<br>
    his death...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And the only ones I see that fit<br>
    that category -- are the other<br>
    scientists.</p>
  <p> She sets down her tricorder and starts for the door.<br>
    Ogawa touches controls, and the drawer begins to TILT<br>
    UP.</p>

  <p>21A INT. CHRISTOPHER'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Christopher and T'Pan with Beverly.</p>
  <p> CHRISTOPHER<br>
    I'm afraid I don't understand,<br>
    Doctor. Do you have evidence that<br>
    Reyga was murdered?</p>
  <p> Beverly is warm... not pushy... just trying to feel her<br>
    way through the situation and get whatever she can.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No. But I just can't accept the<br>
    fact that he took his own life...<br>
    and I want to explore the<br>
    possibilities a bit further.</p>
  <p> T'PAN<br>
    What reason would anyone have had<br>
    to kill him?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's why I came to you. I<br>
    wondered if you might have any<br>
    thoughts along that line...</p>
  <p> T'Pan frowns, puzzling through this in her Vulcan way.</p>
  <p> T'PAN<br>
    I'm not sure what you mean.</p>
  <p> Beverly smiles, self-effacing.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm not sure, either. Just...<br>
    anything you might have heard, or<br>
    observed... that might provide a<br>
    clue...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Just as an example... if his<br>
    technology had been successful,<br>
    you might have been displaced as<br>
    the preeminent scientist in<br>
    subspace technology. That might<br>
    seem like a motive. Of course, it<br>
    wasn't successful...</p>
  <p> T'PAN<br>
    I understand your point, Doctor.<br>
    And I don't know of anything like<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - REV. 02/26/93 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>21A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Christopher jumps in.</p>
  <p> CHRISTOPHER<br>
    I must say I resent this, Doctor.<br>
    We've all been shocked by the<br>
    recent events. I don't see that<br>
    there's anything to gain by<br>
    dragging us through these<br>
    insinuations.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (mildly)<br>
    I'm just trying to uncover the<br>
    truth. And I'm asking your help<br>
    to do it. Have you seen or heard<br>
    anything that might suggest that<br>
    someone else had a motive?</p>
  <p> CHRISTOPHER<br>
    We'd like to forget the<br>
    unpleasantness of the last several<br>
    days... not have it stirred up<br>
    again. I find it disturbing that<br>
    you would try to foster suspicions<br>
    among us...</p>
  <p> Beverly regards him, curious at his attack.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Forgive me... but I get the<br>
    feeling you're protesting a little<br>
    too vehemently...</p>
  <p> CHRISTOPHER<br>
    (uncomfortable)<br>
    I find your question distasteful.</p>
  <p> But she's beginning to suspect he's covering something.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Is there something you're not<br>
    telling me?</p>
  <p> CHRISTOPHER<br>
    I'm sure it's nothing...</p>
  <p> Beverly waits... a long beat... won't let him off the<br>
    hook. Finally --</p>

  <p>21A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> CHRISTOPHER<br>
    I was in the storage room of the<br>
    science laboratory yesterday...<br>
    Kurak was working in the lab. I<br>
    heard Reyga come in... they got<br>
    into... an argument.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    About what?</p>
  <p> CHRISTOPHER<br>
    I don't know... I couldn't hear<br>
    clearly until they started<br>
    shouting at each other.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Then I heard Kurak say that Reyga<br>
    had questioned her honor, and no<br>
    Klingon would stand for that.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - REV. 03/02/93 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>21A CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Before Beverly can respond, he hurries on.</p>
  <p> CHRISTOPHER<br>
    But I do not believe she killed<br>
    him. They were words spoken in<br>
    the heat of anger. Kurak is<br>
    volatile... passionate... but not<br>
    a killer.</p>
  <p> Christopher moves to his wife and puts his arm around<br>
    her shoulder, so the two of them present a united<br>
    front. Over the next, Beverly nods and heads for the<br>
    door, EXITS.</p>
  <p> CHRISTOPHER<br>
    And, Doctor -- neither are we.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (V.O.)<br>
    I knew he might be right about<br>
    Kurak... Klingons make threats as<br>
    a matter of course. On the other<br>
    hand... sometimes they follow<br>
    through.</p>
  <p>22 INT. SCIENCE LAB</p>
  <p> Beverly ENTERS to find Kurak alone in the room, working<br>
    at a terminal; an OKUDAGRAM of a shuttlecraft is<br>
    displayed in a monitor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That looks like one of Doctor<br>
    Reyga's shield configurations.</p>
  <p> KURAK<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> She taps a panel and the display goes out.</p>
  <p> KURAK<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Personal research.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You seem very interested in<br>
    technology that failed.</p>
  <p> KURAK<br>
    No one has denied there is<br>
    potential in the idea.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - REV. 03/02/93 - ACT THREE 35A.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Which you're now free to<br>
    develop...</p>
  <p> Kurak's head snaps up. She rises, faces Beverly<br>
    challengingly. The next interchange becomes<br>
    progressively more tense.</p>
  <p> KURAK<br>
    Are you accusing me of something?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No... but I want to know why you<br>
    threatened Reyga.</p>
  <p> Kurak reacts -- how did she know about that? But she<br>
    doesn't deny it.</p>
  <p> KURAK<br>
    I warned him that if he persisted<br>
    with his slander he would pay the<br>
    price.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What did he accuse you of?</p>
  <p> KURAK<br>
    I will not repeat his lies.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Were they lies?</p>
  <p> KURAK<br>
    Be careful, Doctor. Insulting the<br>
    honor of a Klingon can be<br>
    extremely dangerous.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Did Reyga make that mistake?</p>
  <p> There's a tense, silent beat. Then, without a word,<br>
    Kurak GRABS Beverly and HURLS her into a wall.</p>
  <p> KURAK<br>
    I have heard enough accusations.<br>
    Now, I will have your silence.</p>
  <p> Beverly responds immediately with equal intensity.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're going to have to throw me<br>
    a lot harder than that to get it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - REV. 03/02/93 - ACT THREE 35B.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> There is a tense beat. Beverly is not backing down an<br>
    inch.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Now. What did he accuse you of?</p>
  <p> There is a hesitation, then --</p>
  <p> KURAK<br>
    Sabotage.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Sabotage... of the metaphasic<br>
    shield... was that why it failed?</p>
  <p> KURAK<br>
    How would I know?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Did you sabotage the project?</p>
  <p> KURAK<br>
    No. I did not.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Good-bye, Doctor.</p>
  <p> Kurak returns to the console and snaps it on. Turning<br>
    her back on Beverly, she sits and begins working again.<br>
    Beverly stares at her for a moment, then turns to the<br>
    door. As she does, she winces, and rubs her sore neck.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (V.O.)<br>
    I was beginning to find out that<br>
    investigating a murder was a<br>
    little more perilous than I'd<br>
    thought. And I really didn't have<br>
    any more insight than I did before<br>
    I started.</p>

    Beverly. What can I do for you?</p>
  <p> A beat as Beverly stands uncomfortably.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    Jean-Luc. I'm going to tell you<br>
    something you need to know. You<br>
    won't like it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I just did an autopsy on Doctor<br>
    Reyga.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts sharply. He's angry, but, for the<br>
    moment, he keeps it in check; he wants to give her a<br>
    chance to explain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And what did you find?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Nothing.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't<br>
    have done it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You most certainly should not. I<br>
    made it clear to you that the<br>
    family expressly prohibited it.<br>
    You have not only disobeyed my<br>
    order, you have interfered in the<br>

    You've put both of us in a very<br>

    The family will have to be<br>
    notified. And I have no doubt<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    If the Ferengi government gets<br>

    I'm not sure how much I could<br>
    protect you.</p>

    You don't have to, Jean-Luc. I<br>
    knew what I was doing. I'm<br>

  <p> Guinan looks at her mildly, flexing her arm. Beverly<br>
    lashes out.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Two people have died on this<br>
    ship... two lives that ended,<br>
    horribly... and you're worried<br>
    about your tennis game?</p>
  <p> Guinan hears the heat in Beverly's voice... sees her<br>
    flushed cheeks and blazing eyes. Guinan looks<br>
    surprisingly satisfied.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Doctor... are you angry?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Angry? For two hours, I've poured<br>
    my heart out to you... and all you<br>
    care about is your elbow. You bet<br>
    I'm angry!</p>

    Do... ?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    For two hours you've been moping<br>
    around, feeling sorry for<br>
    yourself...</p>
  <p> Guinan advances on her, drilling into her.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    If you're angry -- maybe you'll<br>
    stop moping and do something.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've already tried everything I<br>
    could think of, and it's only made<br>
    things worse.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Do you think Reyga killed himself?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Do you think there's a murderer on<br>
    the Enterprise?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Then why are you standing here?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm in enough trouble already. If<br>
    I start digging into this again --</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    That's right. You could be<br>
    relieved of duty.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>32 INT. SHUTTLEBAY</p>
  <p> Beverly ENTERS and crosses to the shuttle. She reacts<br>
    at the sight of the open rear doors... looks inside...</p>
  <p>33 INT. SHUTTLE</p>
  <p> Data is inside, working at the console. Beverly ENTERS<br>
    the shuttle.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Data... what are you doing here?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am running additional<br>
    diagnostics to make certain there<br>
    was no permanent radiation damage<br>
    to the shuttlecraft hull.</p>
  <p> Beverly sits with him at the console...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Data, you've studied Doctor<br>
    Reyga's shield system. Tell me --<br>
    do you think it could've been<br>
    sabotaged?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There was no evidence to suggest<br>
    sabotage.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Just consider the possibility...</p>
  <p> Data considers.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The system interlocks prevent<br>
    access to the circuitry unless the<br>
    shield emitter is active. Any<br>
    attempt to sabotage the device<br>
    would have to be made while the<br>
    shield was in operation.</p>

  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The only time the shield was<br>
    active was during Jo'Bril's test<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct. It seems<br>
    unlikely that Jo'Bril would<br>
    perform sabotage which would<br>
    result in his own death.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I agree.<br>

    Would it be possible to sabotage<br>
    the shuttle by remote, during the<br>
    flight?</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    A phased ionic pulse beamed<br>
    directly into the metaphasic<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Where on the Enterprise could you<br>
    generate a phased ionic pulse?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Such a pulse could be initiated<br>
    from the lateral sensor arrays,<br>

    sixteen, or any of the bridge<br>

  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    someone did send out a phased<br>
    ionic pulse... what would've<br>
    happened inside the shuttle?</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Beverly...</p>
  <p> She turns, but keeps walking. He joins her.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've made arrangements for a<br>
    shuttle to Starbase twenty-three.<br>
    You can leave at oh-seven-hundred<br>
    hours tomorrow.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> A brief beat as they walk.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sorry about all this... I'm<br>
    sure it will all work out fine.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The inquiry is only a formality...<br>
    you know the Captain will support<br>
    you all he can.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That will help.</p>

  <p> Another silence... then Riker steps in front of her,<br>
    stopping her.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But... if you do anything...<br>
    foolish... before the inquiry...<br>
    that wouldn't look so good.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't know what you're talking<br>
    about. What you mean...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think you do. The smartest<br>
    thing you can do right now is to<br>
    stay in your quarters and read a<br>
    good book. Because if you make<br>
    this situation any worse -- it'll<br>
    be that much harder on you.</p>
  <p> Beverly holds his look firmly, unflinching.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Thank you, Commander. Your<br>
    concern is noted --</p>
  <p> She turns to go. Riker takes her gently by the arm,<br>
    stopping her.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Beverly... I'm saying this as a<br>
    friend.</p>
  <p> Beverly blinks -- and softens. She knows he's right...<br>

    speaks gently.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I know, Wil... thank you.<br>

    But... as a friend... please try<br>
    to understand. I can't quit now.<br>

  <p>34A INT. SICKBAY - BEVERLY'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Beverly is at her desk terminal, holding a PADD. In<br>

  <p> Ogawa glances at the terminal screen.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    What do you need the autopsy files<br>
    for?</p>
  <p> Beverly has no desire to get Ogawa in trouble. Beverly<br>
    turns off the terminal.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Don't worry. I know I'm not<br>
    supposed to be here... I'll go...</p>
  <p> Ogawa takes a long, hard look at Beverly. Then Ogawa<br>
    moves to the terminal, turns it back on, and begins to<br>
    work it herself.</p>

    Too bad you're not my boss any<br>

    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Ogawa smiles.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    So what do we need to do?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    First, I want to review Jo'Bril's<br>
    physiology records... and then I<br>
    want to take another look at his<br>
    body. I need to see if there's<br>
    any evidence of tetryon traces.</p>

    over the body as it comes to a rest.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We'll have to run a tissue scan at<br>
    the molecular level. Calibrate<br>
    the scanner to detect tetryon<br>

  <p> Ogawa fiddles with the device.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Re-calibration complete.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Okay. Activate the scan.</p>
  <p> Ogawa pushes the controls... there's an audible HUM as<br>
    the scan begins. Beverly and Ogawa study the monitor<br>
    as the scan continues... Then the computer BEEPS and<br>
    the HUM STOPS -- the scan is complete.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Nothing...</p>

    (beat; thinks)<br>
    Let's try it again. Use the<br>
    enhanced resolution mode to boost<br>
    the sensitivity.</p>
  <p> Ogawa adjusts the scanner controls. The scan HUMS<br>
    again... then...</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    (off monitor)<br>
    Look... in the subdermal tissue...<br>
    tetryon traces...</p>
  <p> Beverly steps back, mystified.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    So someone did sabotage the<br>
    shield...</p>
  <p> Ogawa is not convinced.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    That's a possibility... but this<br>
    is very circumstantial evidence.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, a thought sparks in Beverly's mind -- her<br>
    expression changes to one of grim determination. She<br>

    Move away.</p>
  <p> Beverly steps away from the console. Jo'Bril starts<br>
    working the controls.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What are you doing?</p>
  <p> JO'BRIL<br>
    I'm sending out a transient<br>
    subspace signal. It will obscure<br>
    the shuttle from the Enterprise<br>
    sensors... and they will interpret<br>
    it as a warp engine breach.<br>
    They'll believe that you've been<br>
    destroyed.</p>
  <p> As he works --</p>
  <p> JO'BRIL<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'd like to thank you, Doctor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    For what?</p>
  <p> JO'BRIL<br>
    All I wanted to do was discredit<br>
    Reyga so no one would pursue his<br>
    technology except me. But you've<br>
    given me more than I could've<br>
    hoped...</p>
  <p> Beverly eyes the shuttle's main panel, her mind<br>
    racing... looking for a way out of the situation. She<br>
    edges closer to the panel.</p>
  <p> JO'BRIL<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Now I can take the prototype back<br>
    to Takara... where I will develop<br>
    it into a weapon.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    All I have to do is wait here<br>
    until the Enterprise is convinced<br>
    you're dead... and leaves.</p>
  <p> Beverly lunges for the controls and forcefully alters<br>
    the setting. The shuttle ROCKS violently and Beverly<br>
    and Jo'Bril are thrown to the floor --</p>

  <p> Beverly manages to grab the phaser, but Jo'Bril tackles<br>
    her and they struggle for control. Beverly delivers a<br>
    vicious punch to his throat... then KICKS him away.</p>
  <p> Jo'Bril staggers back. Beverly tries to take aim with<br>
    the phaser, but the shaking makes it difficult. The<br>
    WHITE LIGHT outside the windows FILLS the shuttle,<br>
    blinding.</p>

    quickly recovers, standing to reveal there is a GAPING<br>
    HOLE IN HIS CHEST -- WE CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH IT.</p>
  <p> Jo'Bril reacts, as if equally surprised by the sight.<br>
    He looks up at Beverly, eyes ablaze, angry -- and he<br>
    keeps coming. Beverly FIRES a long, continuous BURST<br>
    at Jo'Bril -- and he VAPORIZES into thin air.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY (V.O.)<br>
    Chief Medical Officer's log,<br>
    Stardate 46831.2. I have been<br>
    reinstated and will be resuming my<br>
    duties shortly. In the meantime,<br>
    I have a personal matter to attend<br>
    to.</p>
  <p>60A INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Guinan is behind the bar... there are just a few people<br>
    in the room. Beverly ENTERS carrying a nicely wrapped<br>
    package, and heads for the bar.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Hello, Guinan.</p>
  <p> She sets the package on the bar, and Guinan eyes it.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Somebody's birthday?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not unless it's yours.<br>
    (gesturing to package)<br>
    This is for you.</p>
  <p> Guinan smiles appreciatively... she does enjoy<br>
    surprises.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    For me? What's the occasion?</p>
  <p> She begins opening the present.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suspicions&quot; - REV. 03/01/93 - ACT FIVE 58B.</p>
  <p>60A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's a thank you. For giving me<br>
    a good kick in the butt.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    But... I didn't.</p>
  <p> She reaches into the package... lifts out a FUTURISTIC<br>
    TENNIS RACQUET.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I did a little research... this is<br>
    the latest design... state of the<br>
    art... and it's specially<br>
    cushioned to absorb vibration --<br>
    so you'll never have to worry<br>
    about tennis elbow again.</p>
  <p> Guinan is turning the racquet over in her hands,<br>
    inspecting it. But then she hands it back to Beverly.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Thank you, Doctor... it looks like<br>
    a great racquet. But you see...<br>
    I don't play tennis. Never have.</p>
  <p> She smiles impishly at Beverly... who takes the<br>
    racquet, first nonplussed... and then understanding<br>
    that the whole thing was Guinan's very special kind of<br>
    friendship. Off their looks --</p>

  <p> ADDED DIALOGUE, SCENE 5, UNDER BEVERLY'S V.O. 'S:</p>
  <p> KURAK<br>
    I, for one, came here only at the<br>
    request of my government. I am<br>
    highly dubious that this so-called<br>
    metaphasic shield technology will<br>
    prove anything but a fantasy.</p>
  <p> T'PAN<br>
    Since everything Doctor Reyga says<br>
    contradicts the work I have been<br>
    doing in subspace shielding, I<br>
    will have to be convinced that he<br>
    is credible.</p>
  <p> CHRISTOPHER<br>
    My wife is right. We feel the<br>
    concept itself is flawed. But we<br>
    will admit to a kind of curiosity<br>
    about it.</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Jo'Bril should say nothing)</p>
