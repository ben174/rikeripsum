  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is dropping out of warp.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 46071.6.<br>
    We have been called to the aid<br>
    of a transport ship, which has<br>
    been attacked near Rekag-Seronia.<br>
    Hostilities between the two factions<br>
    on that planet have intensified<br>
    recently, threatening an important<br>
    Federation shipping route.</p>
  <p>2 OMITTED</p>
  <p>2A INT. MAIN BRIDGE - (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD, WORF, DATA, RIKER, TROI, SUPERNUMERARIES as<br>
    needed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, sensors have located the<br>
    transport ship. Two Rekag battle<br>
    cruisers are flanking it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Red alert. Shields up.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Phasers on line. Photon torpedoes<br>
    armed and ready.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is the transport still under<br>
    attack?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The cruisers' weapons are powered<br>
    up... but...</p>
  <p> He observes something new on the console.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - 7/24/92 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, the Rekag ships are turning<br>
    and heading out of sensor range.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They don't want to take on the<br>
    Enterprise...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We are within visual range of the<br>
    transport, Sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p> We see the disabled Transport, Dorian.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sensors indicate damage to the<br>
    Dorian's sub space emitters.<br>
    Audio communication only.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Open a channel, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard<br>
    of the Federation starship<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> The Dorian Captain replies... but the transmission<br>
    isn't good... staticky, tending to break up.</p>
  <p> TALMADGE'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain Talmadge of the Dorian.<br>
    Glad you're here... we took some<br>
    shield damage from the Rekag<br>
    ships... but we couldn't have held<br>
    out if they attacked again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you have injuries? Can we<br>
    assist you in any way?</p>
  <p> TALMADGE'S COM VOICE<br>
    No injuries... but I'd like<br>
    permission to transport a couple<br>
    of guests to your ship.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - REV. 7/27/92 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course...</p>
  <p> TALMADGE'S COM VOICE<br>
    We're conveying a mediator to<br>
    Seronia. I think he's the reason<br>
    the Rekags fired on us...</p>
  <p> Now Talmadge really begins to break up.</p>
  <p> TALMADGE'S COM VOICE<br>
    ...travelling... negotiations...</p>
  <p> Picard shakes his head in frustration.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain, I'm losing you. Go ahead<br>
    and beam your passengers on<br>
    board...</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Troi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor, will you see to our<br>
    guests' needs and then escort them<br>
    to my Ready Room.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes, Captain.</p>
  <p> Troi heads for the Turbolift.</p>
  <p>2B INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Troi ENTERS the Transporter Room. The Transporter<br>
    TECHNICIAN works the console and AMBASSADOR ALKAR and<br>
    his mother MAYLOR MATERIALIZE.</p>
  <p> Alkar is in his 30's, very attractive. His serenity<br>
    is contrasted by a deep sense of purpose.</p>
  <p> Maylor is an ancient woman, with white hair, craggy<br>
    face, and stooped back. But there is a deeper power<br>
    that emanates from her that is intense -- and<br>
    disquieting. She simmers with rage, and while she is<br>
    not loud or grating, there is a malignancy which<br>
    permeates every word she speaks. She looks right at<br>
    Troi.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm Counselor Deanna Troi.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - REV. 7/28/92 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>2B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Alkar steps down, hand extended.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Ambassador Ves Alkar...<br>
    (gestures)<br>
    ... and my mother, Sev Maylor.<br>
    Counselor, it's imperative that<br>
    I speak with your Captain...</p>
  <p> Before Troi can answer, Maylor comes off the stage,<br>
    moves right toward her, locks on and drills into her.</p>
  <p> MAYLOR<br>
    You think he's attracted to you...<br>
    but he isn't. You offer him<br>
    nothing...</p>
  <p> There is a brief, stunned silence. Alkar moves<br>
    smoothly in, takes Maylor's arm.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    She hasn't been well. Could she<br>
    be taken to quarters?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Of course.<br>
    (to Transporter Chief)<br>
    Chief...<br>
    (to Alkar)<br>
    I'll take you to meet Captain<br>
    Picard...</p>
  <p> The Transporter Chief moves toward Maylor. Alkar<br>
    addresses Maylor, nodding toward the Chief.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Go with him...</p>
  <p> Maylor accedes, walks toward the door... but stops and<br>
    looks back at Troi.</p>
  <p> MAYLOR<br>
    Don't pursue him. I won't have<br>
    it... I'll stop you...</p>
  <p> The Transporter Chief eases her out the door. Alkar<br>
    looks apologetically at Troi.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>A3 OMITTED</p>
  <p>A4 INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard and Alkar are talking with Starfleet ADMIRAL<br>
    SIMONS who is on the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    (with some urgency)<br>
    I am grateful for the<br>
    Federation's offer to escort me,<br>
    but if I arrive at Rekag-Seronia<br>
    on the Enterprise, the armed<br>
    Flagship of Starfleet, my mission<br>
    as a Peace negotiator will be<br>
    compromised. There must be a<br>
    Federation transport ship in the<br>
    area that could take me there.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    With all due respect, Admiral<br>
    -- to put the Ambassador on<br>
    another unarmed transport will<br>
    only invite a second assault.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    I believe the attack on us was<br>
    an isolated incident, nothing<br>
    more...</p>
  <p> The Admiral pauses, taking in both sides, then --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - REV. 7/28/92 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p>A4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL<br>
    Ambassador Alkar... the<br>
    Rekag-Seronia dispute has<br>
    threatened Federation ships for<br>
    many months. We are grateful that<br>
    you are willing to undertake this<br>
    mission... and you have our full<br>
    support.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL<br>
    However, we also recognize that<br>
    safety is an issue -- not just<br>
    yours, but the crew that escorts<br>
    you. To send you on an unarmed<br>
    transport puts everyone at risk.<br>
    I think it's best if you proceed to<br>
    Rekag-Seronia aboard the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - REV. 7/28/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>A4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> There is a hesitation... Alkar doesn't agree, but<br>
    acquiesces.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Then I have no choice.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL<br>
    Once you get to Rekag-Seronia,<br>
    you may conduct your negotiations<br>
    as you see fit. Until then --<br>
    you'll be in good hands with<br>
    Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> The message of the speech is not lost on Alkar, who<br>
    smiles. Even when he's in disagreement, nothing seems<br>
    to ruffle him.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    ... I understand.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SIMONS<br>
    Good luck, and a successful<br>
    journey.</p>
  <p> The Admiral disappears from the Viewscreen. Picard<br>
    looks at Alkar, then--</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard to Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yes, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Set a course for Seronia.</p>
  <p>4 INT. GYM</p>
  <p> A soft-form martial arts class is in progress (like<br>
    the one in &quot;Clues&quot;); the group wears a form of gi.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - REV. 7/27/92 - ACT ONE 8A.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf leads it; Troi is participating -- and Alkar.<br>
    Alkar's skill is evident in the way he moves.</p>
  <p> At one point, Troi looks over and smiles at him.</p>
  <p> Worf completes the final move, then --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That is all for today. There will<br>
    be another class tomorrow at<br>
    oh-seven-hundred hours.</p>
  <p> The group moves off in casual clusters. Troi finds<br>
    herself face to face with Alkar.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The skills are demanding...<br>
    You're very disciplined.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - REV. 7/27/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    I believe in a strong connection<br>
    between body and mind.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You obviously share that<br>
    conviction.</p>
  <p> She smiles at him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes... Only sometimes I have a<br>
    problem getting my body to conform<br>
    to my mind's wishes...</p>
  <p> He laughs and they EXIT frame.</p>
  <p>4A INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as they come from the gym.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I would imagine that your<br>
    self-discipline helps you in your<br>
    work...</p>
  <p> He shrugs and smiles in a self-deprecating way.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    I don't know about that... I think<br>
    maybe my biggest asset is<br>
    patience.</p>
  <p> She gives him a questioning look.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    I let everybody else talk until<br>
    they're exhausted... then when<br>
    I start, they're too tired to<br>
    argue.</p>
  <p> She smiles at that.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're going to need all your<br>
    patience at Seronia... I can't<br>
    imagine how you'll get the two<br>
    sides talking to each other...</p>
  <p> Again, his modest smile.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - REV. 7/27/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>4A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Neither can I. I won't know that<br>
    until I get there. I tend to feel<br>
    my way through a situation...</p>
  <p> They have reached a Turbolift, and ENTER it.</p>
  <p>4B INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Deck nine. If I were empathic,<br>
    like you... I'd have a real<br>
    advantage.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I thought Lumerians were<br>
    empathic...</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Only with each other, not other<br>
    species. So... I don't have any<br>
    idea what you might be feeling<br>
    just now...</p>
  <p> She thinks, smiles to herself.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Curiosity...<br>
    (off his look)<br>
    What I sense from you is very<br>
    unusual. Serenity... calmness...<br>
    tranquility... you seem to embody<br>
    the very qualities you hope to<br>
    draw out in others.</p>
  <p> The Turbolift doors open and they EXIT.</p>
  <p>5 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Tell me, Counselor... have you<br>
    ever been involved in diplomatic<br>
    negotiations?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Several times... with Captain<br>
    Picard. There've been instances<br>
    when having an empath along has<br>
    been helpful.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - REV. 7/28/92 - ACT ONE 10A.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    I'm sure.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I could use some of that help.<br>
    Would you come with me when we<br>
    reach Seronia?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If the Captain authorizes it, of<br>
    course I will.</p>
  <p> They have reached his quarters.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    I hope to see you again.</p>
  <p> She smiles in response, and turns to head up the<br>
    corridor. But suddenly the door OPENS -- and there<br>
    stands Maylor, quietly furious, eyes blazing.</p>
  <p> MAYLOR<br>
    You're late.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Mother, I told you I would be gone<br>
    for over an hour...</p>
  <p> MAYLOR<br>
    You're late because of her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - 7/24/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> She turns to Troi, and once again, her ancient,<br>
    glittering eyes bore into Troi like malevolent lasers.</p>
  <p> MAYLOR<br>
    Have you mated with him yet?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What --?</p>
  <p> MAYLOR<br>
    That's what you want, isn't it?</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Mother, come in, please --</p>
  <p> But Maylor moves toward Troi, who instinctively moves<br>
    back.</p>
  <p> MAYLOR<br>
    I can always tell. The ones with<br>
    a certain look in their eye...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'd better go...</p>
  <p> Alkar takes his mother's arm, restraining her from<br>
    moving in to Troi, but the venom of her words is<br>
    unstoppable.</p>
  <p> MAYLOR<br>
    I'll tell you this... if you do,<br>
    you will regret it for the rest<br>
    of your life...</p>
  <p> Troi shrinks back from the woman, obviously sensing<br>
    deeply the malevolence that permeates her.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Come on, Mother... you need to<br>
    lie down...</p>
  <p> He pulls the woman toward the room, her gaze still<br>
    locked intently on Troi's. He gives Troi a helpless<br>
    glance.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    I'll see you later...</p>
  <p> Troi nods and the strange duo disappear into the<br>
    quarters. Troi takes several deep breaths, trying to<br>
    calm herself.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - REV. 7/28/92 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>5A INT. TROI'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> The chime SOUNDS.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> The door opens and Riker ENTERS, carrying a Padd.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hi. It's that time again...</p>
  <p> She looks at him, perplexed. She's still distracted by<br>
    the incident with Maylor. Riker lifts the Padd.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    I'm sorry, Ambassador.</p>

    anger in his voice.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    You communicate distrust... you<br>
    announce your warlike intentions.<br>
    It's not the way to enter into<br>
    peace negotiations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I must take the necessary<br>
    precautions. One ship you were<br>
    on has already been attacked.<br>

    And I think you'd agree that a<br>
    dead man cannot be a particularly<br>
    effective negotiator.</p>
  <p> This gets a rise from Alkar... he stifles the instinct<br>

    gazes at her for a moment. Then, slowly, he reaches<br>
    out and touches his stone to hers. They both GLOW<br>
    warmly for a brief instant, then die out. He pulls<br>
    his hands away. Troi opens her eyes and he smiles at<br>
    her. Alkar is relieved... calm and composed.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    Captain's Log, Stardate 46073.6.<br>
    We have arrived without incident<br>
    at Seronia, where two members of<br>
    Ambassador Alkar's delegation have<br>
    been waiting. They have joined<br>
    us to report on the situation in<br>
    the capital city.</p>
  <p>25 OMITTED</p>
  <p>25A INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Alkar and Picard are with JARTH, a heavy-set man in his<br>
    mid-fifties, and LIVA, a lovely woman in her thirties,<br>
    with the delicate features of a porcelain doll. There<br>
    is a map displayed on the monitor. Jarth addresses<br>
    both Picard and Alkar.</p>
  <p> JARTH<br>
    Things have deteriorated<br>
    steadily. Rekag sympathizers in<br>
    outlying districts have attacked<br>
    several towns.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was under the impression there<br>
    was a cease fire agreement.</p>
  <p> JARTH<br>
    It was broken before it went into<br>
    effect. A Rekag shuttle strayed<br>
    into Seronian space and was<br>
    destroyed by fighter craft.</p>
  <p> LIVA<br>
    Naturally the Rekags retaliated...<br>
    there's been fighting ever since.</p>
  <p> But instead of reflecting the concern and anxiety<br>
    evident on the face of his colleagues, Alkar's attitude<br>
    is if anything more serene.</p>

  <p>25A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    If they will just sit down with<br>
    me...</p>
  <p> JARTH<br>
    The Rekags have refused to come<br>
    to Seronian territory for talks.<br>
    And the Seronians won't go to<br>
    Rekag. In the meantime -- they<br>
    fight.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ambassador... the situation sounds<br>
    volatile. Perhaps a cooling off<br>
    period --</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    These people need an end to the<br>
    fighting now -- to delay a week,<br>
    or even a few days, could cost<br>
    thousands of lives.</p>
  <p> Picard moves to the map on the monitor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then I recommend asking both sides<br>
    if they will agree to meet at the<br>
    coastal city of Darthen.</p>
  <p> Alkar looks at him for a beat; he's impressed with<br>
    Picard's knowledge of the situation.</p>
  <p> LIVA<br>
    Why Darthen?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It has been neutral throughout the<br>
    conflict. Both Seronians and Rekag<br>
    loyalists live there. It might be<br>
    acceptable as a compromise.</p>
  <p> Alkar considers Picard's proposal for a beat, then --</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Contact the leaders. If they will<br>
    meet in Darthen, I will join them<br>
    there tomorrow.</p>

  <p> Troi is with ENSIGN JANEWAY, a young woman from the<br>
    science department, who is very distraught.</p>
  <p> ENSIGN JANEWAY<br>
    ... I know it must be my<br>
    imagination... but it seems as<br>
    though Lieutenant Pinder just --<br>
    doesn't want me in his section.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why do you think that?</p>
  <p> ENSIGN JANEWAY<br>
    He's so critical... I can't ever<br>
    do anything to please him... and<br>
    I try, Counselor, I try to make<br>
    sure there's nothing he could find<br>
    fault with...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Give me an example of what you<br>
    mean.</p>
  <p> ENSIGN JANEWAY<br>
    Well, yesterday I was running<br>
    routine diagnostics on the sensor<br>
    pallets. They checked out...<br>
    but Lieutenant Pinder questioned<br>
    me because I'd allowed a point<br>
    oh-two-three variance. That's<br>
    well within specifications.<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    He goes out of his way to<br>
    criticize me.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Do you know of any reason why he<br>
    might do that?</p>
  <p> ENSIGN JANEWAY<br>
    No... that's why I'm here.</p>

    Pardon me... ?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm certainly tired of it. How<br>
    do you think it feels to sit and<br>
    listen to someone whine about<br>
    themselves all the time?</p>
  <p> ENSIGN JANEWAY<br>

    This isn't Starfleet Academy.<br>
    You aren't going to be coddled.<br>
    If you can't take it here, you<br>
    might think about a transport<br>
    ship. There's a lot less pressure<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> Ensign Janeway is devastated... but trying to comport<br>
    herself professionally.</p>
  <p> ENSIGN JANEWAY<br>
    I love being on the Enterprise...<br>
    I don't want to be anywhere<br>
    else...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

    But if you aren't up to it... you<br>
    don't deserve to be here. Isn't<br>
    that right?</p>
  <p> ENSIGN JANEWAY<br>

    Here we go... Bio-filter log<br>
    on Sev Maylor...</p>
  <p> A monitor displays the Transporter bio filter log for<br>
    Alkar's mother. Beverly compares it to the information<br>
    on her tricorder.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Geordi, could this log have been<br>
    damaged in any way... ?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I doubt it. Why do you ask?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There's a discrepancy between the<br>
    log... and the tricorder readings<br>
    I took just three days later.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks again at her tricorder. She's puzzled.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The tricorder shows massive<br>
    physiological deterioration<br>
    compared to her condition when<br>
    she beamed aboard. It's hard to<br>
    believe so much damage could have<br>
    occurred in such a short time.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well... I could run a diagnostic<br>
    of the bio-filter system. And<br>
    your tricorder.</p>
  <p> Beverly hands him her Tricorder, but she doesn't expect<br>
    much from the test.</p>

  <p> Her hair is now done up in a more severe style which<br>

    her entire bearing is more openly seductive and<br>
    aggressive than we've ever seen in Troi. Her makeup<br>

    All right, Deanna... just what<br>
    the hell is going on?</p>
  <p> Troi smiles seductively. She moves toward him, eyes<br>

    (to Security Guards)<br>
    Take her to Sickbay.</p>
  <p> The guards and Riker move a still-struggling Troi to<br>
    the door. Alkar and his party, visibly shaken, stand<br>
    staring, not certain whether to continue the mission.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Captain... perhaps we should delay<br>
    transporting to the surface.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to them... deeply concerned about Troi...<br>
    but realizing the matter at hand can't be ignored.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No... I think you must proceed<br>
    with your mission.</p>

    Very well.</p>

    Yes, Doctor.</p>
  <p> Ogawa pushes something to activate a flow of medication<br>

    I have performed an autopsy on<br>
    Alkar's mother. But instead of<br>
    answering our questions, the<br>
    results have created an even<br>
    deeper mystery.</p>
  <p>42 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> as Beverly and Picard ENTER from the Bridge, in<br>
    mid-conversation.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't have any explanation for<br>
    this, Captain... but when I<br>
    examined Maylor's body... I found<br>
    that her heart, her lungs, her<br>
    skeletal structure... most of the<br>
    systems in her body... were those<br>
    of a thirty-year-old.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How could that be? We both saw<br>
    the woman.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And that's not all. I compared<br>
    Maylor and Alkar's DNA. I don't<br>

    she was definitely not his mother.</p>
  <p> Picard is troubled by these revelations.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Deanna's condition is<br>

  <p> Picard is alone in the room with Alkar. Alkar speaks<br>
    of Troi and Maylor calmly, matter of factly, as if he<br>
    were talking about pieces of machinery.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    No, she wasn't my mother.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And she wasn't ninety-three years<br>
    old.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Captain -- did you perform an<br>
    autopsy against my wishes?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, and for very good reason.<br>
    Deanna Troi is in Sickbay dying.<br>
    Doctor Crusher doesn't know the<br>
    cause of her condition.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I believe you do.</p>
  <p> Alkar regards Picard calmly... but before he can reply,<br>
    Liva ENTERS from the conference chambers and crosses<br>
    to them.</p>

  <p> LIVA<br>
    Alkar... we need you. The Rekags<br>

    talks.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    I'll be right there.</p>
  <p> LIVA<br>
    But --</p>
  <p> Alkar raises a hand to silence her. She looks at<br>
    Picard disapprovingly, then EXITS. Alkar turns back<br>
    to Picard... wants to help him understand.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    They've been arguing for hours<br>
    in there. It seems hopeless.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But now -- when expectations are<br>
    lowest -- is the moment I can be<br>
    most effective. If I am focused...<br>
    centered... free of disquieting<br>
    thoughts... I can turn these<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not particularly interested<br>
    in your techniques as a mediator<br>
    --</p>

  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Hear me out, Captain. It's<br>
    important that you understand.<br>

    You see, I discovered long ago<br>
    that I had the ability to channel<br>
    my darker thoughts... my unwanted<br>

    me unencumbered.</p>
  <p> Picard stares at him... realization dawning.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is this... what you've done to<br>
    Counselor Troi?</p>
  <p> Alkar shrugs, still matter of fact.</p>

  <p>45 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    I didn't plan it. I expected<br>
    Maylor to live through this<br>
    negotiation. Her death could not<br>
    have been more untimely.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then... you deliberately began<br>
    using Deanna...</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    She's an empath. I was reasonably<br>
    certain I could establish a link<br>
    with her.<br>

    Frankly, I was amazed when I saw<br>
    how quickly she was aging.<br>

  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Come now, Captain -- surely you<br>
    can see there is a broader canvas<br>
    here. If I came to these peace<br>
    talks hindered by unwanted<br>
    emotions... the Rekags and<br>
    Seronians would be condemned to<br>
    go on fighting...</p>
  <p> But Picard is having none of this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, Alkar... you can't explain<br>
    away a wantonly immoral act just<br>
    because you think it's connected<br>
    to some higher purpose.</p>
  <p> Alkar steps toward him, challenging.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Do you know how many people have<br>
    died on this planet in the last<br>
    forty eight hours? Thousands.<br>
    (beat)<br>

  <p>45 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And you think that justifies<br>
    brutalizing her? And the others<br>
    you've used?</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Ask the Seronian and Rekag<br>
    children who go to sleep every<br>
    night in fear of their lives.</p>
  <p> Alkar has no doubts about his position, no nagging<br>
    moral concerns which ask him to consider another side.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Captain... I get no payment for<br>
    what I do. I have no power base,<br>
    no agenda. I am willing to risk<br>
    my life simply to help others.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you think you appear<br>
    courageous, you're mistaken.<br>
    You're a coward. You exploit the<br>
    innocent so you don't have to<br>
    shoulder the burden of unpleasant<br>
    emotions.</p>
  <p> Picard moves toward Alkar, drilling into him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This time you will be held<br>

  <p> Alkar and Liva, accompanied by Worf, ENTER. Alkar's<br>
    anxiety has increased slightly and he is no longer the<br>
    serene diplomat we've seen previously. He stops short<br>
    once he sees...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - REV. 7/29/92 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>53 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Beverly is just removing a medical device from Troi's<br>
    forehead. Troi now looks ghastly... she has aged as<br>
    far as did Maylor when she died. A clearly<br>
    grief-stricken Riker is standing near Picard who looks<br>
    grim. Beverly's voice is bitter as she looks up at<br>
    Alkar.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Computer, note in the log that<br>
    death occurred at fourteen thirty<br>
    hours... due to respiratory and<br>
    renal failure.</p>
  <p> Alkar looks shaken by the news... he takes a beat, then<br>
    turns to Liva, who is concerned about the way he's<br>
    taking this.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Will you wait for me in my<br>
    quarters?</p>
  <p> LIVA<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> She EXITS. Alkar moves to Troi's lifeless body under<br>
    the icy stares of the others. The bio monitors in the<br>
    room all show flatlines.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    It is a tragic loss. But her<br>
    death had a purpose.</p>
  <p> Picard moves toward him, speaks in a steely voice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I intend to make certain that<br>
    you answer for what you have<br>
    done.</p>
  <p> Alkar feels certain Picard can do nothing.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Your own Federation Council has<br>
    granted me safe and timely passage<br>
    to my planet. I expect you to<br>
    honor that.</p>
  <p> He EXITS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - REV. 7/29/92 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The second the doors shut behind Alkar there is an<br>
    immediate change of atmosphere in the room as their<br>
    grief is replaced with a drive toward action. Beverly<br>
    whirls around and pulls out a tricorder to scan Troi.<br>
    Riker and Picard move to her side, while Ogawa readies<br>
    several medical instruments and hyposprays.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How much longer do we have?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Three minutes, forty seconds...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard to Transporter Room Two...<br>
    lock on to the young woman in<br>
    Ambassador Alkar's quarters...<br>
    stand by to transport her out<br>
    of there.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Worf.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, station yourself<br>
    outside the quarters.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> He moves toward the exit.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - REV. 7/30/92 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>54 INT. ALKAR'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> He moves to the couch, looks at her, his shaky emotions<br>
    once more put forth as a grief response.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    She'd helped me so much... without<br>
    her, I couldn't have accomplished<br>
    what I did...</p>
  <p> Her response is genuinely sympathetic.</p>
  <p> LIVA<br>
    I'm so sorry... Is there anything<br>
    I can do...</p>
  <p> His eyes meet hers... full of pain and need. He gets<br>
    up.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Yes, there is something...</p>
  <p> Alkar get the meditation box, returns to her, sets it<br>
    down between them.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    If we could share the funeral<br>
    meditation...</p>
  <p>55 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Beverly, Ogawa, checking Troi's lifesigns and getting<br>
    ready to revive her.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We have a minute and a half<br>
    left...<br>
    (to Ogawa)<br>
    Prepare a hypospray of cordrazine.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Yes, Doctor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We'll use that in conjunction with<br>
    the cortical stimulator...</p>
  <p> Ogawa moves to prepare the necessary items. Riker,<br>
    still stationed by Troi's side, looks on worriedly.</p>
  <p>56 INT. ALKAR'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Liva and Alkar hold the stones... Alkar's eyes are<br>
    closed... he begins the meditation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - REV. 7/29/92 - ACT FIVE 58A.</p>
  <p>56 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    Rohm gah... sevi rohm... rohm<br>
    gah...</p>
  <p> LIVA<br>
    Rohm gah... sevi rohm... rohm<br>
    gah...</p>

  <p>56A INT SICKBAY</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We can't wait any longer.<br>
    (to Ogawa)<br>
    Release the stasis field. Ten<br>
    cc's of cordrazine.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Yes, doctor.</p>
  <p> Ogawa releases the field, administers the hypospray.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Cortical stimulator...</p>
  <p> Ogawa places the cortical stimulator on Troi's<br>
    forehead.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Now.</p>
  <p> Troi's body stiffens as an electrical charge is<br>
    introduced into her body.</p>
  <p>56B INT. ALKAR'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> as before.</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    ... an end to pain...</p>
  <p> LIVA<br>
    ... an end to pain...</p>
  <p>57 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> as before.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Again.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - REV. 7/30/92 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>57 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Ogawa works the device and Troi's body stiffens<br>
    again... there is a beat, then she gasps slightly...<br>
    and starts to breathe.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    She has a pulse... blood pressure<br>
    climbing... ninety over forty.</p>
  <p> Riker looks relieved as he realizes Troi is coming<br>
    back.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    All right... let's neutralize the<br>
    neuro-transmitters. Initiate the<br>
    decontamination sequence...</p>
  <p> Ogawa activates another device. A beat and then --</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Levels are dropping, Doctor...<br>
    down to four hundred twenty<br>
    percent above normal... three<br>
    hundred eighty percent...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard to Transporter Room<br>
    Three...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Not yet. I won't know for<br>
    certain that it's working until<br>
    we get her below three hundred<br>
    percent.</p>
  <p> Picard nods acquiescence. Troi's eyes flutter open for<br>
    the first time. She draws a deep breath.</p>
  <p>58 INT. ALKAR'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> ALKAR<br>
    ... and courage from wisdom...</p>
  <p> Alkar gasps, suddenly confused... he reaches out and<br>
    grabs Liva.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - REV. 7/29/92 - ACT FIVE 60A.</p>
  <p>59 LIVA</p>
  <p> Is surprised by his action.</p>
  <p> LIVA<br>
    Alkar... what's wrong?</p>
  <p> Then her eyes widen and she stares at him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - REV. 7/30/92 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>60 ALKAR</p>
  <p> Who looks much older. He grabs Liva and refuses to<br>
    let go.</p>
  <p>61 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as before.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Neuro-transmitter levels are down<br>

  <p>62 INT. ALKAR'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Alkar has aged still more. He holds a struggling Liva<br>
    in his grip.</p>
  <p> LIVA<br>
    Let me go!</p>
  <p> Liva manages to pull away from him... he moves to grab<br>
    her again, but then Liva suddenly DEMATERIALIZES and<br>
    Alkar is left clutching at the air. He heads for the<br>
    doors... the doors OPEN and Alkar is confronted by TWO<br>
    N.D. SECURITY OFFICERS standing in the Corridor. Alkar<br>
    steps back, his escape now blocked.</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>63 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As Troi continues to get younger and younger...</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Neuro transmitter level at two<br>
    hundred thirty percent...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - REV. 7/29/92 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Alkar's features deteriorate rapidly...</p>
  <p> Troi finally returns to her normal self and looks<br>
    around the room...</p>
  <p> Alkar becomes an ancient, decrepit, old man... he falls<br>
    to the floor, barely able to breathe... finally<br>
    collapsing in a heap and dies. Worf and the security<br>
    guard stare in amazement at the transformed man at<br>
    their feet. Worf's response is understated,<br>
    simple...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (touches communicator)<br>
    Worf to Captain Picard.<br>
    Ambassador Alkar is dead.</p>
  <p> END INTERCUT.</p>
  <p>64 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Beverly and Picard react to this unexpected news with<br>
    surprise. But Riker cares only about Troi, pale and<br>
    weary, but otherwise just fine. She reaches out for<br>
    his hand.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Wil...</p>
  <p> He holds her hand tight.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>64A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit.</p>
  <p>65 INT. TROI'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Riker with Troi, relaxing with coffee or tea.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Doctor Crusher thinks he must have<br>
    been at a susceptible point in<br>
    the meditation ceremony... when<br>
    he was somehow vulnerable.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Then the flow of negative emotions<br>
    and feelings was reversed somehow --<br>
    and went back to him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Man Of The People&quot; - REV. 7/28/92 - ACT FIVE 63.</p>
  <p>65 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's our guess. And like a man<br>
    with no immune system... he just<br>
    couldn't handle the sudden<br>
    overload...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And... Liva?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    She seems to be fine. He never<br>
    got to the point where he could<br>
    establish a link with her.</p>
  <p> Troi draws a breath... it's been an overwhelming<br>
    experience.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    When I think back on the last few<br>
    days... it's as though I'm looking<br>
    at a Holodeck projection... of<br>
    someone else.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (gentle smile)<br>
    That's kind of how it seemed to<br>
    the rest of us...</p>
  <p> She reaches out and takes his hand.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Thanks for sticking by me.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I always will.<br>
    (wry)<br>
    Even when you're old and grey.</p>
  <p> She grins and he reaches to her and gives her a hug...<br>
    the two hold each other closely, drawing on the<br>
    strength of their friendship.</p>
