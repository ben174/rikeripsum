    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> docked at DEEP SPACE NINE.</p>
  <p> PICARD (v.o.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 46578.4.<br>
    The Enterprise has arrived at<br>
    Station Deep Space Nine, where we<br>
    will assist in the reconstruction<br>
    of the Bajoran aqueduct systems<br>
    damaged during the Cardassian<br>
    occupation.</p>
  <p>2 INT. DS9 - PROMENADE - LOWER LEVEL</p>
  <p> PICARD and BEVERLY come out of an AIRLOCK and begin<br>
    walking down the street, past the storefronts and<br>
    activity. Picard is carrying a briefcase; Beverly has<br>
    a medical kit. Mid-conversation.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I should be finished with the<br>
    water contaminant analysis in a<br>
    few hours. Then I'm going to try<br>
    one of the Holosuites.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I hear they've got a relaxation<br>
    program here from Alture Seven.<br>
    First you get bathed in a protein<br>
    bath... and then a cloud of<br>
    chromal vapor carries you into a<br>
    meditation chamber... You should<br>
    try it.</p>
  <p> Picard sighs at the thought.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm afraid I won't have the time.<br>
    I'll be too busy discussing the<br>
    finer points of water management<br>
    with ten Bajoran bureaucrats.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And they won't be carrying me on<br>
    chromal vapor...</p>
  <p> Beverly smiles. As they ENTER a TURBOLIFT...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - 12/10/92 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 INT. REPLIMAT</p>
  <p> WORF and GEORDI are moving away from the wall of<br>
    replicators, having just made identical plates of FOOD.<br>
    As they head for a table...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (re: food)<br>
    What is this?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Pasta al fiorella -- you'll love<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> They sit down.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'd like to take a look at those<br>
    Ktarian antiques... I hear there's<br>
    a twenty-first century plasma coil --<br>
    in perfect condition.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    First we eat... then we shop.</p>
  <p>4 NEW ANGLE - JAGLOM SHREK</p>
  <p> A thin, creepy-looking ALIEN who is pointedly watching<br>
    Worf from across the street. He slowly starts to make<br>
    his way toward the Replimat. OFF his intent...</p>
  <p>5 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> DATA, RIKER, VARIOUS N.D.s at their positions. A small<br>
    WARNING ALARM sounds on Data's console.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Commander -- I am reading a minor<br>
    power drain in the Starboard EPS<br>
    conduits.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's causing it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (works)<br>
    The problem is originating in<br>
    Sickbay. There has been an<br>
    unauthorized access into the<br>
    computer's bio-imaging systems.</p>
  <p> Riker is not overly concerned, but still...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - REV. 12/10/92 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You'd better check it out.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> Data stands and heads for the Turbolift...</p>
  <p>6 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> JULIAN BASHIR is by himself, working on a TECH DEVICE --<br>
    a large, battered-looking cylinder. The device has<br>
    been connected to a medical console with a small cable.</p>
  <p> Data ENTERS and reacts to the sight of this strange man<br>
    in Sickbay.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Bashir)<br>
    Excuse me. Do you have<br>
    authorization to work in this<br>
    area?</p>
  <p> Bashir glances at Data, missing the question,<br>
    completely absorbed in his work. He waves Data over.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    Come here... come here... I need<br>
    a hand with this field<br>
    generator...</p>
  <p> Data walks over. Bashir touches a control on the<br>
    cylinder, then indicates a medical console.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    See if you can boost the power<br>
    output to sixty-five percent.</p>
  <p> Data looks at the cylinder.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am sorry. Use of Sickbay<br>
    equipment is limited to the ship's<br>
    medical personnel.</p>
  <p> Bashir turns to Data -- offers him a hand.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    Doctor Julian Bashir -- Chief<br>
    Medical officer, Deep Space Nine.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - REV. 12/10/92 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BASHIR (Cont'd)<br>
    (off Data's pips)<br>
    And you are Commander... ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> They shake hands. Bashir reacts to the name...</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    Commander Data... the synthetic<br>
    lifeform?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Bashir smiles, delighted -- shakes Data's hand with<br>
    renewed vigor.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    An honor to meet you, sir. I've<br>
    heard so much about you...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You must have a fascinating<br>
    perspective on bio-cybernetic<br>
    research. I'd be delighted if we<br>
    could discuss the subject<br>
    sometime...</p>
  <p> Bashir's charm catches Data off guard.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I would be happy to do so.<br>
    However, I must ask you to stop<br>
    your experiment.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    Yes, of course... you're right.<br>
    I realize I should have asked<br>
    before using your Sickbay.</p>
  <p> Bashir disconnects the cylinder from the console.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It would've taken me days to<br>
    analyze this device with the<br>
    computer I have on DS Nine...</p>
  <p> Data eyes the cylinder.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - REV. 12/10/92 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What type of device is it?</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    It was discovered in the Gamma<br>
    Quadrant. I think it may be some<br>
    kind of medical instrument.</p>
  <p> Data examines the cylinder.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It appears to employ beam inputs.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I'm hoping it's a medical scanner.<br>
    I want to use your computers to<br>
    find out how it works.</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I suggest we go to Engineering and<br>
    begin with a full circuit pathway<br>
    diagnostic.</p>
  <p> Bashir smiles at the invitation.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    Splendid.</p>
  <p> Data lifts the cylinder. As they head for the door,<br>
    Bashir eyes Data with genuine curiosity.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    I must admit, Commander... I<br>
    didn't think you'd be so...<br>
    personable.</p>
  <p> Data gives him a look. As they EXIT...</p>
  <p>7 INT. DS9 - PROMENADE - REPLIMAT</p>
  <p> Geordi and Worf are sitting at the table. Geordi's<br>
    plate is still full and pushed away from him. Worf<br>
    eats with enthusiasm.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll have to talk to Chief O'Brien<br>
    about the replicators.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - 12/10/92 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI (CONT'D)<br>
    I don't know how you can keep<br>
    eating it...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It tastes like... liquid polymer.</p>
  <p> Worf's plate is almost empty -- he's just finishing.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Delicious.</p>
  <p> Geordi pushes his plate away, stands.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I think I'll try the kiosk on the<br>
    other side of the Promenade. It<br>
    looked like they've got real food.</p>
  <p> Worf nods. Geordi walks off down the Promenade. A<br>
    beat goes by as Worf eats... then:</p>
  <p> SHREK (O.S.)<br>
    Klingon... you are the Starfleet<br>
    Klingon.</p>
  <p> Worf looks toward the voice. INCLUDE Shrek -- the<br>
    alien seen earlier. He is standing near Worf's table.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes... I am Lieutenant Worf.</p>
  <p> SHREK<br>
    Worf... son of Mogh?</p>
  <p> Worf eyes him warily.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What of it?</p>
  <p> Shrek sits down at the table. He leans in close to<br>
    Worf, speaks in a low voice -- manipulative but<br>
    articulate.</p>
  <p> SHREK<br>
    I am Jaglom Shrek. A man with<br>
    information to sell.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You have no information I could<br>
    want.</p>
  <p> SHREK<br>
    I wouldn't be so sure...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - 12/10/92 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Worf is growing annoyed -- he stands to go.</p>
  <p> SHREK<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    It is about your father... Mogh.</p>
  <p> Worf stops, stiffens -- turns to Shrek.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    My father died twenty-five years<br>
    ago at Khitomer.</p>
  <p> Shrek fixes him with a look.</p>
  <p> SHREK<br>
    That is what you believe...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    What if I told you... he is still<br>
    alive?</p>
  <p> OFF Worf's reaction...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - REV. 12/10/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes) </p>
  <p>8 INT. DEEP SPACE NINE - REPLIMAT</p>
  <p> As before, Worf and Shrek. Worf is disbelieving.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    My father is dead.</p>
  <p> SHREK<br>
    He's not. I know where he is.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    How is that possible?</p>
  <p> Shrek leans back in his chair, eyes Worf shrewdly.</p>
  <p> SHREK<br>
    I expect to be paid for my<br>
    information. Perhaps we can<br>
    negotiate an exchange. The<br>
    location of your father, for fifty<br>
    bars of --</p>
  <p> Worf's temper flares -- he GRABS Shrek by the shirt.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (hard)<br>
    Tell me what you know.</p>
  <p> Shrek is shaken, but determined to make a deal.</p>
  <p> SHREK<br>
    Not all of the Klingons at<br>
    Khitomer were killed during the<br>
    massacre. Many were captured by<br>
    the Romulans... and placed in a<br>
    prison camp on a remote planet...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Your father was among them.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Where is this planet?</p>
  <p> SHREK<br>
    Not far from here... I can give<br>
    you the location... for a price.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - REV. 12/10/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf considers. He grows angry.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A Klingon would rather die than be<br>
    taken prisoner. I should kill you<br>
    for spreading lies about my<br>
    family.<br>
    (adamant)<br>
    My father was killed defending<br>
    Khitomer.</p>
  <p> Worf lets go of Shrek, then storms off down the<br>
    Promenade. As Shrek watches him go...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>9 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> docked at DS9.</p>
  <p>10 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Later. RIKER, TROI, N.D.s at their positions. Worf is<br>
    standing at tactical, looking agitated. A SECURITY<br>
    N.D. ENTERS from a Turbolift and crosses to Worf. He<br>
    hands Worf a PADD and turns to go. Worf reads it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to N.D.)<br>
    Ensign Lopez.</p>
  <p> The N.D. turns to Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (snaps)<br>
    This duty roster is unacceptable.<br>
    The assignments must be listed in<br>
    order of priority. Prepare it<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> The hapless N.D. takes the PADD and stares down at it,<br>
    confused by the harsh command.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will expect it no later than oh<br>
    nine hundred hours. Understood?</p>
  <p> The N.D. nods, cowed, and quickly heads for a<br>
    Turbolift. Worf continues working. Riker walks up<br>
    behind Worf at Tactical.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - REV. 12/10/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf, I'll need that rendezvous<br>
    schedule sent over to Commander<br>
    Rudman on the Merrimac as soon as<br>
    you --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (cutting him off)<br>
    I am aware of your request,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts to Worf's abruptness, a little taken<br>
    aback.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lieutenant... are you alright?</p>
  <p> Worf calms himself -- knows he's made a mistake. He's<br>
    on edge, and it shows.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am... fine, sir.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I will send the schedule... Excuse<br>
    me, sir...</p>
  <p> Worf heads for a Turbolift and EXITS. As Riker and<br>
    Troi exchange a concerned look...</p>
  <p>11 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Later. Worf is dressed in his workout uniform,<br>
    practicing his martial arts (as seen in &quot;Man of the<br>
    People&quot;). His motions are slow and deliberate at<br>
    first, as he tries to clear his mind... calming<br>
    himself...</p>
  <p> Gradually, it becomes clear that he is having trouble<br>
    concentrating. His actions grow sharper and faster --<br>
    more violent with emotion. Finally, his anger flares<br>
    and he yells out, SMASHING his arm down onto a table,<br>
    SHATTERING it into several pieces.</p>
  <p> He stands there a moment, breathless, staring at it.<br>
    The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Enter.</p>
  <p> The door OPENS and Troi comes in, takes in the scene --<br>
    sees the broken table.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Did the table do something wrong?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - REV. 12/10/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf is agitated.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm glad you weren't that hard on<br>
    Ensign Lopez.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He made a mistake. The duty<br>
    roster was inaccurate.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (right back at him)<br>
    Would you like to talk about<br>
    what's bothering you... or would<br>
    you like to break some more<br>
    furniture?</p>
  <p> Worf glances at the broken table and manages to calm<br>
    down a little. He takes a breath... this is difficult<br>
    for him to talk about.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Today on the Promenade... I was<br>
    approached by a Yridian. He knew<br>
    who I was... and tried to sell me<br>
    information about... Mogh.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Your father?</p>
  <p> Worf nods grimly.</p>

    My god... could it be true?</p>
  <p> Worf begins to move about the room, restless, his<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    A Klingon would never allow<br>
    himself to be captured. A warrior<br>
    fights to the death.</p>

    If my father were alive... it<br>
    would dishonor his sons and their<br>
    sons for three generations...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Even Alexander would bear the<br>
    burden of guilt.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    So you're willing to ignore the<br>
    possibility... because you're<br>
    concerned about dishonor?</p>
  <p> Worf's anger rushes to the surface.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    My father is dead -- the Yridian<br>
    is selling lies!</p>
  <p> Troi stares at him, unruffled.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If you're so sure of that... why<br>
    are you still upset?</p>
  <p> A long beat. Worf doesn't have an answer.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Worf... you can't deny the<br>
    possibility just because you don't<br>
    want it to be true.</p>
  <p> Worf is silent, fuming, struggling with his feelings<br>
    about the situation. Troi can sense that this isn't<br>
    going anywhere. She tries to comfort Worf.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

    If you want to talk about this...<br>
    you know where to find me.</p>
  <p> Troi turns and EXITS. Worf is left to stare at the<br>
    broken table, Troi's words still hanging in the air...</p>
  <p>12 INT. ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data, Bashir and Geordi are examining the battered<br>
    cylinder seen earlier. Data indicates several input<br>
    ports on the cylinder.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    If we transfer twenty megajoules<br>
    of energy from the dilithium<br>

    should be enough to activate the<br>
    device.</p>
  <p> Geordi nods.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sounds like it's worth a try.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You two can start by connecting<br>
    the coil to the chamber. I'll<br>
    configure the energy transfer...</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    Right.</p>
  <p> Data and Bashir move to the warp core. They begin to<br>
    connect a fiber optic cable to the cylinder. As they<br>
    work...</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    Data... may I ask you a personal<br>
    question?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Certainly.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    Does your hair grow?</p>
  <p> Data thinks a moment, taken aback by the question.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I can control the rate of my<br>
    follicle replenishment. However,<br>
    I have not yet had a reason to<br>
    modify the length of my hair.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Why do you ask?</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    Just curious...</p>
  <p> Bashir finishes connecting the cable to the cylinder.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    Power conduits ready...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; -REV. 12/11/92 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Data connects the other end of the cable to the<br>
    dilithium chamber. Bashir opens a PANEL on the side of<br>
    the cylinder and starts to make adjustments to the<br>
    circuitry. Data kneels beside him to assist.</p>
  <p> They work for a moment... then Bashir glances at Data.<br>
    Something about his face catches his attention. He<br>
    moves closer, staring directly at his nose. Data takes<br>
    note.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Is there something wrong, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    You're breathing...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. I do have a functional<br>
    respiration system. However, its<br>
    purpose is to maintain the thermal<br>
    control of my internal systems.<br>
    I am, in fact, capable of<br>
    functioning for extended periods<br>
    in a vacuum.</p>
  <p> Bashir nods, fascinated. He reaches over and feels<br>
    Data's wrist.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    And you have a pulse...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My circulatory system not only<br>
    produces bio-chemical lubricants,<br>
    but regulates micro-hydraulic<br>
    power.</p>
  <p> Bashir looks impressed. They work for a moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (intrigued)<br>
    Most people are usually interested<br>
    in my extraordinary abilities.<br>
    How fast I can compute, my memory<br>
    capacity, how long I will live.<br>

  <p> BASHIR<br>
    Your creator went to a lot of<br>
    trouble to make you seem human...<br>
    I find that fascinating.</p>
  <p> Data considers. Geordi completes his work at the<br>
    console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We're ready to begin the transfer.</p>
  <p> Data completes the last connection on the cylinder.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The power connections are<br>
    complete.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    I'll monitor the coil's saturation<br>

    transient power response?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Of course.</p>

    Power levels are holding steady...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    Reduce the transfer rate...</p>
  <p> Geordi works the console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Reducing rate by... twenty<br>
    percent.</p>
  <p> Without warning, a TENDRIL of ENERGY arcs out from the<br>
    coil and directly onto Data's tricorder. Data's body<br>
    CRACKLES with BLUE LIGHT and he is JOLTED BACKWARD onto<br>
    the floor.</p>
  <p>13 CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE</p>
  <p> as he falls to the floor. Geordi and Bashir can be<br>
    heard talking, alarmed --</p>
  <p> BASHIR (V.O.)<br>
    Geordi -- shut it down!</p>
  <p> GEORDI (V.O.)<br>
    His net's been overloaded --</p>
  <p> Their voices grow distant... then fade away into total<br>
    silence. Data's eyes are closed.</p>
  <p> PULL BACK TO REVEAL:</p>
  <p>14 INT ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Data is now lying on the floor in the corridor. He<br>
    gets to his feet, glances around, startled at the<br>
    change in setting. He begins walking down the<br>
    corridor. The hall is empty and totally SILENT. There<br>
    is an eerie and surreal quality to the scene, as in a<br>
    dream. WE ARE EXPERIENCING DATA'S INTERNAL VISION.</p>
  <p> Data keeps walking, until a METALLIC BANGING SOUND is<br>
    heard echoing in the corridor, cutting through the<br>
    silence -- like metal on metal. Data stops, listens a<br>
    moment, then turns down a different corridor, following<br>
    the sound...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - 12/10/92 - ACT ONE 17.</p>
  <p>15 INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Data walking along. He sees something ahead of him...<br>
    slows down at the sight...</p>
  <p>16 A BLACKSMITH</p>
  <p> in full blacksmith attire, is sitting on a small bench<br>
    in the middle of the corridor, a few feet away from<br>
    Data. The man is pounding on a steel ANVIL with a<br>
    HAMMER. His head is turned down, his face obscured.</p>
  <p>17 DATA</p>
  <p> approaches the man... curious... He stops at the man,<br>
    stares down at him...</p>
  <p>18 THE BLACKSMITH</p>
  <p> looks up at Data -- it is DOCTOR NOONIAN SOONG. He is<br>
    a younger Soong than seen in &quot;Brothers&quot; -- a man in his<br>
    late forties, hair graying slightly.</p>
  <p>19 DATA</p>
  <p> reacts to the sight. Suddenly the scene...</p>

  <p> Data opens his eyes. He is still lying on the floor --<br>
    but a PANEL on the side of his head is now OPENED.<br>
    Geordi is working on the circuitry within. Bashir<br>
    stands nearby, watching anxiously. Data sits up and<br>
    glances around the room.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    Data, are you alright?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe so.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    A plasma shock overloaded your<br>

  <p>21 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> A few hours later. Data is running an internal self-diagnostic.<br>
    A PANEL on his head is OPEN. Geordi is<br>
    scanning Data's circuitry with a diagnostic INSTRUMENT.<br>
    Bashir looks on, concerned.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off instrument)<br>
    I can't find anything wrong with<br>
    your positronic sub-processors...<br>
    or with your controllers...</p>

    For the forty-seven seconds that<br>
    I was inactive, there is no record<br>
    of any cognitive activity.</p>

    There's no doubt about it, Data --<br>
    you were completely shut down.</p>

  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> A beat as they try to make sense out of the strange<br>
    situation.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe you had some kind of random<br>
    power fluctuation... and it<br>
    accessed one of your memory files.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is not possible. The image<br>
    I saw was of Doctor Soong as a<br>
    young man. I encountered him only<br>
    much later in his life.</p>
  <p> Data is perplexed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There does not appear to be a<br>
    rational explanation for my<br>
    experience.</p>
  <p> They consider. Finally, Geordi CLOSES the panel on<br>
    Data's head.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll take a look at the diagnostic<br>
    log again...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    In the meantime, we'd better<br>
    disconnect that medical device...</p>
  <p> Geordi moves to a console across the room. Bashir and<br>
    Data cross to the dilithium chamber and begin to<br>
    disconnect the cylinder from the core.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    (casually)<br>
    Maybe we're going about this the<br>
    wrong way...</p>

  <p>21 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What do you mean?</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    Maybe you had a dream... or a<br>
    hallucination...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am not capable of either of<br>
    those functions.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    But you can't account for what<br>
    happened today... can you?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    At present, I cannot.</p>
  <p> Bashir picks up the cylinder, turns to Data.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    Maybe you should approach this<br>
    from a more... human standpoint.<br>
    You're right that machines can't<br>
    have hallucinations...<br>

  <p>23 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Worf is sitting alone by the windows, a drink on the<br>

    clearly, he does not want to be bothered. He is lost<br>
    in thought, reflecting on the day's events...</p>
  <p>24 INCLUDE DATA</p>
  <p> as he ENTERS and scans the room -- sees Worf and heads<br>

    Wait.</p>
  <p> Data stops. Worf turns.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

    What is it, Commander?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am sorry to bother you. But I<br>
    have a question of a personal<br>
    nature. Do you have a moment?</p>
  <p> Worf is not in the mood for this, but...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A moment.</p>
  <p> Worf gestures to a chair and Data sits down.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have heard you mention that you<br>
    once experienced a vision.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes... when I was young... my<br>
    adoptive parents arranged for me<br>
    to partake in the Rite of MajQa.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I understand it involves deep<br>
    meditation inside the lava caves<br>
    of No'Mat. Prolonged exposure to<br>
    the heat induces a hallucinatory<br>
    effect.</p>
  <p> Worf thinks a moment... remembers his experience.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I spent six days in the lava<br>
    caves. For five days I saw<br>
    nothing. Then, on the sixth day,<br>
    as I was preparing to leave the<br>
    caves... Kahless came to me.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>

    When he appeared before me... he<br>
    told me that I would do what no<br>
    Klingon had ever done.</p>
  <p> Data considers.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You did become the first Klingon<br>
    in Starfleet.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes. It is as he said.</p>
  <p> A beat as Worf remembers the event -- clearly, it has<br>
    great meaning in his life. He looks at Data.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Why are you asking me about this?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have recently had an unexplained<br>
    experience, which might be<br>
    described as a &quot;vision&quot;.</p>
  <p> Worf leans forward, fascinated.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    An accident in Engineering shut<br>
    down my cognitive functions for a<br>
    short period of time. And yet, I<br>
    seemed to remain conscious.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I saw my father.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts -- the image strikes a chord in him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You are fortunate. That is a<br>
    powerful vision.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If it was a vision, I am not sure<br>
    how to proceed.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (it's obvious)<br>
    You must find its meaning.</p>
  <p> Data gives him a quizzical look.</p>

    If it has anything to do with your<br>
    father, you must learn all you can<br>
    about it.<br>

    In the Klingon MajQa ritual, there<br>
    is nothing more important than<br>
    receiving a revelation about your<br>

    talking to himself as well...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

    Your father is part of you...<br>
    always. Learning about him tells<br>
    you about yourself...<br>

  <p> Worf looks at him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, of course...</p>

    answer.</p>
  <p> Data thinks for a beat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

  <p>27 ANGLE - UPPER LEVEL</p>
  <p> where Shrek is standing, munching on a snack, his eyes<br>

  <p>29 INT. SHREK'S SHUTTLECRAFT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> (Redress of Enterprise shuttle.) Shrek and Worf at the<br>
    controls. Worf is dressed in DARK CAMOUFLAGE CLOTHING.<br>
    They are studying a console MONITOR that shows a<br>
    blurry, grainy GRAPHIC of a jungle and the surrounding<br>
    terrain -- like a reconnaissance photo.</p>
  <p> SHREK<br>
    (re: graphic)<br>
    The Romulan guards have a<br>
    detection perimeter. It will be<br>
    necessary to transport you to the<br>
    surface thirty kilometers from the<br>
    prison camp.</p>
  <p> Worf eyes the graphic.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The foliage is very dense. It<br>
    will take me approximately twelve<br>
    hours to reach the camp.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I will have to travel during the<br>
    night.</p>
  <p> SHREK<br>
    That would be unwise. This is not<br>
    an empty jungle. There are many<br>
    predators.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (confident)<br>
    I am prepared.</p>
  <p> SHREK<br>
    Very well. But I would recommend<br>
    that you look up from time to<br>
    time. The arboreal needle snake<br>
    likes to attack from above.</p>
  <p> Worf shoots a him a look. Shrek works the console.</p>
  <p> SHREK<br>
    I will provide you with a map of<br>
    the camp...</p>

  <p> Worf watches Shrek for a moment, curious.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    How did you learn of this camp?</p>
  <p> SHREK<br>
    That is not important for you to<br>
    know.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Why have you not informed the<br>
    Klingon government of this place?</p>
  <p> SHREK<br>
    I sell information... I do not<br>
    give it away.</p>
  <p> Worf grows angry.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (accusing)<br>
    You withhold this information...<br>
    for profit.</p>
  <p> Shrek bristles at the accusation -- he fixes Worf with<br>
    a cold look.</p>
  <p> SHREK<br>
    I have my reasons, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What reason could you have for<br>
    letting these people suffer?</p>
  <p> A tense beat. Shrek opts not to answer, turns back to<br>
    the console.</p>

    We will arrive in the Carraya<br>
    Sector in approximately three<br>
    hours. I suggest you get some<br>
    rest.</p>
  <p> Worf eyes him a beat, then stands and moves to work at<br>
    the rear of the shuttle.</p>
  <p>30 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> docked at DS9.</p>
  <p>31 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard is at his desk, studying a computer terminal.<br>
    The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Data ENTERS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am sorry to disturb you, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - 12/10/92 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not at all. I'm just studying the<br>
    intricacies of Bajoran aqueduct<br>
    management...<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    I could use an interruption about<br>
    now. Please, sit down.</p>
  <p> Data sits.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I require your advice. I have<br>
    come to an impasse regarding my<br>
    recent unexplained experience.</p>
  <p> Picard leans forward, intrigued -- he's heard about the<br>
    incident.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh yes... of course... your<br>
    &quot;vision&quot; of Doctor Soong. How's<br>
    your investigation coming along?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have analyzed over four thousand<br>
    different religious and<br>
    philosophical systems, as well as<br>
    over two hundred psychological<br>
    schools of thought in an effort to<br>
    understand what happened.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What have you found?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have been unable to find a<br>
    single interpretation of the<br>
    images I saw during the time I was<br>
    shut down.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The image of a hammer, for<br>
    instance, could have many<br>
    different meanings. Klingon<br>
    culture views the hammer as a<br>
    symbol of power. However, the<br>
    Taqua tribe of Nagor views it as<br>
    an icon of hearth and home. The<br>
    Feregni see it as a sign of sexual<br>
    prowess.</p>
  <p> Picard considers.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; -REV. 12/10/92 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm curious. Why are you looking<br>
    at all these other cultures?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The interpretation of visions and<br>
    other metaphysical experiences are<br>
    almost always culturally derived.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And I have no culture of my own.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes you do. You are a culture of<br>
    one. And that's no less valid<br>
    than a culture of one billion.</p>
  <p> Picard stands, begins to walk around the room,<br>
    compelled by Data's mystery.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Perhaps the key to understanding<br>
    your experience is to stop looking<br>
    into other sources for meaning...<br>
    (explains)<br>
    You wouldn't look at<br>
    Michaelangelo's David... or<br>
    Symnay's Tomb... and ask &quot;what<br>
    does this mean to other people?&quot;<br>
    The real question is, &quot;what does<br>
    it mean to you?&quot;</p>
  <p> Data considers this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (with emphasis)<br>
    Explore the image, Data. Let it<br>
    capture your imagination. Focus<br>
    on it... spend some time with<br>
    it... and see where it takes you.<br>
    Let it inspire you.</p>
  <p> Data nods. He stands, driven by Picard's words.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe I understand, sir.<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good luck, Data.</p>
  <p> Data EXITS. Picard smiles after him for a moment...<br>
    then his face falls as he turns to the comparatively<br>
    mundane matters on his terminal...</p>

  <p>32 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Decorated as usual; including a large POTTED PLANT<br>
    visible in the corner. Data ENTERS and walks to his<br>
    desk. He sits down and begins to contemplate the day's<br>
    events. His CAT, Spot, hops up onto his lap. Data<br>
    pets him a moment, absorbed in thought...</p>
  <p> He gets an idea. He glances across the room, toward a<br>
    CANVAS which sits on an easel. He eyes it a moment,<br>
    then stands and crosses to it. He picks up a paint<br>
    brush. A long moment goes by as he considers the blank<br>
    canvas... letting his thoughts form and take shape...<br>
    then he dips the brush into a palette of oils and<br>
    begins to PAINT...</p>
  <p> After a beat, he stops to eye what he's done so far...<br>
    satisfied, he continues to paint... faster... and<br>
    faster...</p>
  <p> MOVE TO REVEAL: THE PAINTING. It's the beginnings of<br>
    a blacksmith at an anvil. As Data paints, faster, now<br>
    at android speed...</p>
  <p>33 EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT</p>
  <p> A small, moonlit clearing in a dense tropical FOREST.<br>
    From out of the foliage, Worf and Shrek appear. Worf<br>
    is in his dark clothing, a BACKPACK strapped to his<br>
    back. Shrek looks nervous. He takes a step forward,<br>
    eyeing the area... then points the way...</p>
  <p> SHREK<br>
    The camp is in a Southeasterly<br>
    direction. After approximately<br>
    ten kilometers, you will reach the<br>
    edge of the sulfur canyons. Look<br>
    for a riverbank -- follow it<br>
    until you reach the camp.</p>
  <p> Worf nods -- peers into the dark forest. He's anxious<br>
    to get going. Shrek hands Worf a small DEVICE.</p>
  <p> SHREK<br>
    (re: device)<br>
    This is a homing device. It will<br>
    allow you to find my ship when I<br>
    return. I will not be landing in<br>
    the same location.</p>

    When will you be back?</p>
  <p> SHREK<br>
    Fifty hours.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Do not be late.</p>
  <p> Shrek turns and walks away. Worf watches as he<br>
    disappears into the trees. Then he turns and peers<br>
    into the direction of the prison camp. A long beat as<br>
    he considers the dense and mysterious jungle. He takes<br>
    a few steps forward...</p>
  <p> From somewhere in the distance, the SCREECH of a wild<br>
    animal is heard. Worf hesitates, listening... silence<br>
    again, except for the gentle rustling of the trees.</p>
  <p> Worf nervously looks above him... just checking for<br>
    needle snakes... then tightens the backpack, steels<br>
    himself, then begins to walk through the forest.</p>
  <p> As he disappears into the murky jungle...</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>34 EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Worf is moving through the trees, covered with mud and<br>
    brush -- he's been travelling for many hours, and it's<br>
    beginning to show. He stops at a tree, leans against<br>
    it to take a rest... takes off his backpack and pulls<br>
    out a CONTAINER of water. He takes a long, thirsty<br>
    drink. A quiet moment as he catches his breath...</p>
  <p> Somewhere in the distance, the SOUND of splashing water<br>
    can be heard. Worf freezes at the sound, listens...<br>
    then quietly puts on his backpack and makes his way<br>
    through the jungle toward the noise...</p>
  <p>35 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> of Worf moving through the jungle, following the<br>
    splashing sound. The noise grows louder as he gets<br>
    closer... closer... until he stops and parts the<br>
    trees... peers out and reacts to something he sees...</p>
  <p>36 WORF'S POV</p>
  <p> of a POND in the jungle. Splashing around in the water<br>
    is a young and beautiful KLINGON WOMAN -- BA'EL. She<br>
    is nude, and oblivious to Worf's presence, enjoying her<br>
    bath...</p>
  <p>37 WORF</p>
  <p> steps back slightly and watches in silence... curious<br>
    about the woman... surprised at the sight of her...</p>
  <p>38 BA'EL</p>
  <p> rinses herself a few more times, luxuriating in the<br>
    water. Then she begins to make her way toward the<br>
    shore. As she emerges from the water...</p>
  <p>39 WORF</p>
  <p> moves back into the jungle so he cannot be seen. Ba'el<br>
    can be glimpsed in the background, partially obscured<br>
    by trees, as she comes out of the water and slips into<br>
    a loose-fitting robe...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - REV. 12/10/92 - ACT FOUR 36.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf accidentally brushes against a branch -- it makes<br>
    a slight CRACKING sound.</p>
  <p>40 BA'EL</p>
  <p> stops at the noise -- glances around, startled.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Who's there?</p>
  <p> Worf remains motionless, silent. Ba'el pulls the robe<br>
    against her body, covering herself. She takes a step<br>
    toward the trees...</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Toq... is that you?</p>
  <p> No answer. She peers hard into the dark forest -- and<br>
    can make out a shape behind the trees. She reacts,<br>
    annoyed.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    I can see you...<br>
    (wry)<br>
    I hope you're enjoying yourself.</p>
  <p> She takes a step toward the trees.</p>
  <p>41 WORF</p>
  <p> isn't sure what to do. He watches as the Klingon woman<br>
    makes her way toward him... closer...</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Toq, I swear I will hang you by<br>
    your...</p>
  <p> She pulls aside the branches and sees Worf. She gasps,<br>
    stumbling backward, alarmed at the sight of him.</p>
  <p> Worf goes after her, tries to calm her down.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Stop, please...</p>
  <p> She stops at the edge of the pond, shaken.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Who are you?</p>

    Help me... ?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    How did you get out of the camp?<br>
    Does anyone know you are gone?</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Yes... I come here often...</p>
  <p> Worf moves to her, urgent.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You must lead me to the camp.</p>
  <p> She studies his face, amazed.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    You are Klingon... Where have you<br>
    come from?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That does not matter. I am here<br>
    to take you home.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    (confused)<br>
    Home... this is my home...</p>
  <p> Before Worf can respond, a NOISE is heard from<br>
    offscreen. Someone is approaching. Worf reacts,<br>
    startled.</p>

    It is important that you tell no<br>

    says. But she nods anyway, intrigued with him.</p>
  <p> Worf quickly hides amongst the trees.</p>
  <p>42 A ROMULAN GUARD</p>
  <p> appears from within the jungle and walks up to Ba'el.<br>
    The Romulan says something to her, but his words are<br>
    not clear. Ba'el nods, grim-faced, and the two of them<br>
    continue walking through the trees.</p>

  <p> There are at least TEN PAINTINGS of various shapes and<br>
    sizes spread around the room, many on easels, others<br>
    hanging where there is available space. Geordi<br>
    ventures into the cramped area and gazes at the various<br>
    paintings. Some of the paintings are complete; others<br>
    are works in progress. All of the images are<br>
    variations on a single theme: images derived from<br>
    Data's &quot;vision.&quot;</p>
  <p> Many paintings show various angles of a blacksmith, his<br>
    face obscured, working at an anvil. Others portray a<br>
    bird's wing -- full views and details of feathers. One<br>
    shows a blue sky, with a flock of birds visible flying<br>
    in formation. The image of smoke is prevalent, as well<br>
    as other details from the vision: The bucket. An<br>
    Enterprise corridor. An anvil. A hammer. A hand. A<br>
    piece of glowing hot metal.</p>
  <p>47 INCLUDE DATA</p>
  <p> who is standing between two canvases, a brush in each<br>
    hand, working on two paintings at once. One painting<br>
    shows a plume of smoke rising out of the bucket; the<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    And I will prepare the power<br>
    transfer.</p>
  <p> Geordi nods and EXITS. Data turns to a painting of a<br>
    bird. As he stares at it, his face unreadable...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; -REV. 12/11/92 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>48 INT. ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A few hours later. Bashir is present, and is setting<br>
    up the plasma coil cylinder seen earlier. He is<br>
    connecting the optical cable from the cylinder to the<br>
    dilithium chamber.</p>
  <p> Everything is similar to the experiment in Act Two, but<br>
    now Data is sitting on a chair near the chamber. A<br>
    PANEL on his head is OPEN, and an optical cable leads<br>
    from his head to a console. Geordi is making a final<br>
    adjustment to his circuitry.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Data, re: cables)<br>
    We're going to monitor every subsystem<br>
    in your positronic net. If<br>
    I see any neural pathways overload<br>
    beyond sixty-five percent... I'm<br>
    shutting down the experiment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Agreed.</p>
  <p> Bashir finishes connecting the cable from the cylinder<br>
    to the dilithium chamber.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    We're ready.</p>
  <p> Geordi takes a breath, then moves to a console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Initiating energy transfer...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; -REV. 12/11/92 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>48 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The sequence of events are exactly as they were before;<br>
    but now the attitudes are markedly different: everybody<br>
    knows what is about to happen. Geordi and Bashir take<br>
    a few steps away from Data, keeping a safe distance.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Get ready, Data...</p>
  <p> Data picks up a tricorder and makes a few adjustments.<br>
    He then points it at the cylinder, as he did the last<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> We HEAR a HUMMING NOISE from the warp core -- then the<br>
    cylinder's lights begin to blink rapidly.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    (off cylinder panel)<br>
    Power levels are rising...</p>
  <p> The humming noise INTENSIFIES. Data braces himself.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Should be any second now...</p>
  <p> And it happens: A TENDRIL of ENERGY arcs out from the<br>
    coil and directly onto Data's tricorder. Data's body<br>
    CRACKLES with BLUE LIGHT and he is JOLTED BACKWARD --</p>
  <p>49 CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE</p>
  <p> as he falls back into the chair. Geordi and Bashir can<br>
    be heard talking, but their voices grow distant... then<br>
    fade away into total silence. Data's eyes are closed.</p>
  <p> PULL BACK TO REVEAL:</p>
  <p>50 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> He begins walking down the hall. It is empty and<br>
    silent. There is an eerie and surreal quality to the<br>
    scene, as in a dream.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - REV. 12/10/92 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> We are experiencing Data's internal vision, as seen in<br>
    Act One.</p>
  <p> Data keeps walking, until a METALLIC BANGING SOUND is<br>
    heard echoing in the corridor, cutting through the<br>
    silence. Data stops, listens a moment, then turns down<br>
    a different corridor, following the sound...</p>
  <p>51 INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Data walking along. He sees something ahead of him...<br>
    slows down at the sight...</p>
  <p>52 A BLACKSMITH</p>
  <p> in full blacksmith attire, is sitting on a small bench<br>
    in the middle of the corridor, a few feet away from<br>
    Data. The man is pounding on a steel ANVIL with a<br>
    HAMMER. His head is turned down, his face is obscured.</p>
  <p>53 DATA</p>
  <p> approaches the man... curious... he knows this is the<br>
    blacksmith from his original &quot;vision.&quot; He stops at the<br>
    man, stares down at him...</p>
  <p>54 THE BLACKSMITH</p>
  <p> looks up at Data -- it is Doctor Noonian Soong.</p>
  <p>55 DATA</p>
  <p> reacts to the sight. He looks down at the anvil...</p>
  <p>56 ANGLE ON THE ANVIL</p>
  <p> as the hammer moves away to reveal what is not a piece<br>
    of metal -- but a delicate BIRD'S WING.</p>
  <p>57 THE BLACKSMITH/DOCTOR SOONG</p>
  <p> stares at Data a moment, then picks up the bird's wing<br>
    with a pair of metal tongs... and dunks the wing into<br>
    a BUCKET. SMOKE bursts up out of the bucket.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - REV. 12/10/92 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>57 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data steps back from the smoke. Then the smoke clears<br>
    away to reveal:</p>
  <p> Soong is gone. The bucket is also missing -- in its<br>
    place is a live BIRD. Data stares at the bird,<br>
    confused.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the bird FLIES away -- and off down the<br>
    corridor. Data watches it go...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    That bird did not appear in my<br>
    original experience. This vision<br>
    is different.</p>
  <p> From offscreen:</p>
  <p> SOONG (O.S.)<br>
    Of course it's different.</p>
  <p> Data turns toward the voice. In the blink of an eye,<br>
    everything changes:</p>
  <p>58 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data is now standing on the Bridge. It is empty,<br>
    except for the potted plant from his room, and a few of<br>
    his recent paintings, which hang on various walls of<br>
    the Bridge. His cat, Spot, is sleeping in the<br>
    Captain's chair.</p>
  <p> Doctor Soong is standing in front of Data. There is a<br>
    whimsical quality to Soong.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It's never the same. Always<br>
    changing. Unpredictable. It<br>
    doesn't make sense...</p>
  <p> Soong begins to move about the room -- and the SOUND of<br>
    a FLOCK OF BIRDS is heard rushing overhead. Data looks<br>
    up, but sees nothing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Soong)<br>
    Father, what is happening?</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    I don't know, Data. What is<br>
    happening?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - REV. 12/10/92 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>58 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data glances around.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We are on the Bridge of the<br>
    Enterprise. My cat is present,<br>
    and my potted plant, and my<br>
    paintings.</p>
  <p> Soong looks pleased.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    A wonderful beginning. Still a<br>
    little grounded in the mundane,<br>
    but showing promise...</p>
  <p> Data looks puzzled.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not understand.</p>
  <p> Soong moves toward Data. The SOUND of the blacksmith's<br>
    hammer POUNDING on metal can be heard with each step<br>
    that he takes. Surreal.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    You're not supposed to. No man<br>
    should know where his dreams come<br>
    from. It spoils the mystery...<br>
    the fun.</p>
  <p> Soong reaches out a hand and touches Data's face.... he<br>
    smiles.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm proud of you, son. I wasn't<br>
    sure you'd ever develop the<br>
    cognitive abilities to make it<br>
    this far...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But if you're here... if you can<br>
    see me... it means you've crossed<br>
    the threshold from being a<br>
    collection of circuits and<br>
    subprocessors... and have started<br>
    a wonderful journey.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What type of journey?</p>
  <p> In the blink of an eye, it all changes:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; -REV. 12/11/92 - ACT FOUR 48.</p>
  <p>59 NEW ANGLE - A BED</p>
  <p> is now on the Bridge. Data is lying on the bed,<br>
    startled by the change in setting. Soong is standing<br>
    beside the bed. The sound of birds SINGING can be<br>
    heard.</p>
  <p> Data looks around, startled by the change in setting.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Think of it as an empty sky.</p>
  <p> Soong begins to pull up the bed covers, as if tucking<br>
    in a small child. Data considers his words.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not understand.</p>
  <p> Soong gently closes Data's eyes.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (gently)<br>
    Shhh.... just dream, Data...<br>
    dream...</p>
  <p> Soong leans in close to Data and whispers into his ear.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    You are the bird.</p>
  <p> MOVE CLOSE ONTO DATA'S FACE -- as he opens his eyes,<br>
    suddenly understanding what it all means...</p>
  <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
  <p>60 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> We are MOVING down the corridor in a floating POV -- as<br>
    though through the eyes of a bird. Faster down the<br>
    empty corridor... then we turn down another corridor<br>
    and see Soong the blacksmith working at the anvil...<br>
    and we SWOOP UPWARD into the light on the ceiling as<br>
    the scene...</p>
  <p> DISSOLVES TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - REV. 12/10/92 - ACT FOUR 49.</p>
  <p>61 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A bird's eye view, MOVING past the Enterprise... and<br>
    away from it... out into space... the stars whipping<br>
    past... exciting... vast...</p>
  <p> The SOUND of a flock of BIRDS can be heard as we soar<br>
    off into space...</p>
  <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
  <p>62 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE as he begins to regain<br>
    consciousness. Geordi and Bashir are standing nearby.</p>
  <p> As Data reacts to his extraordinary experience...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; -REV. 12/11/92 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>63 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Data and Bashir walking along, mid-conversation. Data<br>
    is clearly back to normal again -- conscious and safe.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The images I saw during the time<br>
    I was shut down were generated by<br>
    a series of previously dormant<br>
    circuits in my neural net.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I believe Doctor Soong<br>
    incorporated those circuits into<br>
    my base programming, intending<br>
    them to be activated when I<br>
    reached a certain level of<br>
    development.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    (onto the idea)<br>
    But the plasma shock activated<br>
    them prematurely...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct.</p>
  <p> They walk for a beat.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    I'm curious... now that those<br>
    circuits are active... what do you<br>
    intend to do with them?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I plan to shut down my cognitive<br>
    functions for a brief period of<br>
    time each day.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I hope to generate new internal<br>
    visions.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    It sounds like you're talking<br>
    about dreaming...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    An accurate analogy.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; -REV. 12/11/92 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Bashir finds this fascinating.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    Remarkable... This is just the<br>
    kind of thing that could get me<br>
    published in the Starfleet<br>
    Cybernetics Journal...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Would you mind if I authored a<br>
    paper about all this?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Of course not.</p>
  <p> They reach a Turbolift. Bashir turns to him and<br>
    smiles.</p>
  <p> BASHIR<br>
    Thank you, Data.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And... sweet dreams.</p>
  <p> Bashir enters the Turbolift and the doors slide shut.<br>
    OFF Data's face as he considers his words...</p>
  <p>64 EXT. PRISON COMPOUND - NIGHT - ANGLE - A CONCRETE<br>
    WALL</p>
  <p> as seen from inside the compound. It's a tall security<br>
    wall that surrounds the perimeter of the prison camp.<br>
    A HAND clamps down from the outside of the wall and<br>
    grabs hold of the edge... then a second hand appears.<br>
    A moment later, Worf's head becomes visible as he<br>
    hoists himself up and peers into the camp...</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>65 WORF'S POV</p>
  <p> of the large, dimly lit compound. A couple of small<br>
    BARRACKS are visible... a MEETING HALL... and a small<br>
    GARDEN area. The architecture is 24th Century, but<br>
    it's clearly a little rough around the edges.</p>
  <p> TWO KLINGONS -- middle-aged, dressed in simple tunics --<br>
    round a corner and walk across the camp. Worf watches<br>
    them carefully, trying to ascertain the situation. The<br>
    two Klingons round another corner and disappear into<br>
    the center of the camp, which cannot be seen...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - 12/10/92 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>65 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf pulls himself up onto the wall, tries to get a<br>
    better view of the camp. FIRELIGHT can be seen<br>
    flickering on a barrack wall... and faint VOICES can be<br>
    heard. It is clear that people are gathering somewhere<br>
    nearby.</p>
  <p> The faint strains of a haunting Klingon ARIA can also<br>
    be heard. Although the voice is weathered and a little<br>
    past its prime, it carries great feeling, and Worf is<br>
    momentarily caught up by it...</p>
  <p>66 TWO ROMULAN GUARDS</p>
  <p> suddenly round a corner. Worf immediately drops his<br>
    head below the wall's edge to avoid being seen. He<br>
    waits a tense moment before pulling himself up again.<br>
    He glances around to make sure the coast is clear, then<br>
    he pulls himself over the wall and DROPS to the ground<br>
    inside the camp...</p>
  <p>67 NEW ANGLE - WORF</p>
  <p> inside the compound. He stays close to the wall a<br>
    moment, silent and alert. Then he quickly runs to the<br>
    shadows afforded by a barrack wall, and flattens<br>
    himself against it. He looks around the corner toward<br>
    the center of the compound...</p>
  <p>68 WORF'S POV - ON THE CENTRAL SQUARE</p>
  <p> A half-dozen KLINGONS -- young and old -- dressed in<br>
    the tunics are gathered around a large CAMP FIRE,<br>
    listening to the gentle aria being sung by an elderly<br>
    looking Klingon -- L'KOR.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    (sings)<br>
    &quot;van'aj javDIch Qong DIr Sa'VIch<br>

    &quot;teblaw'nghu mughato'Du ylja'Qo'<br>
    ylja'Qo' ylja'Qo'... &quot;</p>
  <p> L'Kor trails off, ending the lullaby. The crackle of<br>
    the fire a moment. Then L'Kor stands to go. He parts<br>
    the crowd as he leaves the central square and makes his<br>
    way across the camp. Worf watches him as he enters the<br>
    meeting hall...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - 12/10/92 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>69 INT. MEETING HALL</p>
  <p> A large, sparsely appointed room. Various rectangular<br>
    tables are located here and there, with accompanying<br>
    chairs. The room is dimly-lit.</p>
  <p> L'Kor walks across the room, past a shadowy corner...</p>
  <p> Without warning, Worf jumps out from behind the<br>
    darkness and GRABS L'Kor, clamping a hand over his<br>
    mouth.</p>
  <p> L'Kor yells out in surprise, but his voice is muffled.</p>
  <p> Worf drags the struggling Klingon back into the<br>
    shadows, where they cannot be seen. L'Kor continues to<br>
    thrash about, tries to call out.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (harsh whisper)<br>
    Quiet! I am a friend.</p>
  <p> A beat goes by... then L'Kor stops struggling. Worf<br>
    removes his hand from L'Kor's mouth. L'Kor stares at<br>
    him, stunned by the sight.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    Who... who are you?</p>
  <p> Worf releases his grip on L'Kor, who turns to face him.<br>
    They stare at one another... tense...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am Worf... son of Mogh.</p>
  <p> L'Kor's eyes widen.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    Why have you come here?</p>
  <p> Worf takes an anxious step toward him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have come to find my father. Is<br>
    he alive? Is he here?</p>
  <p> L'Kor's expression darkens...</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    Your father... fell at Khitomer.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts to the news -- turns away. It's a shock.<br>
    Deep down, he wanted to believe his father was alive...<br>
    made the journey to find him... and now --<br>
    disappointment. After a beat, he recovers...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; -REV. 12/11/92 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>69 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Did he... die in battle?</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    (nods)<br>
    He was fortunate.</p>
  <p> Worf eyes him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You were captured...</p>
  <p> L'Kor nods, uncomfortable speaking of the matter.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    During the battle, many Klingons<br>
    were taken prisoner. We fought<br>
    our captors... but we failed...</p>
  <p> Worf is angered by what has been done to them.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The Romulans robbed you of your<br>
    right to die with honor.</p>
  <p> As if the memory were too much to bear, L'Kor nods<br>
    grimly. Worf takes action -- speaks quickly, urgent.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There is little time. How many<br>
    Klingons are being held here?</p>
  <p> L'Kor hesitates.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    Seventy-three...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    How many Romulans guard the camp?</p>
  <p> L'Kor isn't sure how to respond -- he tries to stall.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    Worf... there are... things you do<br>
    not understand...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What do you mean?</p>

  <p>69 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    (halting)<br>
    I must... speak with the Elders.</p>
  <p> L'Kor moves to the door and opens it... peers outside.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    (summons)<br>
    ghoS! (Come!)</p>
  <p> He turns back to Worf... moves to him... eyeing his<br>
    face... remembering...</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    I knew your father well, Worf...</p>
  <p> L'Kor allows himself to become lost in the memory...</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And I remember you... a boy...<br>
    barely able to lift a Bat'telth...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Once... your father insisted we<br>
    take you on the ritual hunt. You<br>
    were so eager, you tried to take<br>
    the beast with your bare hands...<br>
    it mauled your arm...</p>
  <p> Worf instinctively touches his arm, remembering...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes... I still have the scar...</p>
  <p> Worf studies L'Kor's face...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I remember you now...</p>
  <p> A moment between them. Then L'Kor turns away, his face<br>
    graven.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    You should not have come here,<br>
    Worf.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I do not understand.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; -REV. 12/11/92 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>69 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    (with sadness)<br>
    You should not have come.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, THREE OLDER KLINGONS -- two Elders and<br>
    GI'RAL, a female -- ENTER. They stop at the sight of<br>
    Worf, stunned by his presence.</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    (re: Worf)<br>
    Who is this?</p>
  <p> Worf steps forward.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am Worf... son of Mogh. I have<br>
    come to help you escape.</p>
  <p> The Elders exchange an uncertain glance.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    (to others)<br>
    He does not know.</p>
  <p> Gi'ral is alarmed at the situation.</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    He must leave at once...</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    No. It is too late for that. He<br>
    would bring others...</p>
  <p> L'Kor gestures to Worf.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    (a command)<br>
    vang ghaH! (Take him!)</p>
  <p> Without hesitation, the two Elders move toward Worf in<br>
    a threatening manner. Worf reacts, makes a quick move<br>
    toward the side door to get away -- but is grabbed by<br>
    L'Kor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright&quot; - 12/10/92 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>69 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> A quick struggle -- until two of the Elders also seize<br>
    Worf... and they drag him to a chair and pin him<br>
    down...</p>
  <p> Worf can hardly believe his eyes. Here are his fellow<br>
    Klingons, who he thought to be prisoners -- but their<br>
    actions are utterly inexplicable. It's a chilling<br>
    predicament, and Worf never stops resisting.</p>
  <p> L'Kor looks down at Worf, his expression hard --<br>
    threatening.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    We are not leaving here. And<br>
    neither are you.</p>
  <p> OFF Worf's astonishment...</p>
