    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> traveling at high warp against an array of stars.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 41242.4.<br>
    Our last assignment has taken us<br>
    into the remote Omicron Theta<br>
    star system, home of our android<br>
    crewmember Lieutenant Commander<br>
    Data. Although we are due...</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Everyone at his regular station with the exception of<br>
    Data whose station is manned by WESLEY.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... at our next assignment, I have<br>
    decided to increase velocity to<br>
    warp eight to visit Data's home<br>
    planet for a few hours in the<br>
    hopes of unraveling some of the<br>
    mystery of his beginnings.</p>
  <p> GEORDI turns to RIKER.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sir, we are now twenty minutes<br>
    from Omicron Theta...<br>
    (checks reading)<br>
    ... mark!</p>
  <p> Riker gets a nod from PICARD, replies to Geordi.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Stand by for subwarp; head for<br>
    standard orbit of Data's planet.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Wonder why Data hasn't come up<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - 10/26/87 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He said he wanted to be alone.<br>
    Perhaps it's a bigger moment for<br>
    him than we thought.<br>
    (turns to Wesley)<br>
    If he needs a formal invitation,<br>
    Ensign, you do the honors.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (to his feet)<br>
    Yes sir!</p>
  <p> Wesley heads quickly toward the turbolift.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Walk!</p>
  <p> Wesley slows to a walk.</p>
  <p>3 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Totally bare except for a quite sophisticated wall<br>
    computer and a mirror on a tripod which DATA now stands<br>
    in front of watching himself. He SNEEZES. It is not<br>
    a good sneeze, comes off rather artificial. Data tries<br>
    again, harder... but not much better. Then a CHIME<br>
    and Wesley ENTERS.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (excitedly)<br>
    Data... !</p>
  <p> Data SNEEZES a third time. Wesley stops, puzzled.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What are you doing?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sneezing.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Have you got a... a &quot;cold?&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A cold what?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's a disease my mother says<br>
    people used to get.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - 10/26/87 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Ah. But humans still sneeze for<br>
    other reasons and I cannot seem<br>
    to do it right.</p>
  <p> Another artificial sounding SNEEZE.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    How can you be practicing sneezing<br>
    when you're arriving for the first<br>
    time at your home planet? Aren't<br>
    you interested in that?</p>
  <p> Without changing tone of voice or expression, Data<br>
    heads with Wesley for the door of the cabin.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    More than interested. Fascinated.<br>
    One might say agog. But I find<br>
    sneezing interesting also.</p>
  <p>4 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> From the Main Viewer WE CAN SEE that the starship is<br>
    at subwarp now, and a rather BROWNISH LOOKING PLANET<br>
    IS COMING INTO VIEW in the distance.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (checking readings)<br>
    Confirming Class M reading there.<br>
    But...<br>
    (checks readings)<br>
    ... but the sensors aren't showing<br>
    any life readings. Not even<br>
    vegetation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Strange. The cruiser that found<br>
    Data reported farmland here.</p>
  <p> Data and Wesley EMERGE from the turbolift, CROSS ONTO<br>
    the bridge. Riker turns to Data, indicates Helm.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Want to take her into orbit, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/27/87 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker, surprised, indicates for Wesley to fill Data's<br>
    Helm position again. Data instead, walks forward and<br>
    examines the PLANET COMING CLOSER, more than filling<br>
    the Main Viewer screen. All eyes are on Data as he<br>
    examines his home planet on the viewer, then turns and<br>
    moves back to take a seat in the Command Area.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Continue on into close parking<br>
    orbit.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (beat; to Picard)<br>
    I could say &quot;home, sweet home,&quot;<br>
    sir... if I understood how the<br>
    word sweet applies.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It usually refers to the memories.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But usually one's own memories,<br>
    Captain.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Do the memories you were given<br>
    include &quot;farms?&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Affirmative, sir. Turning soil,<br>
    seeding, harvesting... but the<br>
    colony's principal interest was<br>
    science.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Data, I can't understand how you<br>
    can hold the memories of four<br>
    hundred eleven people. If that<br>
    means every experience, every day<br>
    they lived...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It does not, unfortunately. It<br>
    means only the knowledge they had<br>
    accumulated. Actually, I am quite<br>
    deficient in some basic human<br>
    information.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Sneezing, for example.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/27/87 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    &quot;Sneezing?&quot;</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Approaching close parking orbit,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Assemble your away party,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> Riker stands; Picard smiles at Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This is an exciting moment for<br>
    you, Data. I'm tempted to lead<br>
    the away team down myself, except<br>
    for the fact the first officer<br>
    would object...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How would Starfleet judge me if<br>
    I didn't, sir? An entire Earth<br>
    colony did disappear down there.</p>
  <p> As Riker stands, replacements are ENTERING to take over<br>
    the bridge positions of Geordi, Worf and Tasha who will<br>
    move to the turbolift with him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    You have no memory at all of what<br>
    happened to them, Data?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - 10/26/87 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My final memory is of great<br>
    danger, something sudden and not<br>
    understood... then a blank as if<br>
    the colonists were gone.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Now in close parking orbit, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Welcome home, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> Data looks puzzled at this. Then he joins the away<br>
    team which EXITS the bridge.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT:</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The starship in close orbit of Data's home planet.</p>
  <p>6 EXT. DATA'S PLANET (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Away Team of Riker, Data, GEORDI, TASHA and WORF<br>
    MATERIALIZING on the planet surface. Far from it<br>
    looking like farmland, the place is barren. They<br>
    stand for a moment looking around -- Worf is alert to<br>
    any security problems -- Tasha scans with her tricorder<br>
    -- Riker is carefully looking over their surroundings<br>
    -- Geordi kneels, inspecting the ground.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Recording signal now locked onto<br>
    the Enterprise, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    This looks like anything but<br>
    farmland.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Agreed, sir. The soil here's<br>
    completely lifeless.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is the exact position listed<br>
    in the Tripoli log.<br>
    (turning<br>
    Do you recognize anything, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The land contours are familiar,<br>
    sir. Topographically, this is<br>
    the correct area.</p>
  <p> Interrupted by Geordi who has begun crumbling soil<br>
    close to his nose, examining it as he lets the<br>
    fragments fall from his hand.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    This once was rich farmland. I'd<br>
    guess something like twenty to<br>
    thirty years ago...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I was discovered twenty-six years<br>
    ago...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (still sifting soil)<br>
    There is still plant cellulose<br>
    in the soil. No signs of decay.<br>
    Also no signs of bacteria either.<br>
    (looks up)<br>
    If you don't mind a wild guess,<br>
    sir, I'd say everything on this<br>
    planet could have been dead or<br>
    dying at the time Data was found.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Tripoli log stated that all<br>
    plant life appeared brown and<br>
    &quot;dormant.&quot; They assumed it was<br>
    normal for that season.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    ... whereas actually everything<br>
    was dying...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (interrupting;<br>
    indicating)<br>
    I was found twenty meters in that<br>
    direction, sir.</p>
  <p> Data begins leading the way toward a narrow ledge<br>
    leading down into a depression.</p>
  <p>7 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as all follow Data's lead.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (moving alongside Data)<br>
    Data, any idea at all why you were<br>
    given the colonists' memories?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have always felt that it was<br>
    done hurriedly, but I know little<br>
    more.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - 10/26/87 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data stops where a small rectangular depression has<br>
    been carved in the rock.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Here, sir. This is where the<br>
    cruiser's landing party found<br>
    the signal device that had led<br>
    them here.<br>
    (indicates)<br>
    And they found me lying there,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p>8 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Data is leading them to a very undistinguished-looking<br>
    stone pallet. This and the barren location look to<br>
    be considerably less than the exciting mystery they<br>
    have expected.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    You were just lying out in the<br>
    open? No identity record, no<br>
    instructions... ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Only a layer of dust.</p>
  <p> Data bends, BLOWS, and a CLOUD OF DUST ARISES from the<br>
    pallet.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There's much more of it now, after<br>
    twenty-six years.</p>
  <p> Only Geordi shows active interest in this place. He<br>
    has moved off to begin scanning the area from different<br>
    perspectives.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What is the first thing you<br>
    remember, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Opening my eyes and finding myself<br>
    looking into the eyes of the<br>
    Tripoli landing party, sir.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA (Cont'd)<br>
    (indicating the path<br>
    back)<br>
    They believed that the signal<br>
    device sensed their presence,<br>
    and activated me.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Then this very spot was your<br>
    birthplace...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But not at all like a human birth.<br>
    Having the colonists' memories,<br>
    I knew immediately how to speak,<br>
    who I was, where I was...</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    You were born and became fully<br>
    knowledgeable at the same instant!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I had no idea that was unusual,<br>
    of course.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    It's such a strange place to be<br>
    born.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So was a manger.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A &quot;manger,&quot; sir?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I won't even try to explain that<br>
    one, Worf...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (calling)<br>
    I understand now, sir! I've got<br>
    this figured!</p>
  <p> Geordi moves in, indicating aspects of the area.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It was really very cleverly done<br>
    to make this look like a natural<br>
    hollow in the terrain here.<br>
    Signs of it being constructed<br>
    hurriedly...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>9 SPECIAL EFFECTS ANGLE</p>
  <p> Geordi moves to the rock face behind Data's &quot;birth<br>
    pallet,&quot; examining it very closely.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    ... as if to hide something here.</p>
  <p> Data nods, seeming to understand more of this now.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, that was it, Geordi.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    This has awakened a memory<br>
    remnant of how the colonists<br>
    hoped to remain hidden...<br>
    (beat; concentrating)<br>
    ... but their fear of being<br>
    discovered led to their storing<br>
    information in me.</p>
  <p> Geordi has brought his VISOR device within inches of<br>
    a point on the rock facing.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, I thought so.</p>
  <p> Geordi brings a finger carefully to an almost invisble<br>
    crack on the rock facing... presses! A HUMMING SOUND<br>
    and a SPECIAL EFFECT opening in the rock facing<br>
    APPEARS.</p>
  <p>10 INT. UNDERGROUND COMPLEX - ANGLE INTO THE ENTRY</p>
  <p> A curving tunnel. Geordi steps in closer, Riker and<br>
    Data pressing in next. Geordi reaches out, touching<br>
    something that suddenly ILLUMINATES the tunnel.<br>
    Tasha, duty always, steps forward and scans the tunnel.<br>
    Then to Riker:</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    No life readings in here either,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> Riker leads the way as the team cautiously heads into<br>
    the tunnel. Worf and Tasha flank him, weapons ready,<br>
    as they move into a rectangular corridor.</p>
  <p>11 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as they continue to an intersecting corridor which<br>
    features a familiar-looking type of sliding metal door.<br>
    Geordi again makes a close examination of this, then<br>
    touches a sensor switch. The sliding door OPENS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>12 INT. COLONY LABORATORY</p>
  <p> Similar to some very sophisticated things we've seen<br>
    on the Enterprise, the lab is filled with equipment<br>
    and instruments of the most sophisticated twenty-fourth century<br>
    level. In addition to workbenches, etc. there is a<br>
    prominent covered worktable which will figure in scenes<br>
    here. The team ENTERS with Tasha at the lead, weapon<br>
    in hand -- and with Worf professionally guarding their<br>
    rear at the door to the corridor they entered from.<br>
    Riker scans the lab.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The colony laboratory, I'd guess.<br>
    Extremely well equipped.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Does this place stir any memories,<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Only vague impressions of some<br>
    of my functions being tested<br>
    here, sir...</p>
  <p> Data indicates, moves toward a wall on which proud<br>
    scientist parents had posted their children's drawings.<br>
    Several of them PICTURE a crystal-like formation or<br>
    design, obviously huge judging from the very tiny<br>
    people who seem to be fleeing from it. Data pulls one<br>
    of these drawings free, hands it to Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Posted by a proud parent...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This pictures something that feels<br>
    familiar, sir. And dangerous,<br>
    although I have no idea what it<br>
    represents. And that is all...</p>
  <p> Then Data indicates a desk/workbench combination which<br>
    includes highly sophisticated-looking devices.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... except for an impression that<br>
    this was a... &quot;Doctor Soong's&quot;<br>
    work area.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Who? You can't mean Doctor<br>
    Noonien Soong?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    He was called that here...<br>
    although, his memories indicate<br>
    he traveled here under a different<br>
    name.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Doctor Noonien Soong, my friend,<br>
    just happens to have been Earth's<br>
    foremost robotics scientist!</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Until he tried to make Asimov's<br>
    dream of a positronic brain come<br>
    true.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    The positronic brain. He promised<br>
    it would do so much. When it<br>
    failed completely, Doctor Soong<br>
    disappeared.<br>
    (eyes Data)<br>
    Now we know he went off somewhere<br>
    to try a second time.<br>
    (turns; indicating)<br>
    Geordi, Data, we'll take a close<br>
    look at this lab.<br>
    (to Tasha)<br>
    You and Lieutenant Worf<br>
    reconnoiter where the rest of<br>
    these corridors lead.</p>
  <p> Tasha and Worf EXIT, AD LIBBING &quot;Aye, sir.&quot; Geordi<br>
    and Data choose areas to inspect while Riker<br>
    concentrates on the Soong workbench.</p>
  <p>13 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Riker moves to the large, thick laboratory table<br>
    mentioned earlier. Whatever they've found out about<br>
    it has lead Riker now to touch a control on it -- and<br>
    it now hinges apart HUMMING and presenting the torso<br>
    and head part of a human-shaped mold. Seeing what is<br>
    happening, Geordi and Data hurry over.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Data... it's you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - 10/26/87 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data hesitates, then reaches in and extracts a one-half<br>
    head and shoulders portion of the mold, presses it<br>
    against himself. It fits perfectly!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    An epidermal mold, I'd guess.<br>
    Made to give your exterior the<br>
    desired finish.</p>
  <p> TASHA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Lieutenant Yar to Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> Riker touches his insignia.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Come in, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> TASHA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Sir... this installation is big<br>
    enough to hold hundreds of people.<br>
    But all that's here now is empty<br>
    beds.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you, Lieutenant. Complete<br>
    your record scans, then report<br>
    back here.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sir...<br>
    (bends)<br>
    Seems to be a storage area here...</p>
  <p> Geordi has indeed discovered a storage area which he<br>
    now opens. All three of them look, REACT.</p>
  <p>14 ANGLE INCLUDING STORAGE AREA</p>
  <p> which REVEALS enough Data-like arms, torso and head<br>
    to startle us. It also startles our away team members.<br>
    The head looks surprisingly lifelike! (There are more<br>
    Data-like parts further back in the storage area,<br>
    apparontly enough to make up a whole Data if put<br>
    together.)</p>

    He needs assembling.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    &quot;He?&quot; Data, we don't know that<br>
    this could become &quot;alive.&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is of great interest to me to<br>
    find out, sir. I never believed it<br>
    possible I might have a link with<br>
    some form like my own.</p>

  <p> Picard, Riker, Geordi, Tasha, Worf and Wesley at their<br>

  <p> TASHA<br>
    Captain, I have a subspace reply<br>
    to your request.<br>
    (turns to Picard)<br>
    Starfleet considers it vital we<br>
    begin our ship's computer upgrade<br>
    at Starbase Armus Nine on<br>
    schedule.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (annoyed)<br>
    Damn. Can anyone see why they've<br>
    turned down a perfectly legitimate<br>
    request to finish this<br>
    investigation here?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (waits; then)<br>
    Sir... you asked for the kind of<br>
    computer upgrade that only the<br>
    Bynars can handle. And they're<br>
    available only at this time.</p>
  <p> Picard is at first annoyed at Wesley, then turns to<br>
    Riker, snapping an order:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then, get us there on schedule,<br>
    Number One.<br>
    (to Wesley; controlling<br>
    self)<br>
    Thank you, Wesley. I'd completely<br>

    the unassembled android which was discovered.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>

    ... we have discovered something<br>
    which may explain Data's<br>

    we've found.</p>
  <p>21 ANGLE EMPHASIZING DATA</p>
  <p> An expression of hope and longing on his face as he<br>
    watches the medical and engineering people at work on<br>
    the unassembled android.</p>
  <p> Doctor Beverly Crusher MOVES INTO SHOT with Data. She<br>
    understands what the unassembled android means to him<br>
    and her sympathy is obvious.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Signal from the captain. They<br>
    need you at the debriefing.</p>
  <p> Data nods as Chief Engineer Argyle MOVES INTO SHOT also,<br>
    his sympathy obvious too.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I've been anxious to hear the<br>
    chief engineer's opinion, Mister<br>
    Argyle. Do you believe he can<br>
    be made to function?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - 10/26/87 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ARGYLE<br>
    It appears to include all the<br>
    components in your body. Not that<br>
    we really understand your<br>
    construction either...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We'll have our top medical and<br>
    engineering specialists working<br>
    on its assembly, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> The Doctor and Engineer appear to hesitate over<br>
    something uncomfortable. Data nods at their previous<br>
    statement, moves as if to leave.</p>
  <p> ARGYLE<br>
    Just... one thing. Without<br>
    disassembling you, of course, if<br>
    we should need...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    ... If we should need to compare<br>
    this with the way... uh, with the<br>
    way you're put together... ?</p>
  <p> Data nods his answer, turns and EXITS.</p>
  <p>22 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Outside, the passing stars reflect the fact our<br>
    starship is at warp speed to make up for the delay at<br>
    Data's planet. On the table, the child's drawing of a<br>
    strange crystalline shape.</p>
  <p> Present are Picard, Riker, and Geordi. As before,<br>
    they will continue treating Data as a living person<br>
    but at times they may try a bit too hard to make that<br>
    feeling clear. For some, their first meeting with Data<br>
    was many years ago and they have long thought of him<br>
    simply as a fellow crewmember. Now, with the discovery<br>
    of the disassembled android form, they've been suddenly<br>
    reminded that their friend is also a machine. It<br>
    brings their emotions into play because they're<br>
    concerned for Data. How does he feel about this<br>
    remarkable happening? What should they say to him --<br>
    what words should they now use or not use? Meanwhile,<br>
    Picard is speaking to Riker:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - 10/26/87 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Bringing it up here was the right<br>
    thing to do, of course, Number<br>
    One.</p>
  <p> Picard trails his words as Data ENTERS and seats<br>
    himself. Despite themselves, everyone stiffens a bit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I was just saying, Data, that if<br>
    it functions, it might answer a<br>
    lot of questions for us.</p>
  <p> Data feels the tension too. He's sharing their<br>
    discomfort, merely nodding at the captain's comment.<br>
    An uncomfortable beat, then:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Does it appear to have all<br>
    your... ah, parts?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Completely, sir.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Will we know how to... to &quot;turn<br>
    it on?&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right, all right...<br>
    (stands; hesitates,<br>
    then)<br>
    Legitimate questions about this<br>
    need not be asked apologetically.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    You're uncomfortable about aspects<br>
    of your duplicate, Data... we're<br>
    uncomfortable, too... and none of<br>
    it for any logical reason. We<br>
    know that you're as &quot;alive&quot; as<br>
    any of the rest of us.<br>
    (to the others)<br>
    If you find it awkward to be<br>
    reminded that Data is a<br>
    &quot;machine&quot;... you might remember<br>
    that the rest of you are merely<br>
    a different variety of<br>
    machine... in our case,<br>
    electro-chemical in nature.<br>

    Let's begin handling this as we<br>
    would anything else.</p>
  <p> A grin has come over Riker's face during this and he<br>
    TAPS his knuckles on the table approvingly. Geordi<br>
    looks up, SLAPS the table.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Agreed! Love that captain!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (snaps)<br>
    My comments, Lieutenant, do not<br>
    require applause!</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, sir; sorry, sir.</p>
  <p> But as the captain now turns toward the others, Riker<br>
    flashes Data a big wink. Data looks puzzled.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's start with you, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Well... a good starting point might<br>
    be, &quot;Why was I given human form?&quot;</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    To make it easy for humans to<br>
    relate to you. Had to be. But<br>
    your designer may have had<br>
    something else to prove also.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    That human-shaped robots need not<br>
    be clumsy, limited things...<br>
    (turning)<br>
    You certainly operate as well as<br>
    we do, Data...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In some ways better, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah... yes! But the important<br>
    question now may be what happened<br>
    to the colonists.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - 10/26/87 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Agreed.<br>
    (exhibits child's<br>
    drawing)<br>
    One of several exhibited in the<br>
    lab, by proud parents, no doubt.<br>
    This could be simply a child's<br>
    imagination. But then, several<br>
    children made similar drawings.</p>
  <p> A COM SIGNAL, followed by:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Doctor Crusher to Captain. At<br>
    this point, sir, we very much need<br>
    Mister Data's help.</p>
  <p> Data is already coming to his feet as Picard gives him<br>
    a nod. As Data EXITS:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He's on his way, Doctor.</p>
  <p>23 INT. SICKBAY - DATA AND BEVERLY</p>
  <p> standing well away from the medical and engineering<br>
    technicians, talking quietly. Data presses a finger<br>
    at the spot which on humans would be between the second<br>
    and third joint of his spinal column. He also checks<br>
    that none of the others are watching too closely.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There, Doctor. Press your fingers<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> Beverly moves in and complies. Then a look of slight<br>
    surprise on her face.</p>
  <p>24 INSERT - BEVERLY'S HAND</p>
  <p> At the described spot on Data's back -- the fingers<br>
    pressing almost their full length through Data's<br>
    uniform fabric and into his back.</p>
  <p> DATA (O. S.)<br>
    It operates somewhat like a<br>
    &quot;switch,&quot; Doctor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - 10/27/87 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>25 BACK TO SHOT</p>
  <p> Beverly pressing further.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And these small projections?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    An android alarm clock, Doctor.<br>
    Is that amusing?<br>
    (sees it isn't)<br>
    It times how long I remain<br>
    unconscious.</p>
  <p> Beverly sees someone APPROACHING, quickly drops her<br>
    hand away. It is Chief Engineer Argyle who carries<br>
    what we'll later see are &quot;high temp heat molders&quot; used<br>
    to join together Data's &quot;skin.&quot;</p>
  <p> ARGYLE<br>
    Are you certain about us using<br>
    these heating devices, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I will feel nothing at all.</p>
  <p> ARGYLE<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Marvelous. It should all be a<br>
    lot simpler... once we can see how<br>
    your circuitry's connected.</p>
  <p> Argyle MOVES OFF to discuss the molding devices with<br>
    the Technicians. Beverly turns to Data who is watching<br>
    her closely, expectantly. She nods:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'll mention it to no one. You<br>
    have my word.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If you had an off-switch<br>
    Doctor... would you not keep it<br>
    secret?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I probably would.</p>

  <p> Two Data-like forms on two operating tables next to<br>
    each other. Neither of the Data look-alikes is moving,<br>
    and the torso of each is all but hidden by the medical<br>
    scanners over the tables. At one of the tables, the<br>
    mixed engineering and medical team is gathered. Argyle<br>
    and Beverly are reaching in, intent on what they are<br>
    seeing and doing.</p>
  <p>28 CLOSER ANGLE AT THE BUSY TABLE</p>
  <p> We're unable to tell whether this is Data or the<br>
    look-alike. Whichever, it is unmoving as Beverly and<br>
    Argyle lean in to peer closely at what is under the<br>

    been cut open TO REVEAL a bit of complex android body<br>

    FLICKERING. Argyle's hand is pointing a finger at<br>
    something.</p>

    connection here.</p>
  <p>30 ANGLE ON BEVERLY AND ARGYLE</p>
  <p> As he withdraws his hand, looks to her for<br>
    confirmation. Beverly nods, reaches for one of the<br>
    heat molding instruments.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

  <p> She reaches the heat molding instrument in under the<br>

  <p>31 CLOSE UNDER SENSOR HOOD (SPECIAL EFFECTS)</p>
  <p> as Beverly's hand presses the &quot;skin&quot; flap shut, applies<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Human language gives me<br>
    difficulties too, sir.<br>
    &quot;Imperfect&quot; could mean I lack<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I wonder. But the point of this<br>
    is whether you and it have<br>
    approximately the same<br>
    capabilities.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We do, sir, and your referring<br>
    to him as an &quot;it&quot;... suggests I<br>
    too fit into the category of a<br>

  <p> It is a fair shot at Picard and he recognizes it,<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see your point, Commander. My<br>
    sincere apologies.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Gladly accepted, sir. As for<br>

    was given human memories similar<br>

    I believe so, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (troubled)<br>
    Which requires I now ask you... a<br>
    very serious question. Since the<br>
    two of you are closely related<br>
    to each other...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The answer, sir, is that my<br>
    loyalty is to you and Starfleet.<br>
    Completely.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (beat; small smile)<br>
    Thank you, Commander. I was<br>
    certain of that.</p>
  <p>39 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Lore is now wearing a plain-colored utility uniform<br>
    without rank or insignia. It includes pocket-pouches<br>
    and a turtle-necked kind of undergarment beneath.<br>
    His only other difference from Data is in the fact he<br>
    often smiles (perhaps with a suggestion of<br>
    insincerity), plus his occasional facial &quot;tic&quot; or<br>
    twitch. He is now seated in Wesley's position at the<br>
    Helm next to Geordi who is pointing out various<br>
    controls. Wesley, standing behind that position, and<br>
    Riker at Command, seem a bit uncertain of this<br>
    android. The other regulars watch approvingly.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    And Helm control are here, with<br>
    the ship's heading given in<br>
    measurements, we call them<br>
    &quot;degrees&quot;...<br>
    (indicating)<br>
    ... with three hundred-sixty of<br>
    them in a full circle this way.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    ... Then you say &quot;mark&quot;...</p>

  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    On the nose!</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Which separates it from another<br>
    three hundred-sixty degree full<br>
    circle like this... on a right<br>
    angle to that one.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (demonstrating)<br>
    So by ordering a heading so many<br>
    degrees this way, and so many this<br>
    way, the ship can travel in any<br>
    direction. All three dimensions.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And the square of the hypotenuse<br>
    of a right triangle...</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Is equal to the sum of the square<br>
    of its other two...<br>
    (stops; covering)<br>
    ... its two &quot;somethings&quot;... which<br>
    I once heard but never understood.</p>
  <p> Riker and Wesley exchange a look at this juncture.<br>
    Data has stopped to watch this exchange with interest<br>
    also. Now, he moves toward Lore with a friendly tone.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    All of which you can learn more<br>
    about, when the captain has<br>
    approved your being on the bridge.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (surprise and<br>
    contrition)<br>
    Have I committed an offense?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (pleasantly)<br>
    You'll find as I have that<br>
    starships are loaded with rules<br>
    which have to be learned.</p>
  <p> But Wesley's expression also indicates he has begun to<br>
    have some doubts about Lore -- especially now when he<br>
    hears:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/28/87 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    You're very clever, Wesley.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    I now have duties to perform.<br>
    Correct?</p>
  <p> Except for Riker and Wesley, the rest of the bridge<br>
    crew is enjoying Lore.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Were you ever this anxious to<br>
    please, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Never. I judge Lore to be<br>
    superior in that desire as well.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Because I was designed to be so<br>
    human, my brother, I enjoy pleasing<br>
    humans.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    &quot;My brother.&quot; That has a nice<br>
    sound, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Lore)<br>
    And you consider it important to<br>
    please humans?</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    It's not important?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (beat)<br>
    There are many things of<br>
    importance... some more so than<br>
    others.</p>
  <p> Data indicates the turbolift, guides Lore in that<br>
    direction. Lore seems eager to cooperate as they EXIT<br>
    into the turbolift.</p>
  <p>41 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Data speaks toward the panel.</p>

    downward.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Is my brother that important?<br>
    It knows you?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It can identify any of the crew.<br>
    (eyes Lore)<br>
    Just as I can identify flattery,<br>
    brother.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    I used it only to please you, my<br>
    brother. Is that forbidden too?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is best used when it reflects<br>
    genuine feelings.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Then, I used it properly with you.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>

    Do you realize Commander Riker's<br>
    hypotenuse question tricked you<br>
    into showing your knowledge was<br>
    much greater than you were<br>
    indicating?</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    He didn't seem that clever. I'll<br>
    be more careful.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You tend to underestimate humans,<br>
    my brother. The way you praised<br>
    young Wesley at the Helm, for<br>
    example...</p>
  <p> LORE<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    He has a child's body, but we have<br>
    found him to be much more than that.</p>

    (beat; eyeing Data)<br>
    You do care about how I perform.<br>
    I pledge to be worthy of your<br>

  <p> Data looks at Lore for a long moment as they walk.</p>
  <p>42 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A plain, almost unfurnished interior. The door from<br>
    the corridor slides OPEN and Data ENTERS with Lore who<br>
    takes a moment to examine the quarters. They include<br>
    mainly a large computer, but little more.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    How would they describe this?<br>
    &quot;Spartan?&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have no need for places to sit<br>
    or sleep. Do you?</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Do I appear that weak?</p>
  <p> During which, Data has gone to his computer controls,<br>
    punched in an information request. The word DICTIONARY<br>
    COMES ONTO the viewer. Data touches the computer<br>
    controls again and CAMERA ZOOMS IN to show JEALOUSY<br>
    defined as &quot;INTOLERANCE OF RIVALRY, OR HOSTILITY TOWARD<br>
    A RIVAL OR ONE BELIEVED TO HOLD AN ADVANTAGE.&quot; CAMERA<br>
    ZOOMS BACK to an expressionless Data.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    What information are you<br>
    requesting?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Everything available on a Doctor<br>
    Noonien Soong.</p>
  <p> Information on Soong is COMING UP on the computer.<br>
    Lore moves in as Data studies it as he continues<br>
    talking with Lore who nods at the last statement.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - 10/26/87 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Good old &quot;Often-Wrong Soong.&quot;<br>
    (sees Data's puzzlement)<br>
    A joke, brother. Actually, he<br>
    was a genius by human standards.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (reading computer<br>
    viewer)<br>
    But had destroyed his own<br>
    reputation by making what seemed<br>
    wild promises about his positronic<br>
    brain design... almost all of which<br>
    failed.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Promises he later proved to be<br>

    Our beloved &quot;father.&quot;<br>
    (touches Data's uniform)<br>
    Will I soon have a uniform like<br>
    that, my brother?</p>
  <p> The casual mention of &quot;father&quot; and the fast switch to<br>
    uniforms bothers Data. His reply contains some<br>
    annoyance.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If you get one the way I did,<br>
    Lore, it means four years at the<br>
    Academy, another three as ensign,<br>
    ten or twelve on varied space duty<br>
    in the lieutenant grades...</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    ... A system designed to compensate<br>
    for limited human abilities.<br>
    But you, my brother, have begun<br>
    thinking as humans do. You and<br>
    I are completely different from<br>
    them. Are you truly satisfied<br>
    with the memories and knowledge<br>
    of just a few hundred human<br>
    colonists? Suppose it could<br>
    reflect thousands... or a<br>
    million... or the knowledge of<br>
    hundreds of millions of life forms<br>
    of every kind?</p>

  <p>42 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> They look at each other for a long beat. Lore's facial<br>
    &quot;tic&quot; happens again. Then:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    How?</p>
  <p> Oddly enough, Lore's face twitches again at that, too.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    We will discuss it in time.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And will we also discuss which<br>
    of us was constructed first?</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    It would be foolish to<br>
    underestimate you, my brother.<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Yes, I lied when I said you were<br>
    made first. With good reason.<br>
    Doctor Soong made me perfect on<br>
    his first attempt. But he made<br>
    me so completely human that the<br>
    colonists became envious of me.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You lived with the colonists?</p>
  <p> LORE<br>

    Until they petitioned Soong to<br>
    design a more comfortable, less<br>

  <p> Data and Lore sit looking at each other, until:</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    For example, haven't you noticed<br>
    how easily I handle human speech?<br>
    I use their contractions... such<br>

    have trouble with their humor,<br>
    too. Am I right?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (considers it; nods)<br>
    Quite true. I keep trying to be<br>

  <p> LORE<br>
    Do you realize, my brother, that<br>
    I can help you become more human?</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lore had been disassembled. He<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    uniform, lying unconscious on the floor neatly parallel<br>
    to a cabin wall. Wearing Data's uniform and rank<br>
    insignia is Lore, now speaking into the computer.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    ... and upon arriving here you can<br>
    identify me as the machine named<br>
    &quot;Data.&quot;</p>
  <p> Any doubts as to the true identity of this Android are<br>
    resolved at the sight of Lore's facial &quot;tic&quot; or twitch.<br>
    WE HEAR the door CHIME.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    End of message.<br>
    (turning computer off)<br>
    Come in, please.</p>
  <p> Wesley ENTERS, stops in surprise at the sight of an<br>
    android in utility uniform lying unconscious on the<br>
    floor.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Glad you are here, Wesley. Lore<br>
    suddenly attacked me and I had<br>
    to turn him off.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Why did he do that, Data?</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    He discovered we have been<br>
    using sensors to follow what<br>
    he does.</p>
  <p> Lore's facial twitch happens. Wesley REGISTERS<br>
    SURPRISE at this happening.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>52 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I practiced his facial &quot;tic.&quot;<br>
    Do I have it right?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'd suggest you forget imitating<br>
    him...<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    ... because if you had said &quot;We've<br>
    been using the sensors,&quot; instead<br>
    if &quot;we have,&quot; I might have<br>
    suspected you were Lore.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Yes. I do use language more<br>
    formally than Lore. Please<br>
    inform the captain I will come<br>
    up to the bridge...<br>
    (indicating unconscious<br>
    Form)<br>
    ... and report on this.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> CAMERA HOLDS ON LORE as Wesley EXITS. Then the facial<br>
    &quot;tic&quot; happens again and Lore turns to a cabinet and<br>
    extracts several hand devices, selects a heavy one.</p>
  <p>53 CLOSE ON LORE</p>
  <p> as he lifts the device to his face, touches a control<br>
    making it WHINE into power. Then another control which<br>
    causes it to BATHE THE FACIAL &quot;TIC&quot; AREA WITH<br>
    ELECTRONIC DISCHARGES WHICH APPEAR AS MINIATURE<br>
    &quot;LIGHTNING BOLTS.&quot; He keeps at this &quot;treatment&quot; until<br>
    that part of his face BEGINS TO GLOW. Then he lowers<br>
    the device and as the GLOW FADES, then works his facial<br>
    muscles, testing them.</p>
  <p>54 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> still traveling at high warp against a star background.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/29/87 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>55 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Any angles on the Main Viewer SHOW the same high warp<br>
    speed. The full bridge crew we saw earlier is on duty,<br>
    Wesley back at the Helm position, Beverly seated in<br>
    the Command Area again. Data hasn't returned, of<br>
    course. Picard ENTERS from his Ready Room, reflecting<br>
    annoyance as he speaks to Wesley.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're certain he said he'll be<br>
    right up?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    He indicated that, sir.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Sensors show Data just now<br>
    entering a turbolift, sir.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    Wes, tell me again how Data said<br>
    he immobilized Lore.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    He said he &quot;turned him off,&quot; Mom...<br>
    (quick correction)<br>
    ... uh, Doctor.</p>
  <p> Lore, in Data's uniform, ENTERS by turbolift. Beverly<br>
    eyes him, puzzled.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    Question, Mister Data... did you<br>
    or did you not swear me to secrecy<br>
    about your &quot;off switch?&quot;</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (a slight hesitation)<br>
    A change of mind, Doctor. If I<br>
    cannot trust the bridge crew, whom<br>
    can I... ?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (interrupting; to<br>
    Picard)<br>
    Sir! I'm picking up a &quot;bogey&quot;<br>
    coming in on a five o'clock<br>
    tangent.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/28/87 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>55 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Confirm! And so fast it makes<br>
    our warp eight look like we're<br>
    standing still!</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    It's transmitting no ID signal,<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Set Main Viewer on that tangent.</p>
  <p> Main Viewer SWITCHES to the indicated REAR ANGLE,<br>
    changing the relative star movement accordingly. As<br>
    the view magnifies, WE CAN SEE A TINY BRIGHT SPOT WHICH<br>
    STEADILY GROWS LARGER.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Shields up; go to Yellow Alert!<br>
    Transmit friendly greetings, all<br>
    languages, all frequencies.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can't believe anything<br>
    overtaking us this fast.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Beautiful, isn't it?</p>
  <p> Wesley pivots, EXPRESSING SURPRISE at this. The rest<br>
    of the bridge crew is too busy at their readings and<br>
    controls to notice.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I recognize it, Captain... it's<br>
    similar to that child's drawing...</p>
  <p> WE CAN NOW SEE that the IMAGE (computer generated?)<br>
    IS SHAPED LIKE THE CRYSTAL COMPLEX.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    My God, it's big!</p>
  <p>55A EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND CRYSTAL ENTITY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> MOVING IN to float close to our starship, the<br>
    SHIMMERING CRYSTAL COMPLEXITY is very obvious. It<br>
    looks both very lovely and terribly powerful at the<br>
    same time.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT FIVE 45.</p>
  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>56 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND CRYSTAL ENTITY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The huge crystal form, two or three times the size of<br>
    the starship, SLOWLY SPINNING, pictorially dominating<br>
    the starship as it floats next to it.</p>
  <p>57 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The complex crystal IMAGE on Main Viewer, still<br>
    SHIMMERING as it SLOWLY TURNS. Watching it are Picard,<br>
    Riker, Wesley, Tasha, Worf and &quot;Lore.&quot;</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Still no ID transmitted, sir.<br>
    Also, no answer to our inquiries.</p>
  <p> Geordi ENTERS hurriedly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Did you have a direct look at it?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's like a snowflake crystal,<br>
    sir. But much more complex... the<br>
    entire electromagnetic spectrum<br>
    seems to play about inside it...<br>
    (seeing Picard's look)<br>
    I haven't the slightest idea what<br>
    it is, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, anything else Lore can tell<br>
    us about it may be important.<br>
    Can you control Lore enough to<br>
    question him?</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (rising; moving to<br>
    turbolift)<br>
    I'll have to examine him to know,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> Wesley, who has reacted uncomfortably to all this,<br>
    comes to his feet.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - 10/26/87 - ACT FIVE 46.</p>
  <p>57 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Captain, recommend you do not<br>
    let...<br>
    (hesitates)<br>
    ... him move around the ship alone.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign... !</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (interrupting;<br>
    chuckling)<br>
    Wesley is only trying to show<br>
    himself alert and responsible,<br>
    sir.<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    Something to encourage. Come,<br>
    you can watch everything I do.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Not if I have a choice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That is quite enough, Ensign!<br>
    When addressing a senior<br>
    officer...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    I've guided his training; I'm the<br>
    one at fault, sir.<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    You will show proper courtesy,<br>
    and I'm taking you down there to<br>
    make certain of it!<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    With your approval, of course,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> Picard gives a wave of approval to Riker and a look<br>
    of annoyance to Wesley.</p>
  <p>58 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> as last seen, with Data unconscious on the floor. The<br>
    door opens with Lore very cleverly managing to block<br>
    Riker's and Wesley's view as he takes a precautionary<br>
    look inside.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT FIVE 47.</p>
  <p>58 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Careful of Lore...<br>
    (steps aside)<br>
    Good, he is still unconscious.</p>
  <p> Wesley ENTERS with Riker.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (continuing; to Wesley)<br>
    The captain refused to listen to<br>
    you but you were right... Lore<br>
    can be extremely dangerous.</p>
  <p> Lore has knelt with an arm going behind Data,<br>
    pretending to lift his head more upright to examine his<br>
    face. Then, even though unconscious, Data's face<br>
    twitches.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Notice? The same twitch, even<br>
    when he's unconscious... I suspect<br>
    that...</p>
  <p>59 REVERSE CLOSE ANGLE</p>
  <p> On Data's back where Lore's hand, hidden from view,<br>
    probes fingers toward the &quot;switch&quot; deep in Data's back.</p>
  <p> LORE (O.S.)<br>
    ... something went seriously wrong<br>
    during Lore's construction.</p>
  <p>60 BACK TO SHOT</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Stay back. We could have a<br>
    problem if he senses someone else<br>
    is near.<br>
    (bringing android<br>
    closer)<br>
    Lore, I have some questions to<br>
    ask you...</p>
  <p> Data's eyes flicker open, rolling about.</p>
  <p>61 REVERSE ANGLE</p>
  <p> Again on Data's back -- Lore's fingers jabbing<br>
    viciously at the &quot;switch&quot; area.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - 10/26/87 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p>62 BACK TO SHOT</p>
  <p> Data's head begins to jerk about, then begins doing<br>
    it more and more violently and he begins making PAINED<br>
    SOUNDS -- then struggles as if to sit up, Lore<br>
    pretending to hold him down.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Lore, it is Data. I have a few<br>
    easy questions for you...<br>
    (pretending to control<br>
    Data)<br>
    He senses you!<br>
    (Data begins flailing)<br>
    I'm sorry, I can't control him<br>
    if you stay.</p>
  <p> Wesley is still uncertain, but Riker feels obliged to<br>
    obey Picard's orders. He moves Wesley toward the door.<br>
    Data is beginning to flail rather wildly.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Please! I'll record anything he<br>
    says!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And bring it to the bridge.<br>
    Immediately!</p>
  <p> The cabin door IS OPENED as Riker GUIDES Wesley OUT.<br>
    Then the doors CLOSE. Then, Lore releases Data who<br>
    falls back prone and unconscious again.</p>
  <p>63 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Lore still turned toward the door area, an ugly<br>
    expression now on Lore's face.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    And you want to be as stupid as<br>
    them... ?</p>
  <p> Lore suddenly KICKS HARD at Data's head, knocking it<br>
    violently aside.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... dear brother!</p>
  <p> He kicks again. Then again.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>64 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> where Riker and Wesley are moving back to their<br>
    positions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sir, it's Lore... with the same<br>
    facial twitch we've all seen...<br>
    lying unconscious exactly as Data<br>
    described. But he became violent,<br>
    apparently sensing that Wesley<br>
    and I were present...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Or is it Lore pretending to be<br>
    Data, and faking it all?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I asked for Commander Riker's<br>
    report, &quot;Acting Ensign&quot; Crusher.<br>
    And since it is now clear you are<br>
    unable to function here within<br>
    the limits of that appointment...</p>
  <p> Wesley has come to his feet expecting the worst but all<br>
    is now interrupted:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain!</p>
  <p> Picard whirls at the sound of alarm in Geordi's<br>
    voice... and sees that the huge crystal shape is rapidly<br>
    MOVING IN toward the Enterprise. Reaching the<br>
    deflector shields area, it is deflected back somewhat,<br>
    but the smaller Enterprise is JOLTED MORE, SHAKING THE<br>
    BRIDGE CREW ABOUT.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Deflector shields holding, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (keeping voice calm)<br>
    Bring photon torpedoes to ready;<br>
    main phasers to ready...</p>
  <p> A flurry of activity from Tasha and Worf. Wesley has<br>
    quickly seated himself again, checking his controls as<br>
    the immense crystal shape now COMES AT THE ENTERPRISE<br>
    HARDER. The SHAKING this time is HEAVIER, and WE BEGIN<br>
    TO HEAR the SOUND OF STRUCTURAL STRAIN. Beverly COMES<br>
    OUT of a turbolift, concerned.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - 10/26/87 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>64 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing: to Riker)<br>
    Go to Red Alert, please.</p>
  <p> Riker hits a control and the ALERT SIGNAL begins<br>
    HONKING, the RED LIGHTS begin FLASHING. And Lore,<br>
    still in Data's uniform, COMES OUT of a turbolift on<br>
    the run.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (raising voice over it)<br>
    Weapons now ready, sir!</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    No, Captain, let me talk to it...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Why didn't you say you could?</p>
  <p> Interrupted by the CRYSTAL SHAPE COMING at the<br>
    Enterprise still HARDER, with STRUCTURAL STRAIN HEARD<br>
    MUCH LOUDER this time. The shaking makes Lore grab<br>
    support as:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Affirmative! Talk to it!</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (whirling to Tasha)<br>
    Open hailing frequencies!<br>
    (as she hits switch)<br>
    Crystal Form, I identify myself<br>
    as &quot;Data,&quot; advising you to stop<br>
    your attack. The humans here are<br>
    powerful, capable of injuring or<br>
    even destroying you. They can<br>
    be changed only in other ways.</p>
  <p> The crystal shape stops, begins to BACK OFF from the<br>
    Enterprise, taking its earlier position.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Now I call that communicating.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But he mentioned &quot;changing us,&quot;<br>
    Captain. What does that mean?</p>
  <p> Wesley looks back toward Worf thankfully.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/29/87 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>64 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    It has many meanings, as any human<br>
    language dictionary could inform<br>
    you.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Suggest moving fast to confirm<br>
    what I told it, sir. Permission<br>
    to use the large transporter in<br>
    Cargo Room Three? There I can<br>
    beam out some living pattern,<br>
    perhaps a large tree...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Which you'll beam over next to<br>
    the entity...</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    You are correct, Riker.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Our ship's phasers will then blast<br>
    and disintegrate it... proving<br>
    we're dangerous.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so!</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> Which brings a slight change of expression onto<br>
    Picard's features.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do it!</p>
  <p> Lore EXITS via turbolift. Wesley has come to his feet,<br>
    protesting.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Sir, I know this may finish me<br>
    as an acting ensign, but...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Shut up, Wesley.<br>
    (turning)<br>
    Lieutenant Yar, pick a good<br>
    security team, let me know what<br>
    he does.</p>
  <p> Yar turns to Worf, silently requesting him to handle<br>
    it. Worf gives a brisk &quot;Aye, sir,&quot; EXITING via<br>
    turbolift.</p>
  <p> Beverly has been watching Picard, troubled.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - 10/26/87 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>64 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    &quot;Shut up, Wesley?&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stay out of this, Madam...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Since I am finished here, Captain,<br>
    may I point out... ?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Shut up, Wesley!</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (still to Picard)<br>
    ... that what I've said would have<br>
    been listened to if it came from<br>
    an adult officer. Request<br>
    permission to return to my<br>
    quarters, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Granted, if you take your mother<br>
    with you.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (flaring)<br>
    You're putting me off the bridge?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm asking that you keep an eye<br>
    on your son during this, Doctor.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Please, Mom. Let's go.</p>
  <p> A hesitant Beverly lets Wesley accompany her to a<br>
    turbolift.</p>
  <p>65 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> where Worf and two Security People hurry toward a<br>
    turbolift door there. It OPENS... REVEALING Lore<br>
    waiting there. Worf REACTS, quickly steps toward Lore.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Emergency close!</p>
  <p> Causing the turbolift doors to CLOSE in the face of<br>
    the Security People.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/29/87 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>66 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Worf, alone with Lore in the small cab, whirls toward<br>
    the android.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Now show me your warrior<br>
    fierceness.</p>
  <p> Worf draws his small phaser fast... and Lore chops it<br>
    from his hand even faster. Worf pivots, his fist<br>
    striking powerfully at Lore who moves very fast,<br>
    deflects it and chops again at Worf, bringing a look of<br>
    surprised pain to Worf's face. Like a windmill, Lore<br>
    chops at Worf with one hand, then the next, then again<br>
    with the other -- and WE SEE Worf's knees beginning<br>
    to buckle.</p>
  <p>67 OMITTED</p>
  <p>68 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> with Data crumpled in a heap on the floor. No blood or<br>
    bruises appear on an android, but the epidermal<br>
    covering of his head is damaged, with pieces of it<br>
    hanging down.</p>
  <p> WE HEAR a CHIME. Then a wait, then a MECHANICAL SOUND<br>
    AT THE DOOR which slides open TO REVEAL Wesley there<br>
    with Beverly who now has a major phaser on her belt.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'll look, but I should never<br>
    have let you talk me into this...</p>
  <p> But Wesley presses ON INTO the room... then REACTS at<br>
    what he finds.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's Data, Mom. He's been hurt!</p>
  <p> Beverly COMES IN too, kneels at the utility-clad Form<br>
    there. Then the facial twitch happens. Beverly looks<br>
    up at Wesley, alarmed.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's Data! For once will you<br>
    trust me about something?</p>
  <p> Beverly looks questioningly at the unconscious android<br>
    form.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/29/87 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>68 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You must know how much Starfleet<br>
    means to me. But I'm finished<br>
    unless you can help me.<br>
    (touches her arm)<br>
    I heard you know how to turn them<br>
    on. Please?</p>
  <p> Beverly pulls away, starts to rise.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No, this is very serious...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I know, Mom. So tell me again<br>
    to &quot;shut up, Wesley,&quot; and I will.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're being very unfair,<br>
    Wesley...</p>
  <p> But Beverly still reaches to Data's back... then Data<br>
    opens his eyes and sits upright, examining Beverly and<br>
    Wesley.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Data, the Crystal Thing is outside<br>
    close to the ship... and Lore is<br>
    loose somewhere inside.</p>
  <p> Data comes to his feet. A loose piece of epidermal<br>
    covering FLUTTERS to the floor, causing him to run a<br>
    hand over his facial damage.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How badly are you hurt... Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will function sufficiently to<br>
    stop Lore, Doctor...</p>
  <p> Wesley is already OUT the door. Beverly and Data hurry<br>
    to FOLLOW.</p>
  <p>69 INT. CORRIDOR TO CARGO THREE</p>
  <p> Data, Beverly, Wesley hurry to a small door marked<br>
    &quot;TRANSPORTER TECHNICIANS ONLY.&quot;</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>69 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Whatever happens, it is important<br>
    that you two stay away from him.<br>
    Do not try to help me.</p>
  <p> Both Wesley and Beverly nod agreement. Data tries the<br>
    door, it doesn't budge. Data gives an &quot;I thought so&quot;<br>
    nod, turns to a panel next to the door, punches in a<br>
    code... then easily pushes the door open.</p>
  <p>70 INT. CARGO THREE TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> The small door has led to the Transporter Control Area.<br>
    Beyond past the large Transporter Platform are large<br>
    cargo doors used for bringing bulky cargo items in and<br>
    out. As Data, Beverly and Wesley ENTER, they stop,<br>
    freeze as they hear:</p>
  <p> LORE (O.S.)<br>
    Good, you understand perfectly<br>
    so far. Next, I'll signal I'm<br>
    about to transport something<br>
    out...</p>
  <p> Data is now moving in quietly, motioning Doctor and son<br>
    to stay back.</p>
  <p>71 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Lore standing at a computer where Data can see him now.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... at which time the deflector<br>
    shields will turn off for a<br>
    moment, and if you move in at<br>
    that time...</p>
  <p> Lore suddenly stops in mid-sentence, turns and looks<br>
    directly at Data. Then, as if sensing someone else<br>
    there, Lore steps unexpectedly to one side... sees<br>
    Wesley and Beverly there.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    How sad, dear brother. You have<br>
    made me wish I were an only child.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - 10/26/87 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>71 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (raising phaser)<br>
    Then why this marvelous gift, my<br>
    brother? The troublesome little<br>
    man-child.<br>
    (circling; to Wesley)<br>
    Are you prepared for the kind of<br>
    death you've earned, little man?</p>
  <p> This is too much for Beverly. She draws her major<br>
    phaser, aiming it at Lore.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If you take one step toward my<br>
    son...</p>
  <p> Startled, Data takes his eyes off Lore for just a<br>
    fraction of a second... enough for Lore to send Data<br>
    spinning to where he blocks Beverly's aim. Wesley<br>
    tries to move in to help but Lore has already chopped<br>
    again at Data, spinning into Beverly, easily taking<br>
    the phaser away from her. He makes a quick setting<br>
    on it. Data is coming to his feet to attack Lore.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Ah, motherhood!<br>
    (aims phaser at Wesley)<br>
    Back off or I'll turn your little<br>
    man into a torch!</p>
  <p> Frightened for Wesley, Beverly backs off. Lore makes<br>
    another quick setting, holding phaser on Wesley.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    I promise him exquisite pain<br>
    unless you obey me too, dear<br>
    brother.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Move away, Data, please!</p>
  <p> Data backs off a few steps.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Do you see now the advantages of<br>
    being completely human?<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    It includes kindness. I give you<br>
    your life, Doctor. Go, quickly<br>
    and I may not injure your son at<br>
    all.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - 10/26/87 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>71 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Beverly is willing to die if it helps her son. But<br>
    leaving him this way?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will stay with Wesley, Doctor.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Go! Or he'll be shrieking on the<br>
    count of five. One... two...</p>
  <p>72 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL &amp; SPECIAL EFFECTS)</p>
  <p> Beverly panics, hurries toward the small door where<br>
    they had entered.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'll bring help, Wesley.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Thank you for my human quality,<br>
    Doctor Soong.<br>
    (aiming phaser)<br>
    Now a small payment for your son's<br>
    misdeeds.</p>
  <p> LORE PHASERS BEVERLY, a BEAM which strikes her left<br>
    arm in a FLASH OF FIRE.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Mom!</p>
  <p> Wesley turns, rushing at Lore... but Data reaches out,<br>
    stopping Wesley and holding him immobile. Meanwhile,<br>
    the PHASER BEAM has IGNITED Beverly's MEDICAL COAT<br>
    which she must now tear away one-handed, opening the<br>
    door the same way. As the EXITS, the door CLOSES but<br>
    with Lore distracted with the door, Data leaps at him<br>
    fast, shoving Wesley tumbling to safety. It is a<br>
    vicious android battle, both using incredible speed<br>
    and power. It SURGES OUT into the open room, toward<br>
    the big transporter platform.</p>
  <p>73<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    74</p>
  <p>75 ANGLE ON WESLEY</p>
  <p> coming to his feet, alert to anything he can do to help<br>
    Data. He moves toward the conflict.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/29/87 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>75 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Stay back, Wesley! Help me some<br>
    other way!</p>
  <p> Wesley backs off. Data and Lore in action that now<br>
    SURGES toward the transporter platform. Wesley,<br>
    desperately seeking some way to help, sees their<br>
    direction of movement... turns quickly toward the<br>
    transporter controls. Can this be it?</p>
  <p>76 EMPHASIZING DATA AND LORE</p>
  <p> at the edge of the transporter platform. Data now sees<br>
    where Wesley is standing -- he pretends to stumble,<br>
    faking Lore in over him -- then surges up to his full<br>
    height, tossing Lore onto the platform.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Wesley... now!</p>
  <p>77 ANGLE ON WESLEY</p>
  <p> already moving the controls.</p>
  <p>78 ANGLE EMPHASIZING LORE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as he is beamed out into oblivion.</p>
  <p>79 ANGLE ON SMALL DOOR</p>
  <p> as it is FORCED OPEN, Picard, Riker, Tasha, with an<br>
    injured Beverly RUSH IN. Wesley rushes to his mother,<br>
    worried about her injuries.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Lore's gone, sir, permanently!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    Now that your son's safe, Doctor,<br>
    report immediately to Sickbay.</p>
  <p> Riker has noticed something happening on the computer<br>
    view screen.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain... The crystal thing has<br>
    begun to move away.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT FIVE 58A.</p>
  <p>79A EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND CRYSTAL SHAPE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the crystal thing MOVES AWAY from the starship,<br>
    accellerating, DISAPPEARING quickly into the distance.</p>
  <p>79B INT. CARGO THREE TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> as a figure, clothed like Lore, MOVES IN toward the<br>
    Captain. As Picard looks him over, its face twitches.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing; beat;<br>
    eyeing him)<br>
    Data, get rid of that damned<br>
    twitch! And put on a correct<br>
    uniform.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Datalore&quot; - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>79B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Captain.</p>
  <p> Data EXITS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And Ensign Crusher...<br>
    (as Wesley HURRIES IN)<br>
    ... are you able to return to duty<br>
    now?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then do so! Let the bridge know<br>
    all is well down here.</p>
  <p> Wesley HURRIES OFF too. Riker turns from another look<br>
    at at the view screen.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's gone, sir. Without Lore, it<br>
    had no way to reach us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    And we're overdue for our computer<br>
    refit.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Number One, have you ever<br>
    considered whether Data is more<br>
    human, or less human than we want?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (grins)<br>
    I only wish we were as well<br>
    balanced, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (beat; nods)<br>
    Agreed!</p>
  <p> The two of them begin to EXIT.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
