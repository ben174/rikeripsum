  <p> STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION <br>
    &quot;Code of Honor&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The great ship moving into orbit of planet Ligon.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 41235.25.<br>
    Our location planet Ligon II,<br>
    source of a rare vaccine needed<br>
    on Federation planet Styris IV.<br>
    Starfleet has instructed me...</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> Full complement of crew at stations, DATA at OPS, GEORDI<br>
    at CONN. RIKER and TROI are flanking PICARD.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... to engage in a friendly visit<br>
    and open treaty negotiations to<br>
    acquire this medicinal substance.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Standard orbit, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lieutenant Yar is calling from<br>
    Cargo Bay One, sir. Standing by<br>
    to beam Ligonian welcoming party<br>
    aboard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (rising)<br>
    On our way. You have the helm,<br>
    Mister Data.</p>
  <p> Picard leads Riker and Troi into FORWARD Turbolift.</p>
  <p>3 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> as Picard, Riker and Troi ENTER and the door HISSES<br>
    closed behind them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/9/87 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing; toward<br>
    controls)<br>
    Cargo One.<br>
    (to Riker and Troi)<br>
    Should be an interesting<br>
    experience.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Agreed. Not only are they closely<br>
    humanoid but their history has<br>
    remarkable similarities to ours.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But a highly structured society<br>
    and they're exceedingly proud.</p>
  <p>4 INT. CARGO DECK (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker and Troi ENTER. Tasha is waiting there<br>
    with a pair of SECURITY GUARDS -- one with a tricorder.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    They've insisted on using their<br>
    own transporter device, sir...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    It's their way, Lieutenant. Do<br>
    they have our coordinates?</p>
  <p> Tasha indicates cleared area ahead of them on the Cargo<br>
    Bay deck.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    They have, sir. Precisely. And<br>
    they're standing by for your<br>
    signal.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is Captain Picard of the<br>
    Starfleet vessel Enterprise.<br>
    Please...<br>
    (looks to Troi; she<br>
    nods)<br>
    ... please do us the honor of<br>
    visiting our vessel.</p>
  <p> After only a moment, a slightly different kind of<br>
    TRANSPORTER EFFECT materializes five people. There are<br>
    four extremely tall, elegant Black Guards who form a<br>
    square.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - 7/2/87 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> They are bare-waisted with metal collars -- each with a<br>
    centered jewel -- and each wears a hakama (starched,<br>
    baggy trousers pulled between the legs).</p>
  <p> Each has at least one major scar, and each carries a<br>
    bo (a bojutsu fighting staff). Each wears as headgear<br>
    a red, braided rope in a circular crown. One carries<br>
    a rolled carpet. They face forward at attention, but<br>
    their eyes take in everything.</p>
  <p> The fifth person materializing is HAGON, who carries a<br>
    dull metallic box. He bends down and kicks the carpet<br>
    so that it unrolls towards Picard.</p>
  <p> Then, LUTAN beams into view. He stands a moment, tall,<br>
    magnificent and with flashing eyes. His dress is more<br>
    elegant, his jewel more resplendent. The Security Guard<br>
    with the tricorder scans the party quickly, then nods to<br>
    Tasha.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (quietly to Picard)<br>
    Nothing concealed, sir.</p>
  <p> Lutan steps forward. He looks about him for a moment.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    I am Lutan.</p>
  <p> Picard moves to greet him, raising both hands in the<br>
    customary Ligonian greeting to show one is not holding<br>
    a weapon. Lutan nods, satisfied, and smiles. Without<br>
    touching, he holds his hands up in a like manner.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome<br>
    aboard. These are my officers.<br>
    Second in command, Commander<br>
    William Riker; Ship's Counselor<br>
    Deanna Troi; my security officer,<br>
    Lieutenant Tasha Yar.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    A woman? Your Chief of Security?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Lutan: that is her expertise.</p>
  <p> Lutan and Hagon exchange a near-amused look. Then Lutan<br>
    turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - 7/2/87 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    I am honored to meet your<br>
    officers.<br>
    (indicates Hagon)<br>
    And this is my Secondary, Hagon.<br>
    (indicates)<br>
    A sample of the vaccine.</p>
  <p> Hagon steps forward with the metal box, extending it<br>
    to Picard. But Tasha steps forward to take it.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    My duty, Lutan.</p>
  <p> Almost before the words are out of Tasha's mouth, Hagon<br>
    grabs for the box.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Sorry, I am required to inspect...</p>
  <p> HAGON<br>
    Aside, little one...</p>
  <p> Hagon whirls toward Picard forcing Picard to step back<br>
    to avoid contact, but Tasha reacts protecting her<br>
    Captain, with it ending in Hagon being flipped onto his<br>
    back. Lutan's guards step forward menacingly but are<br>
    stopped by a gesture from Lutan. Hagon looks up from<br>
    his prone position, more puzzled than anything else.</p>
  <p> HAGON<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This... this is a woman?</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    (inspecting Tasha)<br>
    How interesting!<br>
    (then, to Picard)<br>
    May we prove as surprising to you.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/9/87 5.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>5 INT. CARGO DECK - FULL SHOT</p>
  <p> Same principals in approximately the same positions as<br>
    last SCENE.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (low voice)<br>
    If I may suggest, sir...</p>
  <p> She indicates for the Enterprise people to move back<br>
    and give Lutan and his people room and also time to<br>
    recover. In just above a whisper:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    No apology. In their view, it<br>
    would weaken us.</p>
  <p>6 EMPHASIZING LUTAN</p>
  <p> Unlike Hagon and the Guards, he's beginning to enjoy<br>
    this as Riker picks up the container Hagon had been<br>
    holding, examines it and extends it to Picard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Nothing concealed, Captain.<br>
    (extends it)<br>
    Do you care to accept it?</p>
  <p> HAGON<br>
    Yes, yes, please do.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    (to Tasha)<br>
    Unless you care to examine it<br>
    further.</p>
  <p>7 CLOSER GROUP SHOT</p>
  <p> Picard seeing it is time to turn on the charm.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Absolutely not. This vaccine<br>
    sample is a gift of life and we<br>
    are honored at receiving it.<br>
    (indicates way into<br>
    vessel)<br>
    Will you do us the honor of<br>
    letting us entertain you now?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/10/87 6.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    You may prepare it. We will join<br>
    you shortly.</p>
  <p> With nothing else to do, the Enterprise group LEAVES the<br>
    immediate area. They're not fools -- security people<br>
    remain in sight. Lutan and Hagon move closer together,<br>
    speak in low tones.</p>
  <p> HAGON<br>
    I ask forgiveness....</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    (cuts him off)<br>
    They are strange alien things.<br>
    You bear no fault...</p>
  <p> HAGON<br>
    But the female...</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    May be exactly what I've needed.</p>
  <p>8 INT. LOUNGE - FULL SHOT</p>
  <p> Data, BEVERLY and Troi are seen ENTERING, Data carrying<br>
    a magnificent bronze horse. Picard stands next to<br>
    Lutan.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lutan, we're aware of many of your<br>
    planet's achievements, and its<br>
    unique similarity to an ancient<br>
    Earth culture, which we all<br>
    admire. On behalf of the<br>
    Federation, therefore, I am proud<br>
    to present to you this token of<br>
    gratitude and friendship. From<br>
    China's Sung Dynasty, Fourteenth<br>
    Century.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Thirteenth Century, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Indeed?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/10/87 6A.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    (accepting and admiring<br>
    it)<br>
    It is a most thoughtful gift.<br>
    We are grateful.</p>
  <p> Lutan hands the horse to Hagon. Then, while watching<br>
    Tasha with interest:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/10/87 7.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We from Ligon have always been<br>
    apprehensive about strangers.<br>
    We are not as technologically<br>
    advanced as you; yet we possess<br>
    something you do not -- a vaccine<br>
    which has been found to be an<br>
    effective antidote to your deadly<br>
    Anchilles fever. If your conduct<br>
    toward us is worthy -- if you<br>
    respect our customs -- and if we<br>
    see this respect -- we will<br>
    become friends. Then, we will<br>
    make the vaccine available to all<br>
    who need it.</p>
  <p> Everyone APPLAUDS. Lutan is proud and dignified. He<br>
    sweeps the gathering with his eyes, which hold on Tasha.</p>
  <p>9 CLOSE SHOT - TASHA</p>
  <p> She meets his gaze with confidence.</p>
  <p>10 BACK TO FULL SHOT</p>
  <p> The room quiets down as Picard rises.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you require respect from us,<br>
    I'm certain you will see it.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    Surrounded by such friendship,<br>
    I have no need of my guards.<br>
    (to guards)<br>
    I will return shortly. Prepare<br>
    to transport me then.</p>
  <p> The Guards signal obedience, begin EXITING. Picard and<br>
    the others are puzzled by this.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - 7/2/87 8.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If there is something else, any<br>
    final courtesy...</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    Is it possible to see one of your<br>
    wondrous holodecks? We have heard<br>
    how they are used to train your<br>
    officers.</p>
  <p> Picard exchanges a quick, concerned look with Riker and<br>
    Troi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And used for many other things<br>
    too.<br>
    (turning)<br>
    Commander Riker, perhaps you and<br>
    Counselor Troi can demonstrate.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    Is it possible for Lieutenant Yar<br>
    to do so Captain? Some<br>
    demonstration of defense training?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've noticed you are intrigued<br>
    by her having security<br>
    responsibilities. But such things<br>
    are not at all unusual with us.</p>
  <p> HAGON<br>
    With us, it is the duty of women<br>
    only to own the land, and the duty<br>
    of men to protect and rule it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (amused)<br>
    Much the same has happened in<br>
    human history too.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles, then turns to Tasha questioningly. She<br>
    nods.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    I'd like to do it, sir.<br>
    (to Lutan)<br>
    As a sign of respect, perhaps.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods agreement)<br>
    Very well.</p>
  <p> Tasha beckons to Lutan and Hagon.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - 7/2/87 9.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    This way, please.</p>
  <p> A couple of Enterprise Security Guards follow.</p>
  <p>11 INT. HOLODECK - FULL SHOT - OPTICAL (SPLIT SCREEN)</p>
  <p> Tasha, followed by Lutan and Hagon, plus the two<br>
    security team members, who stay in the b.g. Tasha moves<br>
    to the wall controls. She punches in some commands,<br>
    reaches for an aikido jacket from a peg, then walks to<br>
    a bare area. She gives a CODED COMMAND.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Aikido. One.</p>
  <p> An Aikido Opponent MATERIALIZES (DISSOLVES IN) ON A MAT.<br>
    The IMAGE remains rigid, immobile. The visitors are<br>
    much impressed.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing; amicably)<br>
    It won't move until my actions<br>
    activate it.</p>
  <p>12 CLOSER ON GROUP</p>
  <p> Lutan stepping in to examine the Aikido Opponent,<br>
    amazed.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    You can create people? Without<br>
    a soul?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    It's not a real person, Lutan.<br>
    It has no life. Everything it<br>
    does is controlled by computer.</p>
  <p> She moves close to the image.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing; to the<br>
    image)<br>
    Who am I? Do you hear me?</p>
  <p> The image doesn't move. But when Tasha suddenly feints,<br>
    the image instantly blocks the blow.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - 7/2/87 10.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But it will feel real when it hits<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> She crouches and the IMAGE crouches, and they begin to<br>
    fight. After rapid and savage exchange, she throws the<br>
    IMAGE.</p>
  <p>13 EMPHASIZING LUTAN</p>
  <p> His eyes begin to glow as he evaluates what he sees,<br>
    watching with growing interest.</p>
  <p> HAGON<br>
    A force like that cannot possibly<br>
    come from an image, Lutan.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    Then you will show me, Hagon.</p>
  <p> Hagon hesitates, but he has his order. He moves to the<br>
    mat as Tasha steps aside.</p>
  <p>14 ACTION ANGLE</p>
  <p> Hagon crouches, the image crouches. Hagon deftly makes<br>
    two feints, and then a move and is promptly dumped hard.<br>
    There's no doubt about the pain he feels.</p>
  <p> HAGON<br>
    (trying to breathe)<br>
    Oh. . . . Oh...</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    (to Tasha)<br>
    Thank you, Lieutenant. How very<br>
    enlightening.</p>
  <p>15 CLOSER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Behind Tasha the IMAGE RISES and stands, remaining<br>
    quiet.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (into the air)<br>
    Aikido, vanish.</p>
  <p> The IMAGE DISSOLVES. Tasha goes to the panel, shuts<br>
    down the controls, takes a towel from the wall, wipes<br>
    off, and removes her jacket.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - 7/2/87 11.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I could create two -- even three,<br>
    but one is really enough. As you<br>
    fight with it, it learns, and<br>
    before long it knows exactly how<br>
    to defeat you.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    (a smile)<br>
    Even the extraordinary Lieutenant<br>
    Yar?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (also a smile)<br>
    It forces us to keep improving.</p>
  <p> Lutan's eyes are glowing as he nods.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    Your skill impresses me. I like<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> Lutan shows a definite reaction to Tasha, and she<br>
    reacts to him similarly. Picard notices both<br>
    reactions.</p>
  <p>16 INT. CARGO DECK - FULL SHOT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Our Enterprise participants are all present with Lutan<br>
    and Hagon. Good-byes are being exchanged.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Farewell, my new friends of the<br>
    noble Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Understanding has made friends<br>
    of many different people. We've<br>
    had a good beginning, Lutan.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    May I also extend a personal<br>
    farewell to Lieutenant Yar?</p>
  <p> Picard nods. Tasha moves forward. Lutan extends his<br>
    hand to her.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    In your Federation terms.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - 7/2/87 12.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Tasha takes his hand and shakes it. Lutan puts an arm<br>
    around her as if to hug her. Releasing his first hand,<br>
    but still holding her, he reaches up and touches the<br>
    jewel at the center of his necklace. In an instant<br>
    their images SHIMMER, and they are gone.</p>

    Do we know the source of their<br>
    transporter beam?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Our own transporter people tried<br>
    to trace it, sir, but without<br>
    effect.</p>

    important at this time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (touching panel com)<br>
    This is Captain Picard of the<br>
    Enterprise with a message to Lutan<br>
    whom I have so far acknowledged<br>
    as a friend. But you have now<br>
    committed what our laws regard<br>
    as an attack upon us, Lutan. And<br>
    having visited us here, Lutan,<br>
    you must certainly understand the<br>
    power of our vessel. We have so<br>
    far fired only a warning burst<br>
    at you. We insist you reply to<br>
    this message.</p>
  <p> They again wait. Finally Picard turns to Troi:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Opinion, Counselor. Will they<br>
    injure Tasha?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/9/87 15.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I believe not, sir. In fact, they<br>
    seem mainly curious. But in the<br>
    case of Lutan I did feel other<br>
    needs.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What kind of needs?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Some sexual attraction from all<br>
    the males. Lieutenant Yar is<br>
    physically very attractive. But<br>
    I felt something else in the case<br>
    of Lutan... something more like...<br>
    avarice or ambition.</p>
  <p> All puzzle at this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Other comments?</p>
  <p> Data turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If I may, sir... one of the things<br>
    about them in the briefing studies<br>
    was their respect for patience.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Strongly emphasized. And you can<br>
    see it in the precise, ritualistic<br>
    way they do things. I'm worried<br>
    about Lieutenant Yar too, sir,<br>
    but maybe we should sit and wait<br>
    them out.</p>
  <p> Picard considers this, then nods. He turns to Troi and<br>
    Data:</p>

    Yes, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The vaccine...<br>
    (stops; shudders)<br>
    I'm a... physician; I've seen death.<br>
    But not on the scale this could<br>
    mean.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Meanwhile, you were testing<br>
    whether we can replicate the<br>
    vaccine...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And we can't! Their sample<br>
    works fine when used as an<br>
    injection, but it becomes unstable<br>
    when we try to replicate it. You<br>
    must get vaccine from the planet,<br>
    Captain. As much as you can.<br>
    Immediately!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/16/87 17.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm aware of that, Doctor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You've never had to watch a<br>
    patient die from this disease.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's true. But I've seen my<br>
    share of death.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Damn!<br>
    (weak smile; shakes her<br>
    head)<br>
    Where are the calluses we doctors<br>
    are supposed to grow over our<br>
    feelings?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps the good ones never get<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> Beverly moves toward the exit, then stops and turns,<br>

    Yes, Doctor?</p>

    What?<br>
    (recovers)<br>
    Well, yes. Yes, of course.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He's so interested in starship<br>

    interrupting)<br>
    He's on the turbolift. You'll<br>
    remember you ordered him to stay<br>
    off the bridge.</p>
  <p> The whole subject upsets Picard but he feels trapped<br>
    now. And Beverly is remarkably lovely. He finally<br>
    motions for her to follow him toward the bridge.</p>

  <p>23 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS from the Ready Room and CROSSES toward<br>
    his position. Beverly stays half concealed in the<br>
    Ready Room entry. In the b.g. at the turbolift, WE'LL<br>
    SEE Wesley quickly flatten himself almost out of sight.<br>
    But Picard keeps looking in that direction and this<br>
    fact finally forces Wesley SOMEWHAT INTO SIGHT.</p>
  <p>24 ANGLE ON TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Wesley finally comes more fully INTO VIEW and meets<br>
    Picard's eyes.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (weakly)<br>
    I haven't stepped one foot on your<br>
    bridge, Captain...</p>
  <p>25 WIDER ANGLE</p>
  <p> As the other turbolift arrives, from which Riker,<br>
    Data, and Troi ENTER to see Picard in an apparent<br>
    confrontation with Wesley. Riker moves in first,<br>
    speaking rapidly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's all right, sir, I'll see he<br>
    leaves immediately...</p>
  <p> WE SEE Picard throw a fast glance toward the Ready Room<br>
    where Beverly HAS APPEARED in the doorway.</p>

    Doctor Crusher, some of this may<br>
    interest you.</p>
  <p>28 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> to include Beverly STEPPING INTO VIEW, CROSSING to join<br>
    the group at the command position. Except for Troi,<br>
    all feel a moment of discomfort with Beverly appearing<br>
    from the Ready Room and Wesley at the Ops position.</p>

  <p>28 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Proceed with your analysis.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is a highly structured society<br>
    in which people live by strict<br>
    codes of honor. For example, what<br>
    Lutan has done is similar to what<br>
    certain American Indians once did,<br>
    called &quot;counting coup.&quot; That's<br>
    from an obscure language called<br>
    French --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A language which for centuries<br>
    on Earth represented civilization,<br>
    Mister Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Indeed?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I suggest you drop it, Mister<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> A puzzled Data shrugs, goes on.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes sir. Counting coup could be<br>
    as simple as touching an enemy<br>
    with a stick in battle, or taking<br>
    something from him and escaping.<br>
    It was considered extremely<br>
    heroic.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And under these circumstances<br>
    Lutan considers himself heroic,<br>
    risking literally everything in<br>
    the face of our superior power.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And it fits Lutan's personality<br>
    profile as well. He has an<br>
    abnormally high need for<br>
    achievement -- I've sensed it in<br>
    him, very strongly.</p>
  <p> Picard nods.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/9/87 21.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We should establish clearly also,<br>
    that Lutan is dangerous. Self<br>
    image for him is a function of<br>
    how much he THINKS he's achieved.<br>
    Those who set their standards too<br>
    high can kill to meet them.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Why Tasha?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    As a Starfleet security officer,<br>
    she may have represented his<br>
    riskiest prize.</p>
  <p>29 ANGLE EMPHASIZING DATA</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Lutan? What do you wish?</p>
  <p> Lutan is squinting, his screen apparently without<br>
    Picard's image there.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    You will display your image,<br>
    please.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is required is an image of<br>
    Lieutenant Yar, well and...</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Are you making demands, Captain?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/9/87 22.</p>

  <p> She motions; Picard cuts off his transmission.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    According to the Ligon Code of<br>
    Honor, Lutan has done what he set<br>
    out to do -- achieve recognition<br>
    for being daring and bold.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've studied this in some depth<br>
    now, sir. The proper thing for<br>
    you to do now is to ask to get<br>
    Tasha back.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (astonished)<br>
    Ask for her?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Politely, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (touches com button)<br>
    And now, Lutan...<br>
    (swallows irritation)<br>
    You have boldly taken the<br>
    lieutenant from us and I ask that<br>
    you... now please return her.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    Then come visit us, Captain, and<br>
    we will return her to you.</p>

  <p> DATA (O.S.)<br>
    It concerns you directly, Captain.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (O.S.)<br>
    Wesley. It's time we left.</p>
  <p>33 WIDER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE BEVERLY</p>
  <p> moving to the turbolift which she is indicating to<br>
    Wesley. He stands, disappointed that it's over. Picard<br>
    sees this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wesley... thanks for taking a turn<br>
    at the controls.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes sir.</p>
  <p> That has changed everything. A bouyant Wesley leaves<br>
    the bridge with his mother.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    &quot;Commander?&quot; That's quite<br>
    formal...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    So is this request, sir. We<br>
    believe it would be preferable<br>
    if the captain led this away<br>
    party.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Agreed, sir. Their customs<br>
    concerning guests make it much<br>
    preferable.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    And I'm very much against it.<br>
    Lutan is clearly a liar, and<br>
    devious. Counselor Troi has<br>
    admitted she believes him capable<br>
    of killing. It is my duty to keep<br>
    the captain out of danger, sir.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Except that Ligonian custom makes<br>
    it clear that a visiting leader<br>
    becomes an honored guest.<br>
    (indicates)<br>
    Not us, not second in command...<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And the custom requires Lutan to<br>
    die rather than violate that.</p>
  <p> Picard says nothing, waits for Riker to absorb all this.<br>
    Then:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes... it does sound reasonable<br>
    put that way.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I warn you, Captain... if you get<br>
    hurt, I'll put you on report!</p>

    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> This enclosed, sanded area, walled in black, has an<br>
    ascetic, Zen-garden feeling with a pebbled center<br>
    enclosing a small, off-center fountain. A single,<br>
    simple, brilliant banner identifies this an important<br>
    place, and whatever design elements are visible reveal<br>
    an interest in the abstract, perhaps a Mondrian-ish<br>
    feeling. Two sentries are posted beside a doorway.<br>
    Picard and Troi BEAM INTO SHOT. Lutan and Hagon come<br>
    from inside the doorway and exchange the &quot;empty hands&quot;<br>
    ritual greeting with Picard.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    Welcome to my Centerplace, Captain<br>
    Picard. Consider yourselves my<br>
    honored guests.</p>
  <p> YAREENA (O.S.)<br>
    Every hospitality will be accorded<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> ADJUST ANGLE to include YAREENA, who has just joined<br>
    them. She is petite by Ligonian standards and quite<br>
    radiant, a woman of visible nobility and keen<br>
    intelligence. Her only flaw being her passionate,<br>
    unreasoning love for Lutan.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    This is my First One, Yareena.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lutan is a fortunate man.</p>
  <p> She smiles graciously, but remains a bit behind him,<br>
    according to custom.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You've met Counselor Troi.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    Yes.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    As on your vessel, you have only<br>
    to name whatever courtesy we can<br>
    provide.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then, sir... the courtesy of<br>
    seeing Lieutenant Yar.</p>

    (to Picard)<br>
    I find it odd, Captain, that a<br>
    man of your experience has such<br>
    difficulty in understanding<br>
    ordinary politeness.</p>

    The expression &quot;please&quot; is used<br>
    only when requesting the person<br>
    back.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yours is a different world.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    With clear and simple ways deeply<br>
    rooted in our culture. If you<br>
    are willing to ask for Lieutenant<br>
    Yar's release tonight in front<br>
    of all, honor will be satisfied.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    One can see the importance of<br>
    &quot;honor&quot; here.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    Honor is everything.</p>
  <p> Picard and Troi exchange looks.</p>
  <p> HAGON<br>
    There will be gifts for each of<br>
    you, to absolve the abduction.</p>

  <p> Tasha is brought to the doorway between four guards,<br>
    with every sign she would break free at the slightest<br>
    opportunity. One of the guards limps, a leg bandaged.<br>
    When Tasha sees Picard she calms down.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant, have you been treated<br>
    well?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Fine, Captain...<br>
    (indicates bandaged<br>
    guard; smiles)<br>
    ... but they're showing some signs<br>
    of wear.</p>
  <p> YAREENA<br>
    There isn't any need to be<br>
    concerned, Captain. She's being<br>
    well cared for.</p>
  <p> Picard looks Tasha over, then turns to Lutan.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My ship's company and I are<br>
    certain of your gentle wisdom in<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> Lutan hesitates, takes another look at Picard. Then:</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    I thought for a moment I heard<br>
    a threat implied.<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    But that would be foolishness.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Something to be carefully avoided<br>
    I agree.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    The festivities for her return<br>
    to you are in preparation. Shall<br>
    we retire until then?</p>
  <p> Lutan gestures to the guards, who move to take Tasha<br>
    OFF, without resistance. CAMERA PUSHES IN on Picard as<br>
    he replies and considers what is ahead.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Until tonight, Lutan.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - 7/2/87 28.</p>
  <p>35 EXT. CENTERPLACE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Under a canopy, a juggler performs. Guests sit on floor<br>
    mats or cushions. All carry hand-held, delicately<br>
    carved ivory-like sticks which they tap together to<br>
    signal applause or approval. Tables are low and food is<br>
    plentiful. ESTABLISH Lutan and Yareena sitting on a<br>
    slightly raised dais, with Hagon next to him on floor<br>
    level, and Lutan's Supporters close around them. The<br>
    juggler drops something and suddenly stops. He has<br>
    committed an act of dishonor.</p>
  <p>36 ANGLE ON PICARD AND TROI</p>
  <p> Picard and Troi scan the room, hoping to see Tasha. A<br>
    sudden SCREAM from the direction where the juggler had<br>
    performed.</p>
  <p>37 FULL SHOT</p>
  <p> Picard and Troi whirl to look in that direction but<br>
    their line of sight is quickly blocked by gift bearers<br>
    who APPEAR, with Ligonian silks, works of precious<br>
    metal, and fine large gems. Picard is troubled by what<br>
    may have happened to the juggler but is distracted by<br>
    the gift bearers making presentations. Then the room<br>
    falls SILENT.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    We present you gifts!</p>
  <p>38 CLOSER SHOT</p>
  <p> as Tasha is escorted in to approving IVORY-TAPPING<br>
    sounds from the Ligonians who face Lutan. Tasha is<br>
    seated next to Lutan and Yareena on an empty cushion.<br>
    She smiles at Picard and Troi. At FULL SILENCE Lutan<br>
    turns and fixes his gaze on Picard. The moment has<br>
    arrived. Picard rises and faces Lutan with great<br>
    dignity.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lutan, you have granted us<br>
    hospitality and the safety of your<br>
    Centerplace. The gifts you give<br>
    us are rare and precious. We<br>
    thank you. In accordance with<br>
    the customs of your ancestors,<br>
    which I honor and respect, I am<br>
    here in peace to ask for the<br>
    return of Lieutenant Yar.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/9/87 29.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The Guests CHIME WILDLY now, nodding in enthusiastic<br>
    approval. Yareena is especially proud and pleased.<br>
    CAMERA TO LUTAN, who smiles and rises, CAMERA MOVING<br>
    SLOWLY BACK.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    Well spoken. There are some among<br>
    my equals in this gathering who<br>
    were wary of my approaching the<br>
    Federation. I am proud to have<br>
    taken this first step towards a<br>
    treaty -- and proud we have<br>
    something of great value to offer<br>
    you -- a priceless life-giving<br>
    vaccine.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The abduction I have done<br>
    according to our custom, for all<br>
    to see.<br>
    (great applause)<br>
    Your conduct in this matter has<br>
    been beyond exemplary, Captain<br>
    Picard --<br>
    (glances at Tasha)<br>
    -- but now that the moment has<br>
    come, I find I cannot part with<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> A ripple of astonishment flows through the crowd in the<br>
    room. Picard takes a step forward. Tension.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You speak of a code of honor...<br>
    but what you are now saying is<br>
    called under our customs... an<br>
    act of war.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    No, no, Captain! You do not<br>
    understand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Correct! I am now beyond<br>
    understanding!</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    This is not an act of war, but<br>
    of love. I want Lieutenant Yar<br>
    to become my First One.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - 7/2/87 30.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> There is general astonishment. Yareena is as shocked<br>
    and outraged as Picard and Troi. Hagon is also<br>
    disturbed. Yareena jumps to her feet.</p>
  <p> YAREENA<br>
    I challenge your right of<br>
    supercedence!</p>
  <p> The Guests in the room are stunned.</p>
  <p> HAGON<br>
    (at Yareena)<br>
    No woman has challenged<br>
    supercedence for over two-hundred<br>
    years!</p>
  <p> YAREENA<br>
    The right is mine -- and I will<br>
    have it!<br>
    (then to Tasha, furious)<br>
    Natasha Yar -- I challenge you!<br>
    A struggle to the death!</p>
  <p> ZOOM IN and PAN to include QUICK REACTION SHOTS from<br>
    Tasha and Troi. Then, ZOOM BACK as Picard jumps to his<br>
    feet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (strongly)<br>
    NO! The challenge is<br>
    unequivocally refused!</p>
  <p> There is a stunned SILENCE. Lutan rises to his feet,<br>
    eyes blazing.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    Then you shall have no treaty --<br>
    no vaccine -- and no Lieutenant<br>
    Yar!</p>

    continuing his log. A FULL CREW is on station.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    unnoticed.</p>
  <p>41 INT. TASHA'S QUARTERS - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Tasha, doing exercises, straightens up as Picard and<br>
    Troi ENTER SHOT. During the following scene Troi does<br>
    nothing except listen intently. A Ligon Guard patrols.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Captain. Deanna.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Did you have any idea, Lieutenant,<br>
    that Lutan would suddenly announce<br>
    he wanted you for his First One?<br>
    What do you know of this?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Nothing, sir.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (as if to herself)<br>
    But it was a thrill. Lutan is<br>
    such... such a basic male image<br>
    and having him say he wants you...</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Yes, of course it made me feel<br>
    good...</p>
  <p> Then she becomes aware that Picard is watching this<br>
    closely. She turns on Troi:</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Troi! I'm your friend and you<br>
    tricked me!</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Only so you'll think about it<br>
    completely and clearly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/9/87 32.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Lieutenant, and most of all<br>
    myself.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

    How simple all this would be<br>
    without the Prime Directive.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    That thought has passed thorugh<br>
    my mind, Counselor.</p>
  <p>42 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON RIKER</p>
  <p> at the command position, looking toward his panel<br>
    communications. The turbolift doors open, Beverly<br>

  <p> The lighting in the room low, Troi trying to nap but<br>
    with Tasha disturbing this.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    I know I could win. Not that I'd<br>
    take her life, of course, but I'd<br>
    be glad to embarrass her. The<br>
    idea of accusing me...</p>
  <p> Interrupted by Picard ENTERING with guards still in<br>
    b.g. Troi is immediately alert at the captain's<br>
    presence.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The plague?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If anything, worse than we heard.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Which means they desperately need<br>
    the vaccine, sir. And I know<br>
    I can win this challenge...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You do not have to prove anything<br>
    here, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But the vaccine is important in<br>
    this case, sir... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor, I would consider you<br>
    the last person to argue for<br>
    Lieutenant Yar to accept that<br>
    challenge.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - 7/2/87 34.</p>
  <p>44 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Betazoid blood is also practical,<br>
    Captain.<br>
    (indicates Tasha)<br>
    The odds are very good she'd<br>
    defeat Lutan's wife easily and<br>
    you would win all the bargaining<br>
    points you need.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    &quot;The odds are... ?&quot;</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    As you have pointed out yourself,<br>
    we are all at risk every day of<br>
    every mission.</p>
  <p> Picard gives her a searching look, glancing at<br>
    Tasha.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll want some explanations from<br>
    Lutan.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But why not let him volunteer<br>
    them, Captain? His needs for<br>
    approval are immense. I'm sure<br>
    if you found something you liked<br>
    about him, he'd be anxious to<br>
    agree with it.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (laughs)<br>
    Yes, he would indeed. He's almost<br>
    crippled with needs, the poor<br>
    handsome dear.</p>
  <p> Picard considers this, then EXITS.</p>
  <p>45 INT. CENTERPLACE BANQUET AREA - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Lutan and Hagon are still in the empty Banquet Hall,<br>
    talking and finishing a drink. Picard ENTERS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I should tell you I do admire the<br>
    hospitality you offer here, Lutan.<br>
    A pity you began by abducting my<br>
    security officer.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/10/87 35.</p>
  <p>45 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    I am in the grip of forces you<br>
    do not understand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (hesitates; nods)<br>
    Some of it I do understand. She<br>
    is a rather lovely female...</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    You surprise me, Captain. What<br>
    do you know of needs and feelings?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nothing.<br>
    (pretends to hesitate;<br>
    smiles)<br>
    Well, almost nothing in my<br>

  <p> HAGON<br>
    (chuckles)<br>
    Aha, I see.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (smiles now)<br>
    But it puzzles me; if you feel that<br>
    way about Tasha, why have you<br>
    challenged her to a fight to the<br>
    death?</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    Not I, Yareena! I am merely a<br>
    spectator.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But you are also a man of great<br>
    importance and wealth.</p>
  <p> HAGON<br>
    Great importance, perhaps...</p>
  <p> Lutan has tried to stop what Hagon has said, but moves<br>
    too slowly. Picard then chuckles.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Aha, I see. Then you too<br>
    understand the proper value of<br>
    women?</p>

  <p> LUTAN<br>
    We understand they are highly<br>
    pleasant things... but after all,<br>
    unimportant, except for the land<br>
    they own.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're a truly clever person,<br>
    Lutan. You have nothing to lose<br>
    either way the challenge goes.</p>

    them. Picard turns toward the exit with Troi, then<br>
    stops and turns back to Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You're right, Data. It does sound<br>
    like a joke. With the power of<br>
    the Enterprise, we could overwhelm<br>
    this place easily. Take what we<br>
    want.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I may not understand human humor,<br>
    sir, but I am a Starfleet Academy<br>
    graduate.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Which means, of course...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    Directive, sir.</p>

    Which is, unfortunately, what this<br>
    is about. By our standards, the<br>
    customs here and code of honor<br>
    are the same kind of pompous,<br>
    strutting charades that endangered<br>
    our own species a few centuries<br>
    ago. We evolved out of it because<br>
    no one else imposed their own...<br>
    (stops; shakes head<br>
    ruefully)<br>
    Sorry, that became a speech.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're the captain, sir. You're<br>
    entitled...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    I am not entitled to bore you with<br>

  <p> Tasha is alone as Yareena ENTERS.</p>
  <p> YAREENA<br>
    I agreed to this meeting, but I<br>
    see no point to it. You have<br>
    accepted the challenge; there is<br>
    nothing further to say.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    I think you should know that there<br>
    is no physical training anywhere<br>
    that matches Starfleet, especially<br>
    its security people.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/7/87 43.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> YAREENA<br>
    And you should know that even<br>
    though these contests are rare,<br>
    we have a tradition of making<br>
    ourselves capable of them.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Yareena, my acceptance had nothing<br>
    to do with Lutan.</p>
  <p> YAREENA<br>
    It has everything to do with<br>
    Lutan. Lutan wants you to be his<br>
    First One.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Impossible, Yareena. I am a career<br>
    Starfleet officer...</p>
  <p> YAREENA<br>
    How could you not love him? Every<br>
    woman loves him!</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Yareena, I fight for the<br>
    vaccine... That's the truth.</p>
  <p> YAREENA<br>
    The truth is I will kill you if<br>
    I can. And believe me, I can.<br>
    There is nothing else to say.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    In my world it's a greater honor<br>
    to refuse to ...</p>
  <p> YAREENA<br>

    You are on our world!</p>
  <p> Yareena whirls, EXITS.</p>
  <p>54 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS - NIGHT</p>
  <p> The room is similar to Tasha's, but less elegant and<br>
    much smaller. Picard paces.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, I'm your counselor. You<br>
    brought me with you to Ligon to<br>
    be of help.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/10/87 44.</p>
  <p>54 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then help me, please. What is<br>
    a way out of this?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    With the vaccine?<br>
    (shakes head)<br>
    None. Not under the rules we<br>
    believe in.</p>
  <p> There is a KNOCK. A Guard opens the door to admit Data<br>
    and Geordi.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The weapons in that room are<br>
    surprisingly durable and<br>
    flexible... and deadly.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And light, as if they're made for<br>
    women to use.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Some of them still have traces<br>
    of blood -- and poison.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (reacting)<br>
    Poison?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Alkaloid base. Deadly.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But we found no indication it is<br>
    invariably used, sir. Or ever,<br>
    in contests like this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A theory, Data. What would be<br>
    the best defense against weapons<br>
    like these?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Undiminished attack because of<br>
    the possibility of poison, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What about those lengths of metal<br>
    in the yard outside?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - 7/2/87 45.</p>
  <p>54 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Uncertain, sir. However, joined<br>
    together they would make a<br>
    rectangle or square enclosing one<br>
    hundred twenty-one square meters.<br>
    If put end-to-end vertically,<br>
    they would make a pole forty-four<br>
    meters high, or two of twenty-two<br>
    meters, or...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are welcome, sir.</p>
  <p> A KNOCK on the door. Tasha is ushered in by the guard.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    She won't budge. She loves him<br>
    -- without reservation.<br>
    (to them all)<br>
    And she thinks I love him too.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Most interesting. Do you?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Of course I don't, Data! As Troi<br>
    pointed out to me, I'm attracted<br>
    to him but that is entirely<br>
    different.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    How so?</p>
  <p> Picard is becoming amused at this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll agree it is puzzling, Data,<br>
    but since it involves Tasha's very<br>
    intimate and personal...</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    It involves nothing I'm ashamed<br>
    of!<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    In fact, you may discover that<br>
    the very worst move of your life<br>
    was when you threw in with flesh<br>
    and blood humans.</p>

  <p>54 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (nodding gravely)<br>
    But certainly the most<br>
    interesting.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Interesting? Data, I grew up on<br>
    a failed colony, completely<br>
    lawless, mad, where people took<br>
    what they wanted. This meant<br>
    males for the reason they're<br>
    bigger, stronger...<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    And that's why I chose Starfleet<br>
    security, I guess.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (nods)<br>
    For reasons you should be very<br>
    proud of.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Those were my early interests...<br>
    strength, daring, dominant<br>
    males... and that's why Lutan<br>
    attracts me. To me, he's like<br>
    a Federation Olympic Games hero.<br>
    But do I want to become his<br>
    so-called &quot;First One,&quot; marry him?<br>
    That would be nonsense!</p>
  <p>55 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD</p>
  <p> A pause, then Picard draws himself up into a pose<br>
    resembling Data, and:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Most interesting.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (turning, nodding)<br>
    Ah! You feel that also!</p>
  <p> Smiles from all present. Picard now turns to Tasha,<br>
    very serious.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And having laid all that out,<br>
    Lieut...<br>
    (corrects self)<br>
    Tasha... we come to a most serious<br>
    question...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/8/87 47.</p>
  <p>55 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Riker to captain.</p>
  <p> Picard touches his insignia.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go ahead. We're alone.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    We're fine tuned enough to see<br>
    your hosts gathering in the open<br>
    area outside with a number of them<br>
    now headed for your location.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you, Number One.<br>
    (turning to Tasha)<br>
    I was about to ask if considering<br>
    that background, your apprehension<br>
    by Lutan, all of that... do you<br>
    still feel ready to undergo this<br>
    challenge? Do you judge your<br>
    condition good?</p>
  <p> From the door a LOUD KNOCK.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    I judge it excellent, sir.</p>
  <p> Another KNOCK, insistent. Picard nods to Geordi who<br>
    opens the door. It REVEALS Hagon with TWO GUARDS who<br>
    carry two lacquered boxes each. The four boxes (the<br>
    SIZE OF HAT-BOXES) are labeled one through four by<br>
    ornate dot patterns. The boxes are placed on a low table.</p>
  <p> HAGON<br>
    Your weapons, Lieutenant Yar.<br>
    You may pick your size.</p>
  <p> They EXIT. Tasha goes slowly to the boxes, and opens<br>
    first one and then the others. She picks one glavin up<br>
    and holds it for the others to see. They look at it<br>
    with awe. It is a gauntlet-length oversized glove, the<br>
    bulbous and almost basketball size. On the inside of<br>
    the wrist a down-curved claw projects. Out of the glove<br>
    itself stick a profusion of slender eight-inch long<br>
    needles, as if from a porcupine. A thin transparent<br>
    shield covers them. Tasha removes the cover.</p>
  <p>56 CLOSE SHOT - THE GLAVIN IN TASHA'S HANDS</p>
  <p> revealing the above details, but without any poison<br>
    demarcation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/9/87 48.</p>

  <p> GEORDI (V.O.)<br>
    Don't touch the spines! They're<br>
    poisoned.</p>
  <p>57 OMITTED</p>
  <p>58 BACK TO SHOT</p>
  <p> Tasha looks at the glavin carefully, hefts it, touches<br>
    it, estimating it. Geordi comes over and looks at it<br>
    with her.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If you're not careful you could<br>
    kill yourself.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (looks at spines; shakes<br>
    head)<br>
    These I understand.</p>
  <p> From outside, they HEAR a metallic CLANGING. They stop,<br>
    and go to the window.</p>
  <p>59 THEIR POV OUTSIDE - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Outside, in the CENTERPLACE, the sharpened lengths of<br>
    steel have been vertically attached within a multi-level<br>
    rectangle. A number of these poles have horizontal<br>
    segments connecting them. Yareena, wearing workout<br>
    clothing, is maneuvering quickly from level to level,<br>
    carefully avoiding the sharpened spikes. She wears the<br>
    glavin on her left hand only, and uses the claw to give<br>
    her leverage while swinging over and under the<br>
    horizontal bars. It's obvious, as she climbs and jabs<br>
    and slashes out, that she's very good at this. She<br>
    never makes a mistake; the projecting needles never<br>
    touch a pole, and she never makes a misstep. Below her,<br>
    eight metallic objects outline the boundary of the<br>
    arena. Between each of these, perhaps twenty inches off<br>
    the ground, a brilliant green LIGHT BEAM defines the<br>
    outer limit of the rectangle. As a workman puts the<br>
    finishing touches on this apparatus, four additional<br>
    green LIGHT BEAMS suddenly appear, emanating straight<br>
    upward, from the four corners of the centermost section.<br>
    To check them, he interrupts one of the beams with a<br>
    stick of wood. It SIZZLES and begins to BURN.</p>

  <p>62 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ESTABLISHING, THEN PANNING RIKER</p>
  <p> during which, he leaves his command position, CROSSES<br>

  <p> Reaching the turbolift, Riker discovers Wesley standing<br>
    half out of sight inside -- off the bridge. He stops;<br>
    they eye each other. Then, gesturing:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Care to lend a hand?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes sir!</p>
  <p> He bounds onto the Bridge as Riker EXITS by Turbolift.</p>

    They've got eyes only for the<br>

  <p> Riker ENTERS, Data nods at him. Then he includes<br>
    Transporter Chief, saying:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain Picard wanted no risk of<br>
    our communications being<br>
    overheard. You're to proceed now,<br>
    as he indicated.</p>
  <p> Beverly Crusher ENTERS over the last of this. She<br>
    carries a medical tricorder and a couple of instruments<br>
    including a contact hypo. She indicates these to Riker.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain's orders here, too.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Does the Captain understand what<br>
    you and Geordi reported about<br>
    those weapons? They're razor<br>
    sharp, split-second lethal...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I am here to brief you on what he<br>
    plans.</p>
  <p>64 INT. CENTERPLACE - NIGHT</p>
  <p> The Centerplace is alive with a gathering group of<br>
    official spectators, who are seating themselves around<br>
    Lutan and Hagon. Picard, Troi, Geordi, followed by<br>
    Tasha and a guard, ENTER SHOT. Tasha wears the<br>
    glavin with its protective covering. We begin to HEAR<br>
    A RATTLE of ivory-like sticks from the Spectators.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Any last minute instructions, sir?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/10/87 51.</p>
  <p>64 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods; then)<br>
    Stay alive. We'll hope to do the<br>
    rest.</p>
  <p>65 ANGLE TO INCLUDE YAREENA</p>
  <p> as she ENTERS with a Female Aide. LOUDER LIGONIAN<br>
    RATTLING. A Guard motions Yareena and Tasha into the<br>
    combat area. A worker prepares to activate the<br>
    light-beam boundary. When it's quiet, Hagon rises<br>
    and addresses the gathering.</p>
  <p> HAGON<br>
    I speak for Lutan. The rules are<br>
    known; let combat continue until<br>
    there is a victor. It will not<br>
    be interrupted.<br>
    (looks at combatants)<br>
    Proceed.</p>
  <p> Again a RATTLING OF STICKS as Tasha and Yareena ENTER<br>
    the structure at opposite sides. The worker ACTIVATES<br>
    the LIGHT-BEAM boundary. Then SILENCE from the<br>
    Spectators as Tasha and Yareena immediately begin<br>
    working their way through the structure.</p>
  <p>66 CLOSER ON THE COMBAT - NIGHT - (INTERCUT WITH<br>
    SPECTATOR REACTION)</p>
  <p> Tasha goes quickly for the center to defend from there,<br>
    not sure exactly what to expect. Yareena, very sure of<br>
    herself, climbs with agility. The glavin never gets too<br>
    near her body. The glavins CLANG as each of the women<br>
    climbs.</p>
  <p>67 CLOSE ON YAREENA</p>
  <p> Her eyes bright, her expression cold. She appears to<br>
    always figure at least one move ahead.</p>
  <p>68 CLOSE ON TASHA</p>
  <p> learning as she goes. She makes her moves without<br>
    flare, steadily and carefully feeling her way. At the<br>
    moment, it looks as if she's no match for Yareena.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/9/87 52.</p>
  <p>69 ON THEM BOTH - COMBAT SQUARE ONLY</p>
  <p> Yareena suddenly speeds up, agily climbing higher than<br>
    Tasha. Gracefully, she also circles to get behind her.<br>
    Tasha turns barely quickly enough to defend herself.<br>
    Stopping, darting away, and coming from unexpected<br>
    angles, Yareena forces Tasha to change position. Tasha<br>
    at first clambers horizontally, then, aware of what's<br>
    happening, climbs higher to get away from her, but can't<br>
    do it without turning her back.</p>
  <p> Yareena jabs out at her, managing to drive and corner<br>
    her on the highest level of the arena. Again she jabs<br>
    with her glavin, just missing. There's a GASP from the<br>
    audience. Yareena inches closer, leaning out and<br>
    continuing to jab.</p>
  <p>70 ANGLE ON LUTAN</p>
  <p> Not at all as unconcerned as he indicates to Picard.</p>
  <p>71 CLOSE ON TASHA</p>
  <p> Tasha folds her arms and dives beneath the horizontal<br>
    pole, landing on her feet -- but loses her balance, and<br>
    falls within the innermost section.</p>
  <p>72 BACK TO SHOT</p>
  <p> Instantly, Yareena climbs toward her for the kill. As<br>
    she raises her glavin to strike the final blow, her arm<br>
    extends too far back, causing a metallic section of the<br>
    glavin to brush against one of the brightly glowing<br>
    vertical LIGHT BEAMS. This results in a shower of<br>
    SPARKS and a reactive force so strong that it throws<br>
    Yareena's arm forward with such speed that the glavin<br>
    is hurled out of the arena and into the first row of<br>
    spectators.</p>
  <p>73 ANGLE ON LUTAN</p>
  <p> Lutan rises, shouting.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    Combatants, hold your positions!<br>
    (he turns to a guard)<br>
    Return the weapon!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/9/87 53.</p>
  <p>73 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Yareena and Tasha remain stationary as a smiling<br>
    spectator, into whose lap the glavin has fallen,<br>
    gingerly hands it to the guard. His smile quickly turns<br>
    to a grimace of horror as he notices a thin line of<br>
    blood on his thigh. His face contorts as the poison<br>
    instantly takes effect. As the glavin is carefully<br>
    returned to Yareena, WE SEE two sentries removing the<br>
    spectator's body.</p>
  <p>74 CLOSE ON THEM BOTH</p>
  <p> With Yareena re-armed, Tasha aggressively advances<br>
    toward her.</p>
  <p>75 ANGLE ON HAGON</p>
  <p> Very concerned now.</p>
  <p> HAGON<br>
    Yareena! Careful!</p>
  <p>76 ANGLE ON ARENA</p>
  <p> Tasha moves rapidly to the outside, drawing Yareena up<br>
    to follow her, then simulates losing her balance and<br>
    fake-falls, flailing, toward the ground. She appears to<br>
    be caught on the lower rungs without being able to free<br>
    herself. Yareena drops deftly to her feet alongside<br>
    her, stands over her and is about to shove the deadly<br>
    spines of the glavin into her when Tasha kicks out with<br>
    her foot, catching Yareena's leg. Yareena stumbles.<br>
    Tasha gets to her feet and hurls herself at Yareena,<br>
    getting on top of her. Her claw grazes Yareena's<br>
    shoulder, ripping her garment and causing blood to flow.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - 7/2/87 54.</p>
  <p>77 ANGLE EMPHASIZING YAREENA</p>
  <p> staring in horror at the thin TRAIL of blood. She<br>
    starts slowly to rise up. The spectators gasp, waiting<br>
    for Yareena to die.</p>
  <p>78 ANGLE EMPHASIZING TASHA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as she suddenly throws herself bodily across Yareena<br>
    and both of them begin to SHIMMER -- and then are BEAMED<br>
    AWAY.</p>
  <p>79 FULL SHOT</p>
  <p> The crowd rises to its feet in surprise, then anger and<br>
    SHOUTING. They begin to throw their ivory-like sticks<br>
    toward the arena, then at our Away Party which quickly<br>
    moves to one side, standing close.</p>
  <p>80 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Security -- and Beverly, Data, and Riker -- are waiting<br>
    as the supine bodies of Tasha and Yareena appear on the<br>
    transporter pads.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Move!</p>
  <p> Tasha rises as security people grab Yareena and very<br>
    carefully remove her glavin. She appears to be almost<br>
    dead -- perhaps completely so. Tasha removes her own.<br>
    Beverly moves forward to administer a hypo to Yareena.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    We're too late; she's growing<br>
    cold.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Sorry that clashes with my<br>
    instructions...</p>
  <p> The hypo administered, Beverly begins monitoring Yareena<br>
    on the medical tricorder.</p>
  <p>81 CLOSE ON YAREENA</p>
  <p> Not a pretty angle since she indeed looks dead.</p>
  <p>82 CLOSE ON TASHA</p>
  <p> Horror stricken at what she has done.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - 7/2/87 55.</p>
  <p>82 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    On no, no...</p>
  <p>83 INT. CENTERPLACE - EMPHASIZING PICARD AND LUTAN</p>
  <p> with Troi, Geordi and Hagon looking on. Still angry<br>
    spectators in b.g.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Exactly what do you find unfair,<br>
    Lutan? They fought to the death;<br>
    you saw the final blow; you know<br>
    the effects of your poison...</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    But what of your Lieutenant Yar?<br>
    She is to become my First One now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I certainly won't stop her -- if<br>
    she cares to claim that honor.</p>
  <p> Lutan looks closely at Picard, beginning to realize that<br>
    Tasha may not want to be his First One. Hagon moves<br>
    in, comforting:</p>
  <p> HAGON<br>
    But remember, you now have all<br>
    Yareena's lands and wealth, Lutan.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    (with a wry smile at<br>
    Hagon)<br>
    At least, all has not been lost.</p>
  <p> Over which we have HEARD the COMMUNICATOR SOUND, and<br>
    Picard touches his insignia.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard here.</p>
  <p> This amazes Lutan and Hagon too -- it is the first<br>
    they've known of this communication system.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Since you've fulfilled your<br>
    agreement, Captain, can we now<br>
    beam the vaccine aboard?</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    Ah, yes... of course.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/10/87 56.</p>
  <p>83 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No problem, Number One. Send down<br>
    someone from medical.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    And to complete our business here,<br>
    we are locked onto you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Five to beam up. Energize.</p>
  <p> This startles Lutan and Hagon. They are in the act of<br>
    protesting as the TRANSPORTER EFFECT begins.</p>
  <p>84 EXT. SPACE - ORBITAL ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The starship Enterprise.</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    First Officer's log, Stardate<br>
    41235.6. I am returning the conn<br>
    to Captain Picard...</p>
  <p>85 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - FULL SHOT</p>
  <p> Riker still at Command Center as:</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... as we begin loading the vaccine<br>
    supply aboard. Shortly, we hope<br>
    to signal &quot;mission complete.&quot;</p>
  <p> During which Picard, Lutan, Hagon and Troi ENTER from<br>
    a turbolift. Riker sees them, rises, and indicates in<br>
    the proper direction. Wesley makes himself small in<br>
    the bridge position he occupies.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Welcome back, Captain, and you're<br>
    wanted in the lounge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to his guests)<br>
    This way, gentlemen.</p>
  <p> They MOVE ON as indicated. Troi remains on the<br>
    bridge.</p>
  <p>86 INT. LOUNGE - ANGLE ON SIDE OF DOORS</p>
  <p> as they OPEN, REVEALING Picard with Lutan and<br>
    Hagon who react in surprise at what they see inside.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - 7/2/87 57.</p>
  <p>87 WIDE ANGLE - EMPHASIZING LOUNGE OCCUPANTS</p>
  <p> which are Tasha, Beverly... and Yareena, looking very<br>
    alive. On the table there is the fateful glavin,<br>
    medical tricorder and instruments. Accepting what he<br>
    sees, Lutan reacts angrily.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    She is not dead! There was no<br>
    death combat; you have violated<br>
    our agreement. There will be no<br>
    treaty, no vaccine... !</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The challenge was carried out.<br>
    She died, Lutan.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    There was no challenge! She is<br>
    alive.</p>
  <p> Beverly picks up the glavin, moves to Lutan, holding<br>
    it very close to him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I am a physician and saw her die.<br>
    If you doubt this poison, why not<br>
    test it on yourself?</p>
  <p> Lutan has flinched away from it. Picard moves in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lutan, we can provide you with<br>
    the medical records to prove her<br>
    death and how Doctor Crusher<br>
    brought her back.</p>
  <p> Yareena is enjoying this as she makes eye contact with<br>
    Tasha who nods approvingly.</p>
  <p> YAREENA<br>
    And at the instant of death,<br>
    Lutan, a mating agreement<br>
    dissolves.</p>
  <p> Yareena moves toward Lutan.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    But this is witchcraft, Yareena.<br>
    To discard a mate in that<br>
    manner...</p>
  <p> YAREENA<br>
    ... is less painful than the one<br>
    you selected for me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - REV. 7/10/87 58.</p>
  <p>87 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She reaches out and takes the ornate red-stone necklace<br>
    from his neck.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    No, Yareena...</p>
  <p> But he stands unresistingly as she turns with it, faces<br>
    Hagon.</p>
  <p> YAREENA<br>
    Even as I battled, Hagon, I heard<br>
    you calling out for me.</p>
  <p> She raises the necklace. Hagon nods.</p>
  <p> HAGON<br>
    Be my First One, Yareena.</p>
  <p> She places it around his neck.</p>
  <p> YAREENA<br>
    All my land, all my goods, all<br>
    I have... is yours to rule.</p>
  <p> A low SOB from Tasha, drawing startled looks from Picard.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    That's so beautiful.<br>
    (to Lutan)<br>
    And so sad for you. You've lost<br>
    everything.</p>
  <p> LUTAN<br>
    I have my honor.</p>
  <p> And it is true that Lutan still has his head held<br>
    proudly high. Tasha looks at him, then to Yareena.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    It's such a... a waste!</p>
  <p> YAREENA<br>
    Do you want him?</p>
  <p> Tasha is startled, looks to the Captain, then back.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    No, there would be...<br>
    complications.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - 7/2/87 59.</p>
  <p>87 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> YAREENA<br>
    (to Lutan)<br>
    Then I will have you as my Number<br>
    Two.<br>
    (indicates)<br>
    Take your place accordingly.</p>
  <p> Lutan moves to stand slightly behind Hagon.</p>
  <p> HAGON<br>
    As you see, Captain, you may excel<br>
    in technology... but not in<br>
    civilized behavior.</p>
  <p>88 EXT. SPACE - THE U.S.S. ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> still in orbit of Ligon II.</p>
  <p>89 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Fully manned... in fact, too fully. Picard ENTERS,<br>
    then senses something awry. He looks around, puzzled at<br>
    this. Then he looks toward the Ops station where<br>
    Wesley has been hoping to pass unnoticed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What the... !<br>
    (starts again)<br>
    Ah yes, Wesley.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (overlap)<br>
    Wesley!<br>
    (quickly to Picard)<br>
    He'd been manning that station<br>
    for me. I forgot.</p>
  <p> Wesley has come up out of the seat, looking apprehensive<br>
    as he stands somewhat at attention.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well!<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Thank you again for manning one<br>
    of our bridge stations. We'll<br>
    see you get another chance.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes sir!</p>
  <p> Again, those words are an elixir which sends Wesley<br>
    happily on his way.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Code of Honor&quot; - 7/2/87 60.</p>
  <p>89 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's the delay, Number One?<br>
    Why aren't we warping out of here?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Set course for Styris IV, Warp<br>
    three.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Course laid in for Styris IV, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Engage!</p>
  <p>90 EXT. SPACE - THE U.S.S. ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> moving off from Ligon II, then WARP SPEED OPTICAL.</p>
