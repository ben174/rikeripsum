  <p> STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION <br>
    Hide And &quot;Q&quot; </p>
  <p> TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. ENTERPRISE IN SPACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The great ship streaks through space at warp speed.</p>
  <p>2 INT. ND CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Two crewmembers, their arms loaded with supplies, race<br>
    along the corridor. They pass DOCTOR CRUSHER in the<br>
    corridor.</p>
  <p>3 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Beverly checks her Staff as they pass with emergency<br>
    medical packets on way to turbolift.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Include a burn unit with each<br>
    kit. On arrival, identify the<br>
    most critically injured and<br>
    beam them up to Cargo Bay Six...</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Doctor Crusher, this is the<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (touching wall panel)<br>
    Doctor Crusher here.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Additional information. The<br>
    number of colonists at the site<br>
    is five hundred-four - including<br>
    thirty-eight children.</p>
  <p>4 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD is in his Command chair, TROI to his left. WORF<br>
    at the Aft Station. GEORDI has the Conn, DATA on Ops.<br>
    TASHA at Tactical.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: Hide And &quot;Q&quot; - 9/25/87 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The tension level is very high. The mission is urgent.<br>
    As Picard answers, RIKER ENTERS from the turbolift,<br>
    CROSSES the bridge and takes his position.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So far nothing more than the<br>
    initial message. Explosion -<br>
    cause unknown - many injured.<br>
    Are you prepared, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    We believe so, sir.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, we are now at warp nine<br>
    point one.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Which will bring us into the<br>
    Quadra Sigma System in three<br>
    point two hours.</p>
  <p> Riker takes his position.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, I have a schematic of<br>
    the explosion site. It suggests<br>
    the cause as a methane-like gas<br>
    seeping in underground...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (with alarm)<br>
    Captain, I am...</p>
  <p>5 ANGLE ON TROI</p>
  <p> Her face is full of apprehension.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I am sensing what we encountered<br>
    months ago...</p>
  <p> Interrupted by the SOUND of the BRIDGE ALARM.</p>
  <p>6 ANGLE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> He turns. KLAXON HONKING - LIGHTS FLASHING.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: Hide And &quot;Q&quot; - 9/25/87 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>7 ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER - PICARD'S POV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Main Viewer SHIMMERS as an unusual SHINING,<br>
    SPARKLING GRID SHAPE APPEARS, seeming to stretch across<br>
    the whole of the galaxy ahead of them.</p>
  <p>8 ANGLE ON PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> He recognizes the shape - he has seen it before en<br>
    route to Farpoint Station.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The &quot;Q&quot; Entity, sir? It is<br>
    identical to the grid we<br>
    encountered when...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It reads solid, sir. If we hit<br>
    it... !</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not now, damn it, &quot;Q&quot;...<br>
    (to Helm)<br>
    Emergency full stop!</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Shields and deflectors, up, sir.</p>
  <p> The familiar SHIMMERING GRID on the viewer is now very<br>
    close to the Enterprise. Forward movement stops.</p>
  <p>8A EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE IN FRONT OF GRID (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p>8B INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Now reading full stop, sir.</p>
  <p> The words overlapped by something akin to ROLLING<br>
    THUNDER, accompanied by a BRILLIANT and SUSTAINED FLASH<br>
    which becomes RAPIDLY ROTATING, BLINDINGLY BRILLIANT,<br>
    DIAMOND-BLUE LIGHT. While there is no hard-edged<br>
    Shape, it is of about the same volume of a very large<br>
    man.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: Hide And &quot;Q&quot; - 9/25/87 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>8B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (V.O.)<br>
    (amplified and powerful)<br>
    Humans, I thought by now you<br>
    would have scampered back to your<br>
    own little star system.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (waits, then)<br>
    If this is &quot;Q&quot; I'm addressing,<br>
    our vessel and crew are on a<br>
    mission of rescue where a group<br>
    of badly injured...</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (V.O.)<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    We of the &quot;Q&quot; have studied our<br>
    recent contact with you... and<br>
    are impressed. We have much to<br>
    discuss, including perhaps the<br>
    realization of your most<br>
    impossible dreams.</p>
  <p> The expressions of the bridge crew reveal they are<br>
    intrigued by this statement... and in the potential<br>
    of the &quot;Q&quot; entity to do remarkable things, however<br>
    annoying its actions in the past. Even Picard takes<br>
    a moment to absorb this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (sarcastically)<br>
    However intriguing we may find<br>
    that to be, we are now in the<br>
    midst of an urgent journey. Once<br>
    we have completed that...</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (V.O.)<br>
    (louder; angrier)<br>
    You will abandon that mission,<br>
    Captain. My business with you<br>
    takes precedence!</p>
  <p>9 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON BRIDGE CREW</p>
  <p> Reflections of the BRILLIANT DIAMOND-BLUE LIGHT on<br>
    their faces as they look ahead toward this newest Shape<br>
    of &quot;Q&quot;. They shield their eyes from it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: Hide And &quot;Q&quot; - 9/25/87 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>9 (CONTINUED:)</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (V.O.)<br>
    If my magnificence blinds you,<br>
    then perhaps something more<br>
    familiar...</p>
  <p> An explosion of sudden HISSING SOUNDS startles the<br>
    bridge crew into expressions of mixed surprise, fear<br>
    and loathing.</p>
  <p>10 OMITTED</p>
  <p>11 ANGLE ON &quot;Q&quot; SERPENT</p>
  <p> A WRITHING SNAKE with snapping fangs, continuing mixed<br>
    HISSING, DARTS toward them from whence came the &quot;Q&quot;<br>
    light image.</p>
  <p>12 REVERSE ANGLE</p>
  <p> Both Worf and Tasha vaulting down onto the Command<br>
    deck, instinctively drawing phasers as they try to<br>
    position their own bodies between the frightening<br>
    Snake-thing and the bridge Crew, as we:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: Hide And &quot;Q&quot; - 9/25/87 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>13 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON TASHA AND WORF</p>
  <p> First one, then the other, discover phasers<br>
    inoperative. The snake head seems an instant away from<br>
    fanging them...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Damn, the phasers are useless!</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    &quot;Q&quot;, STOP THIS!</p>
  <p>14 EMPHASIZING PICARD AND RIKER</p>
  <p> on their feet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stop this and we agree to talk<br>
    for a moment!</p>
  <p> At which WE SEE the reflection of a familiar BRILLIANT<br>
    LIGHT FLASH, blinding Picard and Riker again. Then<br>
    as they lower their protecting hands, they REACT at<br>
    the sight of:</p>
  <p>15 ANGLE EMPHASIZING &quot;Q&quot;</p>
  <p> in the full-dress uniform of a Starfleet ADMIRAL.</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (ADMIRAL)<br>
    Starfleet Admiral &quot;Q&quot; at your<br>
    service!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are not a Starfleet admiral,<br>
    &quot;Q&quot;...</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (ADMIRAL)<br>
    Neither am I an Aldebaran serpent,<br>
    Captain. But you accepted me as<br>
    such.</p>
  <p> Riker nods, a hint of the irony of this on his<br>
    features.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: Hide And &quot;Q&quot; - 9/25/87 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He's got us there, Captain.</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (ADMIRAL)<br>
    (nods)<br>
    The redoubtable Commander Riker<br>
    whom I noticed before. You seem<br>
    to find this amusing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I might, if we weren't trying<br>
    to rescue a group of suffering<br>
    and dying humans who...</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (ADMIRAL)<br>
    Your species is always suffering<br>
    and dying...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    No, Lieutenant Worf... !</p>
  <p>16 ANGLE TO INCLUDE WORF</p>
  <p> trying to ease himself into a clear line of fire<br>
    toward &quot;Q&quot;. He freezes at Picard's order, eases his<br>
    almost hidden small phaser back into his belt.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You'll make no move against him<br>
    unless I order it.</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; smiles toward Worf.</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (ADMIRAL)<br>
    Pity. You might have learned<br>
    an interesting lesson. Tsk, a<br>
    macro head, a micro brain.</p>
  <p> Worf is obviously unrepentant. Picard, thinking<br>
    furiously, tries another direction.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    &quot;Q&quot;, you said you had the<br>
    realization of &quot;some impossible<br>
    dreams&quot; to offer us. Once this<br>
    rescue is complete, I'll listen<br>
    seriously to whatever proposal<br>
    you wish to make and then, subject<br>
    to it being acceptable...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: Hide And &quot;Q&quot; - 9/25/87 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; bursts into what sounds like genuine LAUGHTER.</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (ADMIRAL)<br>
    &quot;... subject to&quot; your foolish<br>
    human values? Picard, why do<br>
    you people distrust me so?</p>
  <p> Picard starts to open his mouth, shuts it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, if...</p>
  <p> Picard shakes his head, forcing Data into silence...<br>
    also clearly including the rest of his bridge crew in<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (ADMIRAL)<br>
    Yes, Captain, it is best they<br>
    don't answer that. But you... you,<br>
    Picard, I grant the freedom to<br>
    answer me honestly. Why do you<br>
    distrust me so?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    &quot;Q&quot;, right now humans may be<br>
    dying because you...</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (ADMIRAL)<br>
    (angry now)<br>
    SPEAK! Why do you distrust me?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Why? On our first meeting, &quot;Q&quot;,<br>
    you seized my vessel, condemned<br>
    all humans as savages and on that<br>
    charge, you tried us in a<br>
    post-atomic twenty-first century<br>
    court of horrors where you<br>
    attacked my people... then you<br>
    again seized my vessel...</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (ADMIRAL)<br>
    How that angers you: &quot;Seized my<br>
    vessel, seized my vessel... &quot;</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: Hide And &quot;Q&quot; - 9/25/87 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (without pause, ignoring<br>
    this)<br>
    ... and then proceeded to interfere<br>
    with our Farpoint mission,<br>
    threatening to convict us as<br>
    ignorant savages if, in dealing<br>
    with complex and powerful<br>
    life-forms, we made the slightest<br>
    error... and when you failed even<br>
    there...</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (ADMIRAL)<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    At that point, the &quot;Q&quot; became<br>
    interested in you.<br>
    (turns to include bridge<br>
    crew)<br>
    Cannot some of you understand your<br>
    incredible good fortune?!<br>
    (to Picard, mimicking)<br>
    &quot;Seized my vessel, seized my<br>
    vessel... &quot; The complaint of a<br>
    closed mind too accustomed to<br>
    military privileges.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    But you, Riker, and I remember<br>
    you well, what do you make of my<br>
    offer?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I stand with my Captain.</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (ADMIRAL)<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Of course, you do. Commendable<br>
    loyalty.<br>
    (indicating bridge crew;<br>
    to Riker)<br>
    And what of these others? Since<br>
    humanity now interests us, how<br>
    shall we come to know them better?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We don't have time for these<br>
    games.</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (ADMIRAL)<br>
    Ah, yes! A game... for interest's<br>
    sake, a deadly game. To the game!</p>
  <p> And, at a wave of &quot;Q&quot;'s hand, the entire bridge crew<br>
    except for Picard... DISAPPEARS, leaving Picard alone<br>
    on the bridge.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: Hide And &quot;Q&quot; - 9/25/87 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>17 EXT. PLANET PLAIN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The bridge crew are standing in approximately their<br>
    previous bridge positions on a treeless planet plain.<br>
    They have just been snatched from their ship, their<br>
    captain and they are understandably confused and<br>
    uncertain except for Tasha and Worf whose security<br>
    orientation have them immediately combat ready. This<br>
    place is bright, hot.</p>
  <p>18 EMPHASIZING RIKER</p>
  <p> looking up.</p>
  <p>19 RIKER POV - TWIN SUNS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> close together (avoiding the necessity of<br>
    twin-shadows), apparently rotating about each other.<br>
    Both suns are brilliant but the smaller sun, about<br>
    one-quarter the size of the larger, is not quite as<br>
    brilliant as the large one.</p>
  <p>20 BACK TO EXT. PLAIN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi, looking up too, move in next to Riker.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Obviously a Class-M world, gravity<br>
    and oxygen within our limits...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    ... but a twin sun? Where are<br>
    we?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Considering the power<br>
    demonstrated by &quot;Q&quot; the last<br>
    time... Anywhere! Assuming this<br>
    place even exists.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But this won't be boring. If<br>
    &quot;Q&quot;'s anything, he's imaginative.<br>
    (to the others)<br>
    Apparently the captain wasn't<br>
    meant to be with us here.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (overlapping)<br>
    Sir! Over here... !</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: Hide And &quot;Q&quot; - 9/25/87 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>21 ANGLE INCLUDING &quot;Q&quot;</p>
  <p> who stands where a rock formation has previously hidden<br>
    him. He is now wearing a French MARSHAL'S uniform,<br>
    circa the Napoleonic Wars. As Riker, very curious,<br>
    moves toward &quot;Q&quot;, CAMERA MOVES AND PANS TO REVEAL also<br>
    a headquarters-type campaign tent of the same era,<br>
    complete with shade canopy and transportable field<br>
    furniture. &quot;Q&quot; indicates two such chairs with a small<br>
    table which holds a pair of tall, cool drinks.</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (MARSHAL)<br>
    Join me, Riker. A good game<br>
    needs rules and planning...</p>
  <p> Riker hesitates.</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (MARSHAL)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Wasn't it your own Hartley who<br>
    said &quot;Nothing reveals humanity<br>
    so well as the games it plays?&quot;<br>
    (smiles; nods)<br>
    Almost right. Actually, you<br>
    reveal yourselves best in how you<br>
    play.</p>
  <p> Data has moved in next to Riker and speaks quietly.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, what he has in mind could<br>
    provide us with vital information.</p>
  <p> Riker nods, moves toward the campaign tent. &quot;Q&quot; sits,<br>
    waves invitingly toward the empty seat. He also picks<br>
    up one of the tall drinks and WE CAN HEAR ICE CLINKING<br>
    in it.</p>
  <p>22 RIKER AND &quot;Q&quot;</p>
  <p> as Riker inspects the remaining drink without sitting<br>
    yet, picks it up and looks a question toward Troi.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (registering surprise)<br>
    What I sense is... pleasure, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker sips the drink, registers surprise too.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    a couple of them sip. Worf, however, tilts his glass<br>

    Au contraire! It is the human<br>

    True, I borrowed this from your<br>

    Tasha who stands at her familiar position at security.<br>
    Unusually for Tasha, she is showing some strain over what<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    What... what are you doing here?</p>

  <p>30 EXT. THIRD RIDGE</p>
  <p> Worf -- the trained warrior -- approaches with caution.<br>
    It is indeed a bivouac area. Worf can hear the unseen<br>

    but with fearsome, fanged, unhuman features.</p>
  <p>33 BIVOUAC AREA</p>
  <p> Worf reacts at this. Then he moves as close as he<br>
    dares. Those in the camp appear to be preparing for<br>
    a battle. But where human troops would be yelling,<br>
    these soldiers are GROWLING, SNARLING. Over that, the<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Whichever it is, why try to solve<br>

    you seek? Why these games?</p>

    Carrying ancient powder and ball<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Muskets are appropriate to the<br>
    1790 - 1800 French army uniform.<br>
    (shakes head)<br>
    But it is hardly a &quot;weapon&quot; by our<br>
    standards, sir. A lead ball<br>

  <p>37 SPECIAL EFFECT ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Suspecting some kind of trap, Riker draws his own hand<br>
    phaser. He checks its setting, aims it well away from<br>

  <p>38 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> It also produces another effect -- the FORM of Worf,<br>
    large phaser in hand, propelling itself INTO SCENE,<br>

    Data, if you've got a theory on<br>

    Think fast, Commander Riker.<br>
    (REACTING; pointing)<br>
    And move fast... !</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; is pointing at two of the fierce-looking Animal<br>
    Things in French uniform that have moved INTO SIGHT,<br>
    aiming their &quot;muskets&quot; at Geordi who jumps behind a<br>
    rock. TWO PHASER BLASTS. The first hits a rock near<br>
    Geordi. The second BLASTS A BROAD FURROW in the<br>
    desert floor.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's no &quot;musket!&quot;</p>

  <p> Worf and Troi come INTO VIEW too.</p>
  <p>42 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker becomes aware of someone scrambling toward him.<br>

  <p> The bridge is empty -- the displays and readouts are<br>
    still frozen. The ambient noise is still absent. SLOW<br>
    PUSH IN to Tasha sitting on the bench beside Riker's<br>
    position. Head in hands, she stares at the floor.<br>
    Suddenly the room noise changes and on the SOUND her<br>
    head comes up.</p>

    We never did. &quot;Q&quot; suspended time.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    He was with us.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    He must still be on the planet.<br>

    We were under attack by... by<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Animal things in uniform, sir...<br>
    (quails at Picard's<br>

    Which I think Data could probably<br>
    explain better, sir.</p>
  <p> As Picard turns to Data, the android decides he wants<br>
    no part of this.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You may find it aesthetically<br>
    displeasing, sir. I could just<br>
    file a computer report on that...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Sir, the important thing right<br>
    now is why is Commander Riker<br>
    missing?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Understood, Counselor, but Will<br>
    is almost certainly safe...<br>
    (troubled)<br>
    ... at least &quot;safe&quot; in a physical<br>
    sense. &quot;Q&quot; has an interest in<br>
    him... in fact, &quot;Q&quot;'s entire visit<br>
    has something to do with our<br>
    first officer.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And the reason for that, sir... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I wish I knew. &quot;Q&quot; became<br>

  <p>54 ANGLE AT ROCK FORMATION</p>
  <p> REVEALING Riker who has managed to find himself a<br>
    little shade. He sits, leans back against a rock.<br>
    Then, starts to laugh. It is a deep, satisfying laugh<br>
    from one who has just been let in on a cosmic joke.</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (O.S.)<br>
    Something amuses you?</p>
  <p> Riker looks up.</p>
  <p>55 ANGLE UP ON &quot;Q&quot; - RIKER'S POV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Standing on a ledge above Riker, heavily back-lit by<br>
    the two suns. (If possible, formed here by two<br>
    brightly illuminated OUT-OF-FOCUS balls as described<br>
    earlier.) We'll see more clearly in a moment also that<br>
    &quot;Q&quot; wears rank and uniform identical to Riker's.</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (COMMANDER)<br>
    Perhaps you would share the joke<br>
    with me?</p>
  <p>56 ANGLE ON RIKER</p>
  <p> as &quot;Q&quot; moves down into TWO SHOT. Riker eyes &quot;Q&quot; for<br>
    a long beat, then:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The joke is you, you silly son<br>
    of a bitch.</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; glares at Riker who now seems confident and at ease<br>
    about something.</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (COMMANDER)<br>
    Strange gratitude from one who<br>
    has been granted a gift beyond<br>
    any human dream. How can you not<br>
    appreciate being able to send your<br>
    friends back to their ship...<br>
    (the sweeping gesture)<br>
    ... or sending the soldiers back to<br>
    the &quot;nothingness&quot; from which they<br>
    came?</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; takes a beat, sits on a piece of rock next to<br>
    Riker, leans toward him confidentially.</p>

    Certainly, you understand that<br>
    at this moment you can send<br>
    yourself back to your ship... or<br>
    to Earth, or change your shape<br>
    and become anything else you<br>
    want to be...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    What do you need, &quot;Q&quot;?</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (COMMANDER)<br>
    &quot;Need?&quot;</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You want something from us, &quot;Q&quot;.<br>
    Desperately! What is it?</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (COMMANDER)<br>
    Want something from you foolish,<br>
    fragile, non-entities? Careful,<br>
    Riker, you're beginning to sound<br>
    like your captain.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (grins)<br>
    Now that's a compliment, &quot;Q&quot;.<br>
    But it's not an answer.</p>
  <p> Stung by this, &quot;Q&quot; comes to his feet, raising a hand<br>
    as if to make the gesture we've seen before... finds<br>
    Riker still smiling up at him. He turns, walks angrily<br>
    a few steps away, then a few back as if bringing his<br>
    anger under control.</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (COMMANDER)<br>

    After Farpoint, I returned to<br>
    where we exist... the &quot;Q<br>
    Continuum.&quot;</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Which means exactly what?</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (COMMANDER)<br>
    (trace of annoyance)<br>
    The limitless dimensions of the<br>
    galaxy in which we exist. We<br>
    could hardly be capable of acting<br>
    in ways that seem so astonishing<br>
    to you... if we were limited to<br>
    the primitive dimensions in which<br>
    you live, dimensions which would<br>
    make us prisoners of time and<br>
    space.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    I don't understand...</p>

    (leans in again)<br>
    At Farpoint, we saw you as savages<br>
    only, and thought to frighten you<br>
    into scurrying back to your<br>
    system. We discovered instead,<br>
    that you are an unusual creature<br>
    in your own limited ways... ways<br>
    which in time may not be so<br>
    limited.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nods)<br>
    We're growing. Something about<br>
    us compels us to learn,<br>
    explore...</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (COMMANDER)<br>
    (nods)<br>
    The human compulsion. And,<br>
    unfortunately, for us, a force<br>
    that will grow stronger century<br>
    after century, eon after eon...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Eons! Have you any idea how far<br>
    we'll advance?</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (COMMANDER)<br>
    Perhaps in a future you cannot<br>
    yet conceive... even beyond us.<br>
    And so, we must know more about<br>
    the human condition. We have<br>
    selected you, Riker, to become<br>
    part of the &quot;Q&quot;... to bring that<br>
    human need and hunger to us so<br>
    that we may understand it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (ponders, then)<br>
    I... suppose you mean that as a<br>
    compliment, &quot;Q&quot;... or maybe it's<br>
    my limited mind...<br>

  <p> as they ARRIVE at a doorway. The door has been jammed<br>
    by the explosion. Data steps over and with his great<br>
    strength - rips the door off his hinges and clears the<br>
    opening.</p>
  <p> The survivors are here. ABOUT A DOZEN of them, huddled<br>
    together on the far side. Beverly and her teams wade<br>
    through the water to them.</p>

  <p> As she kneels beside an injured WOMAN.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You are going to be all right,<br>

  <p>79 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Beverly rushes over and while Data holds the child,<br>
    she quickly examines him.</p>
  <p>80 ANGLE ON BEVERLY AND CHILD</p>
  <p> From her expression it is clear the child is dead.<br>
    All of her skill will not help.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    She's dead. If we'd only gotten<br>
    here a little sooner... !</p>
  <p>81 ANGLE ON RIKER</p>
  <p> He steps closer. A dead child. A moment of truth.</p>

    Sir, if you indeed have &quot;Q&quot;'s<br>

    Riker CROSSES to Picard. Troi is watching Riker with<br>
    such intensity she doesn't seem to be breathing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    As soon as it's convenient<br>
    Captain, I insist on a meeting<br>
    with you and your staff.</p>
  <p> There is about Riker now a little of the force, the<br>
    power, the arrogance of &quot;Q&quot;. Modified by the man<br>
    himself -- but he is definitely carrying himself with<br>
    more presence.</p>
  <p>89 ANGLE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> It's as though he's been expecting this since the<br>
    incident with &quot;Q&quot;.</p>
  <p>90 ANOTHER ANGLE RIKER AND PICARD</p>
  <p> The others are watching this exchange, curious about<br>
    how Picard will respond.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As soon as we are secure from the<br>
    rescue operation, we'll meet in<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Riker turns, stalks to the turbolift. Troi gives him<br>
    a look of apprehension.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Power -- immense. Frightening.<br>
    I can't read the intent -- but<br>
    there is terrible anger in him.</p>

  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>91 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker is already there, sits brooding. Picard ENTERS<br>
    with Data, Troi, Geordi, Tasha and Worf. As Picard<br>
    seats himself:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll confer on the bridge here<br>
    if no one...</p>
  <p> Without looking in that direction, Riker gestures<br>
    Picard to be silent and, surprised, Picard hesitates<br>
    during which Riker turns toward the others.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The bridge is fine since I've<br>
    called the entire staff...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Correction, Number One; knowing<br>
    the decision you face, I've<br>
    permitted you this gathering.</p>
  <p> Riker seems genuinely amused by Picard's correction,<br>
    as if yielding to a bright but headstrong child. Riker<br>
    nods, uses a gentle tone.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Of course, Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> Riker looks up startled to see Beverly and Wesley ENTER<br>
    bridge from the turbolift.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This meeting isn't for you,<br>
    Wesley!</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Why not, sir? You helped make<br>
    me a bridge officer...<br>
    (corrects self)<br>
    ... an acting ensign.</p>
  <p> Looking from one to the other.</p>

  <p>91 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All right, he stays. The first<br>
    thing he'll hear is... because I've<br>
    been given unusual powers, I'm<br>
    not suddenly a monster. Except<br>
    for those abilities, and I don't<br>
    yet know how far they go... I'm<br>
    the same William T. Riker you've<br>
    always known.</p>
  <p> There's a long silence, no one speaking up.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Well? Everyone still looks<br>
    uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps we're all remembering the<br>
    old saying... &quot;power corrupts... &quot;</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    ... &quot;and absolute power corrupts<br>
    absolutely.&quot; Do you believe I<br>
    haven't thought of that, Jean-Luc?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And have you noticed that you and<br>
    I are now on a first-name basis?</p>
  <p> A flicker of surprise on Riker's features indicates<br>
    he really hasn't.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Will, something has happened to<br>
    you already...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    In what way? Haven't you seen<br>
    how much I've regretted not saving<br>
    that child? Captain, using the<br>
    &quot;Q&quot; power to save her might not<br>
    have been wrong!<br>
    (to bridge crew)<br>
    No more than it was wrong to save<br>
    the rest of you from those soldier<br>
    things.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's keep in mind that particular<br>
    danger was invented by &quot;Q&quot;.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    What we represent to the &quot;Q&quot;,<br>
    Will, are lowly animals, tormented<br>
    into performing for their<br>
    amusement...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Actually, they think highly of<br>
    us, Troi. We have a quality<br>
    of... of growth which they<br>
    admire...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Or fear?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One, we've learned that<br>
    the &quot;Q&quot; power does not admire<br>
    us... &quot;Q&quot; has muddled your mind<br>
    somehow.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's your mind that troubles me,<br>
    Captain. Don't you understand<br>
    his incredible gift to me?</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (BROTHER) (O.S.)<br>
    Are these truly your &quot;friends,&quot;<br>
    Brother?</p>
  <p>92 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> All whirl toward the VOICE. It comes from a far corner<br>
    of the bridge where a Figure stands with its back to<br>
    us. &quot;Q&quot; turns now, revealing himself draped in what<br>
    is recognizable even in this century as the somber<br>
    robes of something like the Franciscan Holy Order --<br>
    and &quot;Q&quot; is playing it to the hilt with gentle voice,<br>
    kindliness shining from his face, fingers pointed<br>
    together as in prayer. He CROSSES IN to stand with<br>
    Riker, head bowed in humility.</p>

    Let us pray for understanding,<br>
    for compassion, for...</p>

    Let us do no such damned thing!<br>

    What is this need of yours for<br>
    costumes? Have you no identity<br>
    of your own?</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (BROTHER)<br>
    (softly; gently)<br>
    I come in search of truth.</p>
  <p> The expression on Riker's face reveals that he is<br>
    growing somewhat uncomfortable with this continuation<br>
    of masquerade.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You come in search of what<br>
    humanity is!</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; has withdrawn a large cross symbol from his robes<br>
    as if warding off Picard's words.</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (BROTHER)<br>
    I forgive your blasphemy...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (indicates &quot;Q&quot; to Riker)<br>
    Can't you see it, Number One?<br>
    He's nothing but a flim-flam man!<br>
    That's what he's been since his<br>
    first appearance at Farpoint!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Flim-flam?</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (BROTHER)<br>

    You offer Riker jealousy! What<br>
    I offer him is clearly beyond your<br>
    comprehension!<br>
    (turning to the others<br>
    one by one)<br>
    How can you claim friendship for<br>
    Riker while obstructing his way<br>
    to the greatest adventure ever<br>
    offered a human?!</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (alerted)<br>
    &quot;Obstruct him?&quot; Then it's not<br>
    yet certain? He's not yet<br>
    committed?</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (BROTHER)<br>
    (quickly, loudly;<br>
    overlapping last line)<br>
    The truly evil part of this is<br>
    your jealousy, Captain.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    You love each one of your people!<br>
    Demonstrate it! You have the<br>
    power to leave each of them with<br>
    a gift proving your affection.</p>
  <p> Riker isn't sure of this. He looks to Picard<br>
    inquiringly, but speaks a bit thickly at times.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There'd be no... harm, would there,<br>
    if I, if I gave them something<br>
    I know they'd like?</p>
  <p> Picard's next few expressions are a study in a change<br>
    of decision. His first instinct is to recommend<br>
    against it... and he almost voices it. But then, Picard<br>
    begins to suspect that this may, in fact, give Riker<br>
    a chance to understand the human effect of near-godlike<br>
    power.</p>
  <p> &quot;Q&quot; (BROTHER)<br>
    How touching. A plea to his<br>
    former captain.<br>
    (watching Picard)<br>
    &quot;May I please give some happiness<br>
    to my friends, sir? Please sir?&quot;</p>

    By all means, demonstrate your<br>

  <p> Troi is clearly still nervous about this. Data too.</p>

    Remarkable! He rises now above<br>
    jealousy.</p>
  <p>93 ANGLE EMPHASIZING RIKER</p>
  <p> turning to his friends.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Don't be frightened. There is<br>

    you. Shall I guess your dreams?</p>

    Have your favorite wish, my young<br>

    Starfleet officer of about 25 years.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: Hide And &quot;Q&quot; - 9/25/87 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>95 INTERCUT OTHERS</p>
  <p> Their REACTIONS. Their surprise is complete. On a<br>
    very intimate level that concerns themselves, this<br>
    seems godlike power they are witnessing. Picard, on<br>
    the other hand, seems to be analyzing, measuring, what<br>
    is happening.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hey Wes, you've grown into a very<br>
    good looking guy!</p>
  <p> Tasha gives a &quot;definitely&quot; to that sentiment. Troi<br>
    is concerned about Beverly who seems stunned as she<br>
    walks nearer her son, scrutinizing him closely. Data<br>
    gives Picard a puzzled &quot;what are you up to&quot; look.<br>
    Picard appears to be holding his breath as he<br>
    anticipates further developments.</p>

    head)<br>
    No!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's what you've always wanted,<br>
    Data to become human!</p>
  <p> Data almost says &quot;yes,&quot; but then:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir, that is true. But I<br>
    never wanted to compound one<br>
    illusion with another. It might<br>
    seem real to &quot;Q&quot; -- even you,<br>
    sir... but it would not be so to<br>
    me. Was it not one of the<br>
    Captain's favorite authors who<br>
    wrote, &quot;This above all, to thine<br>
    own self be true?&quot;<br>

    Well, my friend, I know what you<br>
    want. Welcome to the wonderful<br>
    world of vision.</p>
  <p> Geordi looks around in awe. His eyes come to rest on<br>
    Tasha.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You're as beautiful as I imagined,<br>
    and more.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then we can throw the VISOR away?</p>
  <p> Geordi slowly replaces the VISOR over his eyes.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I think not, sir. The price is<br>
    a little high for me. I don't<br>
    like who I would have to thank.<br>
    I can still steer the ship with<br>
    this.</p>

  <p>98 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> In a LIGHT FLASH, it's not Worf who changes but someone<br>
    else who APPEARS at his feet -- a Klingon warrioress.<br>
    Her eyes flash as she looks up at her man Worf, an arm<br>
    encircles him at the knees -- her other arm holds a<br>
    Klingon weapon -- a kligat -- as she looks around, sees<br>
    nothing but sliens. Then moving with surprising speed,<br>
    she comes to her feet and lashes out with her weapon<br>
    at Troi, who is the person nearest. Worf moves quickly<br>
    too, takes the blow intended for Troi, SLAMS the<br>
    warrioress down. In Klingon tradition, she flattens<br>
    herself to the floor and crawls, SNARLING to embrace<br>
    Worf's feet.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (whirling to Riker)<br>
    No! She is from a world now alien<br>
    to me. I have no place in my life<br>

    objects...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No, I'd just like to get there<br>
    on my own. Honest!</p>
  <p> Picard is now looking very pleased... both with himself<br>
    for estimating this correctly, and with his people for<br>
    their common sense. Riker sees and understands.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How did you know, sir? I feel<br>
    like such... such an idiot!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Quite right, you should!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But it was... such a pleasure to<br>
    have been able to do those things.</p>

    human to join you. So, &quot;Q&quot;, I<br>
    strongly suspect you have some<br>
    explaining of your own to do...</p>

    the entire SCENE for a moment. Then WE SEE REVEALED<br>
    the bridge crew exactly as we saw them when this ACT<br>
    began. &quot;Q&quot; is no longer there -- Wesley is fifteen<br>
    again -- Worf is without his warrioress -- Tasha is<br>
    the familiar security chief. And all are at their duty<br>
    positions, with Wesley assisting Data at Ops, Beverly<br>
