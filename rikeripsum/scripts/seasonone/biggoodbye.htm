    <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship passes over us slowly, giving a distinct<br>
    impression of its great size...</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    Ship's log, First Officer Riker<br>
    reporting. Stardate 41997.7 We<br>
    are about to make a brief but<br>
    necessary contact with the Jarada,<br>
    a reclusive race known for its<br>
    idiosyncratic attitude towards<br>
    protocol... The Federation has been<br>
    trying unsuccessfully to establish<br>
    a relationship, and now the task<br>
    falls to Captain Picard.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> RIKER sits alone at the Command Area. WESLEY and WORF<br>
    man the Ops and Conn; DATA is at Science One.</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... In two days we will reach the<br>
    area of their planet, known as<br>
    Torona Four. The Jarada demand<br>
    a precise greeting. Their<br>
    language is most unusual...</p>
  <p>3 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - MOVING IN ON PICARD</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... The slightest mispronunciation<br>
    is regarded as an insult.</p>
  <p> PICARD is earnestly studying. WE SEE a text filled<br>
    with Jaradan (HA-RAH-DAN) figures and their English<br>
    equivalents.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Big Good-bye&quot; - 10/14/87 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>4 TWO SHOT TO INCLUDE TROI</p>
  <p> sitting across from him, helping with the dialect.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The double bars indicate an<br>
    elongated &quot;s&quot; sound --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    -- And the inverted &quot;T&quot; means to<br>
    hold the &quot;zee.&quot;</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Unless... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Unless it's followed by three wavy<br>
    lines; in which case the &quot;zee&quot;<br>
    becomes a &quot;bee.&quot;</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Exactly.</p>
  <p> Picard pushes the text aside and wearily rubs his neck.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What a language.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It is an insect mind.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (burnt out)<br>
    My mind's barely working.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Take a break, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (shaking head)<br>
    No. I want to go over it again.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You could be over-preparing.<br>
    You've been looking forward to<br>
    the upgrade of the Holodeck. You<br>
    have the time. You need the<br>
    diversion...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Big Good-bye&quot; - 10/14/87 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>5 ANGLE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> thinking about what Troi's said.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Dixon Hill.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The program's installed and<br>
    waiting.</p>
  <p>6 OMITTED</p>
  <p>7 INT. ENTRANCE TO HOLODECK - ANGLE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> Picard touches the COMPUTER panel on the wall.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Planet and city?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Earth... United States... San<br>
    Francisco, California.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Time period?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (pondering it)<br>
    1941, A.D.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    File or access code.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    File Dixon Hill, private<br>
    detective.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Enter when ready.</p>
  <p> Picard steps through doors.</p>
  <p>8 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT</p>
  <p> ... and comes out in a darkly lit hallway, circa 1941.</p>
  <p> At the end of the hall is a wooden door with a glass<br>
    window. The letters on the pane read &quot;DIXON HILL,<br>
    PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.&quot;</p>
  <p> Picard is pleased. He opens the door...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Big Good-bye&quot; - 10/14/87 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>9 INT. WAITING ROOM/OFFICE - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Hill's SECRETARY, a plain blond with a bubbly<br>
    personality, is just on her way to lunch. She looks<br>
    Picard up and down with bemusement...</p>
  <p> SECRETARY<br>
    Very funny, Dix. What'd you do,<br>
    lose another bet?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't understand --</p>
  <p> SECRETARY<br>
    The bellboy suit. Are you<br>
    moonlighting at the Fremont?</p>
  <p> Picard looks down at his uniform.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The uniform. Totally<br>
    inappropriate. Why didn't I<br>
    change?</p>
  <p> The Secretary hurriedly pulls on her coat and gloves.</p>
  <p> SECRETARY<br>
    Mister Leech called twice, and<br>
    there's a lady named Bradley<br>
    waiting in your office. Nice<br>
    legs.</p>
  <p> In a flash, she's halfway out the door.</p>
  <p> SECRETARY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Gotta hot date with my fella.<br>
    I'll see ya in the morning.</p>
  <p> She gives Picard's uniform one last look -- shaking her<br>
    head as she SHUTS THE DOOR BEHIND HER.</p>
  <p> Picard is left alone in the waiting room. He's<br>
    thrilled by the detail in this, the somewhat rundown<br>
    workplace of the fictional detective DIXON HILL.</p>
  <p> A RUSTLING NOISE in the adjoining room reminds Picard<br>
    that someone's waiting for him.</p>
  <p> As he pushes the door open, the first thing he sees are<br>
    the great pair of legs his secretary mentioned.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Big Good-bye&quot; - 10/14/87 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MRS. JESSICA BRADLEY rises to greet the detective she's<br>
    come to see. She's a wealthy woman in her late<br>
    twenties who radiates a seductive sensuality. The rest<br>
    of her body matches her legs.</p>
  <p> She can't help but wonder at the sight of Picard's<br>
    maroon and black uniform...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Uh, I lost a bet.</p>
  <p> JESSICA<br>
    Oh well... At least you're ready<br>
    for Halloween.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Halloween?</p>
  <p> She BLOWS OUT some cigarette SMOKE and looks out at<br>
    the city, concerned, then turns to him.</p>
  <p> JESSICA<br>
    I need your help, Mister Hill.<br>
    (turning to face him)<br>
    Someone is trying to kill me.</p>
  <p> MUSICAL STING, FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>10 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship smoothly cruises through the starry blackness<br>
    of space. Over this:</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental. I<br>
    am delighted with how the<br>
    Holodeck has created the<br>
    fictional world of Dixon Hill...</p>
  <p>11 INT. DIXON HILL'S OFFICE - ON PICARD</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... the twentieth century<br>
    detective who has been a hero of<br>
    mine since childhood.</p>
  <p>12 WIDER ANGLE TO INCLUDE JESSICA</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The illusion is flawless. The<br>
    computer characters accept me as<br>
    Dixon Hill, even to the extent that<br>
    Jessica Bradley, a millionaire's<br>
    wife from the wrong side of the<br>
    tracks, wants to hire me.</p>
  <p> JESSICA<br>
    I'm not sure who wants me dead.<br>
    My husband... My stepdaughter...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Or a lover, perhaps?</p>
  <p> Mrs. Bradley shoots Picard a sly look.</p>
  <p> JESSICA<br>
    Perhaps.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    Perhaps Cyrus Redblock.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Big Good-bye&quot; - 10/14/87 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She seems to wait for a reaction from Picard, but it<br>
    never comes.</p>
  <p> JESSICA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I need you to find out. Name<br>
    your fee.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Twenty dollars a day. Plus<br>
    expenses.</p>
  <p> JESSICA<br>
    Agreed.</p>
  <p> She gets up, as though preparing to leave...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I haven't said yes yet.</p>
  <p> JESSICA<br>
    (cool smile)<br>
    Oh you'll say yes.</p>
  <p> She moves closer and kisses him tenderly. Picard is<br>
    surprised by the warmth of her lips.</p>
  <p> JESSICA<br>
    (continuing; whispering)<br>
    If it's Redblock, he must think<br>
    I've got what he's looking for.<br>
    But believe me, I don't.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll take your word for it.</p>
  <p> Jessica hands him money. WE SEE a crisp one-hundred<br>
    dollar bill.</p>
  <p> JESSICA<br>
    Here's a C-note in advance.<br>
    Consider it a retainer...<br>
    (day as she touches<br>
    his uniform)<br>
    ... and next time, could you wear<br>
    a suit?</p>
  <p> She takes one of Hill's business cards from his desk<br>
    and then EXITS, as the captain watches her leave the<br>
    office.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Big Good-bye&quot; - 10/14/87 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Now alone, it's clear he's enthralled by this imaginary<br>
    world. He opens the window and looks down on the<br>
    street -- WE CAN HEAR THE SOUNDS OF MOVING TRAFFIC AND<br>
    HONKING HORNS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to himself, soft)<br>
    Remarkable.</p>
  <p> Picard leaves the window. He touches the insignia<br>
    on his chest, and a QUICK HIGH PITCHED SOUND CAN BE<br>
    HEARD through the closet door in his office. (Picard<br>
    knows that this sound indicates another Holodeck<br>
    Exit.)</p>
  <p> He opens the closet door and finds the portal. Just<br>
    before he steps through, there's a knock on the waiting<br>
    room door.</p>
  <p>13 PICARD'S POV - THE DOOR</p>
  <p> The SILHOUETTE of a small man CAN BE SEEN though the<br>
    pane. He knocks again, delicately; his knuckles<br>
    sounding like a woodpecker rapping on a hollow tree.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (calling out)<br>
    You'll have to call again. I'm<br>
    just leaving. I'm not dressed<br>
    properly. I'll be back.</p>
  <p> And he leaves -- WALKING THROUGH the EXIT. The office<br>
    door OPENS. Leech ENTERS. Mister Leech has short<br>
    curly hair and big bulging eyes. He wears a bow tie<br>
    and speaks with a strange nasally tone that betrays<br>
    a Middle-Eastern background.</p>
  <p> LEECH<br>
    Not yet, please --</p>
  <p> Leech looks around at the empty office, confusion on<br>
    his face.</p>
  <p>13A INT. HOLODECK CORRIDOR BY SIDE EXIT</p>
  <p> Picard walks down the corridor and turns the corner<br>
    to the main entrance to the Holodeck.</p>

  <p>20 BACK TO SHOT</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I saw an entire city block from<br>
    that window.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It sounds wonderful.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm going to try it again, only<br>
    this time I'm going to dress the<br>
    part.<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    Why not come with me?</p>
  <p>21 CLOSE ON BEVERLY</p>
  <p> surprised and pleased that she's been asked.</p>
  <p>22 BACK TO SHOT</p>

    historian... the twentieth century<br>
    expert...</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Whalen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Whalen. He probably knows<br>
    more about Dixon Hill than I do.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will tell him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Invite him, Mister Data. This<br>
    is, after all, a leisure activity.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The sense of reality is<br>
    incredible. When that woman<br>
    kissed me, it was so --</p>
  <p> Picard cuts off when he realizes Beverly is staring at<br>
    him. She chooses an adjective and finishes his<br>
    sentence...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Exciting?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Big Good-bye&quot; - 10/14/87 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Real.<br>
    (clears throat)<br>
    The subject of this meeting is<br>
    the Jaradan rendezvous. Proceed<br>
    with the briefing, Number One.</p>
  <p> Riker has been enjoying the discussion, but he quickly<br>
    switches gears.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is primarily a necessary<br>
    diplomatic mission. The Jaradan<br>
    are strategically important to the<br>
    Federation. Previous attempts<br>
    failed because they are so easily<br>
    irritated. A slip in the<br>
    pronunciation of the greeting<br>
    caused a twenty-year rift in the<br>
    relation.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Therefore the captain must recite<br>
    the entire greeting without any<br>
    mistakes.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (amused)<br>
    Simple as that.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (straightforward)<br>
    Yes. If, on the other hand, the<br>
    captain makes even the slightest<br>
    error --</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    -- The captain is well aware of<br>
    the gravity of the situation,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have located a history tape<br>
    of the last Federation starship<br>
    to come in contact with the<br>
    Jarada. It graphically<br>
    demonstrates what happened when<br>
    that captain offended them.</p>

  <p>22 CONTINUED: (2)</p>

    The captain is familiar with that,<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Should we not run it?</p>

    It's not necessary. Meeting<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Why would the captain not want<br>
    to review all the information<br>
    available on the subject?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    When you've seen the Jaradan<br>
    react once, you don't ever have<br>
    to see it again.</p>
  <p> Data shrugs and decides to change the subject.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Dixon Hill is a most puzzling<br>

    I am about to reenter the world<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    I have mastered the lingo of the<br>

    (psuedo-Bogart)<br>
    It was raining in the city of<br>
    Angels -- a hard rain -- almost hard<br>
    enough to wash the slime from the<br>
    streets. But it never does. When<br>
    the rain stops, the boulevard<br>
    dries and the snakes once again<br>
    slink from their holes. That's<br>
    when my door opens and the<br>
    helpless, the desperate, walk<br>

    Don't take him too seriously, Dix.<br>
    His old lady's been giving him<br>
    a hard time. You know how it is.</p>

  <p> Whalen and Data continue to move about the room,<br>
    fascinated by everything from the chairs to the light<br>
    bulbs. To them, this is a firsthand look at ancient<br>
    history.</p>
  <p> Beverly is once again struggling with her handbag when<br>
    she notices that the desk sergeant is staring at her...</p>

  <p> SERGEANT<br>
    Yeah. But I'm not sure I can<br>
    repeat it in mixed company.<br>
    (leering)<br>
    You're a pretty hep lookin' broad.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Is that good?</p>
  <p> SERGEANT<br>
    It ain't bad. You like Charlie<br>

    McCarthy?... Oh, you mean the man<br>
    who hunted Communist witches.</p>
  <p> SERGEANT<br>

    I got two tickets to the show<br>
    tomorrow night.</p>
  <p> DATA (O.S.)<br>
    Do you mind if I experiment with<br>
    this device?</p>
  <p> Data is standing beside the desk, gazing at a vending<br>
    machine. The sergeant is greatly annoyed at being<br>
    interrupted while making his move.</p>
  <p> SERGANT<br>
    I don't care what you do.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thanks, Mac.</p>
  <p> The sergeant is about to continue, but is once again<br>
    sidetracked by Data. The android is going haywire,<br>
    pulling lever after lever at super speed. The sergeant<br>
    can't believe his eyes.</p>

  <p> Bell and McNary have been arguing in a corner of the<br>

    he's won for the time being.</p>
  <p> McNARY<br>
    Okay Dix. We're bustin' you out<br>
    of here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    That's welcome news.</p>

    You better not try to leave town.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    It's been a pleasure, sir.</p>
  <p> Bell glowers at him and EXITS the room, slamming the<br>
    door behind him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (dryly)<br>
    I get the feeling he doesn't like<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> McNARY<br>
    We know you're dealing with The<br>
    Fat Man, Dixon. Take it from a<br>
    friend; it doesn't help your case.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll keep it in mind.</p>
  <p> He rises and offers his hand to McNary. For some<br>
    reason it really does feel like he's an old and trusted<br>
    friend.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you. For helping me.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    Soon, my friend. But at the<br>
    moment I have other duties.</p>
  <p> McNARY<br>
    Blonde or brunette?</p>
  <p> The two men share a laugh. McNary opens the door...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (choosing his words)<br>
    She's a lady all right... and her<br>
    name's Enterprise.</p>
  <p> McNARY<br>
    Sounds like a working girl.<br>
    (laughs)<br>
    I'll stop by the office with a<br>
    bottle of scotch. You can tell<br>
    me all about her.</p>

  <p> Picard steps out into the waiting room.</p>
  <p> WHALEN<br>
    Have a good time?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not sure. Sometimes it seemed<br>
    too real.<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    Glad you could make it.<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't see why not.</p>
  <p> Picard leads them to the door. Data begins to<br>
    struggle with the doorknob. He pushes and pulls on<br>
    it as the others look on in amusement. Finally Whalen<br>
    reaches over and shows him the way. Picard pulls the<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry Mister Leech, but we<br>
    really must be going. Call again<br>
    tomorrow.</p>
  <p> Leech follows them, growing angry...</p>
  <p> LEECH<br>
    You're being quite rude, Mister<br>
    Hill. You haven't even introduced<br>
    me to your charming companions.</p>

  <p> Whalen takes another step -- a SHOT RINGS OUT. The<br>

    How could this happen?</p>
  <p> LEECH<br>
    It'll happen again if you don't<br>
    cooperate.</p>
  <p> Picard is furious. He lunges at Leech, striking him<br>
    and knocking the gun from his hands. Leech is<br>
    startled, backing out of the room, wide-eyed...</p>
  <p> LEECH<br>

    Suggestions, Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am at a loss. We are in a<br>
    Holodeck-created building of 1941.<br>
    The computer has refused to accept<br>

    the room from the overhead lights. Data replaces the<br>

  <p> LEECH<br>

    He's not from this world. None<br>

  <p> REDBLOCK<br>
    Hardly! Senseless killing is<br>
    immoral. But killing for a<br>
