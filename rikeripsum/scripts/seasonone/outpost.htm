    &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - STARSHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A DOT OF LIGHT becomes a starship, as the USS Enterprise<br>
    rockets directly TOWARD CAMERA, driving hard at warp<br>
    speed... in chase.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 41194.6.<br>
    We are in pursuit of a starship<br>
    of Ferengi design. Our mission<br>
    is...</p>
  <p>2 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> At their regular stations, intent upon the chase, are<br>
    PICARD, RIKER, TROI, DATA, GEORDI, TASHA and WORF.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... to intercept and recover a T-9<br>
    energy converter which the Ferengi<br>
    stole from an unmanned monitor<br>
    post on Gamma Tauri IV -- a theft<br>
    which automatic scanners recorded,<br>
    providing us...</p>
  <p>3 ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Part of the vast galaxy STARFIELD, streaking by as the<br>
    Enterprise plummets through in high warp. A computer<br>
    targeting CIRCLE silently searches the screen.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... with the long awaited<br>
    opportunity to make close contact<br>
    with a Ferengi vessel. If we<br>
    succeed in this chase, it<br>
    will be Starfleet's first look<br>
    at a life form... which discounting<br>
    rumor, we know almost nothing<br>
    about.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The circle stops, brightens, BEEPS -- a signal &quot;on<br>
    target.&quot;</p>
  <p>4 EMPHASIZING PICARD</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There she is!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Enlarge.</p>
  <p>5 ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The circle becomes a magnifier, homing in on a<br>
    non-moving PINPOINT OF LIGHT, as the outside scene<br>
    continues to streak.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is their course?</p>
  <p>6 INTERCUT PRINCIPALS AND VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> All eyes are intent on the viewscreen. Considerable<br>
    excitement on the bridge in anticipation of seeing the<br>
    Ferengi vessel. Suddenly the growing pinpoint veers<br>
    sharply left.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They are now angling through that<br>
    solar system, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Identify.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Listed as Delphi Ardu, sir.<br>
    Eleven planets, unexplored.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Stay with them, La Forge.</p>
  <p> The Enterprise readjusts, and the starfield shifts to<br>
    the right, placing its target back &quot;on center.&quot; Another<br>
    BEEP as that occurs.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Sensors read a power surge on<br>
    their last maneuver, Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They are dropping to sub-warp<br>
    speed... !</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    Reduce to impulse power... !</p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> showing WARP TO SUBWARP EFFECT.</p>
  <p>8 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - INTERCUT PRINCIPALS AND VIEWER<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Ferengi vessel becoming LARGER, but its shape and<br>
    details still undefined.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Sensor fluctuations in the energy<br>
    readings from it, Captain.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Possibility: a malfunction in<br>
    their engines, sir.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Breaks my heart.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    In visual range, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Fully enlarge!</p>
  <p> On screen APPEARS the FERENGI STARSHIP: a strange<br>
    horseshoe crab-like design, a bit smaller than the<br>
    Enterprise. The alien vessel is now passing near a<br>
    CLOUDED PLANET.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hello, stranger!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very impressive design.</p>
  <p> From their reaction, the Bridge Crew realize this is an<br>
    historic moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Anything on that design, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Nothing specific, sir. As you<br>
    know, Ferengi technology is<br>
    estimated to be generally equal<br>
    to our own...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Which does not mean identical,<br>
    however...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Correct, sir. We are no doubt<br>
    advanced in some areas, they in<br>
    others...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (interrupts)<br>
    They show another power surge,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> Then from the Ferengi starcraft, an electric-wave ARC<br>
    RIPPLES out and back from the trailing sides. It is<br>
    something like a spacebourne stingray.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They are firing on us!</p>
  <p> The viewscreen abruptly FLARES as the neon-bright arc<br>
    hits the Enterprise's forward quarter! (OPTICAL) All<br>
    the Bridge lights dim and come back up from the<br>
    crackling pulse attack!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Damage report!</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Shields holding!</p>

    Mostly electromagnetic, sir.<br>
    Fusion generator and batteries<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (interrupts)<br>
    Our impulse engines are surging!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They're firing again.</p>
  <p> And then ANOTHER ARC hits! A second FLARE! (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Deflector shield power weakening,<br>
    Captain.<br>
    (looks up)<br>
    Phasers ready, sir. Photon<br>
    torpedoes ready...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Shall we return their fire,<br>
    sir... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Negative, Number One. They are<br>
    reacting to close pursuit.<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Fall back a bit but stay with<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> On the viewer, the Ferengi starship now swivels toward<br>
    the Enterprise, pointing a snakehead-like prow in our<br>
    direction.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    They are slowing too, sir.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    They may be turning to fight!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Open hailing freq...<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Why are we gaining on them? Don't<br>
    anticipate...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm not, sir! Something's wrong...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, something is dragging us<br>
    forward.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, I read it, too. Lieutenant<br>
    Yar, what do your sensors show?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Not certain, sir. I'm getting very<br>
    confusing readings.</p>
  <p>9 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND FERENGI STARSHIP<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Both spacecraft are moving toward adjacent orbits of<br>
    the clouded planet.</p>

  <p>10 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - INTERCUTTING MAIN VIEWER<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> On the viewscreen, the planet plus the Ferengi vessel<br>
    even closer now.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, this shouldn't be. Our<br>
    ship's power systems are failing!</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Deflector shields failing, phasers<br>
    going inoperative, sir...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Something is completely<br>
    immobilizing us, Captain!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Immobilized by the damn Ferengi?!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I need more information! Identify<br>
    what they are using!</p>
  <p>11 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND FERENGI VESSEL (OPTICAL))</p>
  <p> in orbit of the planet, now locked together by that<br>
    &quot;something.&quot;</p>
  <p>12 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> all his bridge crew intently seeking an answer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Obviously we've underestimated<br>
    their technology, Captain...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods, rises;<br>
    alarmed)<br>
    Considerably. It appears the<br>
    Ferengi have us right where they<br>
    want us -- in their sights.</p>
  <p> CAMERA TIGHTENS PAST our troubled command team to the<br>
    Main Viewscreen, on which the mysterious Ferengi<br>
    starship challenges the Enterprise, floating under the<br>
    murky globe above, as we:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>

    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Locked in adjacent orbit of the nearby clouded planet.</p>
  <p>14 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> as the professionals go about their business. Picard<br>
    turns to Tasha:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are we searching all frequencies?<br>
    Any sign of any kind of message?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Negative, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Weapon report, Lieutenant Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have phasers and torpedoes<br>
    armed, but I show insufficient<br>
    power to fire them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Engineering, give me status on<br>
    power recovery.<br>
    (waits; no answer)<br>
    Engineering, come in.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Why aren't they answering?<br>
    (waits; turns<br>
    to Geordi)<br>
    Go below, Lieutenant. Get me a<br>
    full report from Engineering.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Geordi EXITS to the turbolift, as Riker studies the<br>
    viewer.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    It seems impossible they could<br>
    be draining all power from all<br>
    systems.</p>
  <p> Troi is still facing the viewer, her face a picture of<br>
    concentration, of mental penetration.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm sensing nothing from them<br>
    Captain. Which could mean they<br>
    can shield their thoughts and<br>
    emotions from others.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Which still makes it our move.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Sir, they may know as little about<br>
    us as we do about them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Except that they know they've got<br>
    us in deep trouble.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If so, the question becomes how<br>
    will they use that knowledge?<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Is there any hard information on<br>
    them in any file, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    None, sir. Only hearsay and<br>
    thirdhand reports, most of which<br>
    conflict.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Which rumors do not conflict?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That the Ferengi are... well, the<br>
    best description may be &quot;traders.&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What kind of &quot;traders&quot;?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A more accurate comparison modern<br>
    scholars have drawn from Earth<br>
    history cites the ocean-going<br>
    &quot;Yankee Traders&quot; of eighteenth<br>
    and nineteenth century America,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    From the history of my forebears?<br>
    &quot;Yankee Traders?&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Who sail, in this case the<br>
    galaxy, in search of mercantile<br>
    and territorial opportunity.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And are those scholars saying<br>
    the Ferengi may not be too<br>
    different from us?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Hardly, sir. I believe this<br>
    analogy refers to the nefarious<br>
    capitalist manner in which the<br>
    Ferengi are known to conduct their<br>
    affairs of commerce.<br>
    (thought)<br>
    &quot;Never give a sucker an even<br>
    break.&quot;</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker exchange puzzled looks.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And what does that mean, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I'm not sure, sir. That entry was<br>
    only identified as &quot;slang&quot;, terms<br>
    or expressions which typify<br>
    everyday language of...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know what slang is, Data. I just<br>
    haven't heard of that particular<br>
    saying.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But &quot;Yankee Traders&quot;...<br>
    (smile)<br>
    I like the sound of that. Has a<br>
    nice historical ring to it.</p>

    One. Without our warp capacity,<br>
    we're just one big floating<br>
    target.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker's OFF to the turbolift, as Picard studies the<br>
    viewer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    What other pertinent meaning do<br>
    you draw from this analogy,<br>
    &quot;Yankee Traders?&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Well, I doubt if they wear red,<br>
    white and blue, sir. Or look<br>
    anything like Uncle Sam.</p>
  <p> Except for Picard, Data meets uncomprehending stares.<br>
    (That allusion dates too far back from the twenty-fourth<br>
    century.)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Uncle who?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    What have bright, primal colors<br>
    got to do with it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, I understand the allusion.<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Colors that once identified<br>
    nations during the time when they<br>
    competed against each other. Red,<br>
    white and blue for the United<br>
    States...<br>

    Whereas the French oddly used the<br>
    same colors in the order of blue,<br>
    white, and red...</p>

    red and gold; the Italians green,<br>

    We're discussing the Ferengi,<br>
    Data!<br>
    (slow burn)<br>
    Mon Dieu, I wish I knew what they<br>
    will do next...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Given what is occurring to our<br>
    vessel, Captain, their weapons<br>
    could be vastly superior to ours.</p>
  <p> Picard has to fight off irritation again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Data. That seems a<br>
    reasonable assumption.<br>
    (louder)<br>
    Engineering?!</p>
  <p> But Picard is still without an answer.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Bottom line, La Forge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not good, sir. The Ferengi<br>
    forcefield that holds this ship<br>
    compensates...<br>
    (taps board)<br>
    Almost as fast as we increase<br>
    power.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Almost?</p>
  <p> Using his hands as a demonstration, Geordi tries to<br>
    explain the &quot;isometric&quot; problem of the forcefield.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>

    And what is our acceleration delay<br>
    between slow-reverse impulse and<br>
    top warp speed?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Point-three-hundred millisecond.<br>
    (big smile)<br>
    I know what you're thinking. Shift<br>
    down and then blow hard into warp<br>
    nine, yes? Come back fighting,<br>
    whooey!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Can we do it, Geordi?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Ask me after it's done, sir.<br>
    (to Engineers)<br>
    I want a slow reverse-power<br>
    drop-off over five minutes...<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    We'll show them what this baby<br>
    can do, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Give me everything you've got.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, aye, sir.</p>
  <p> At that, Riker EXITS, as CAMERA TIGHTENS on Geordi.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    ... and with a sudden, abrupt power<br>
    surge to high warp speed, Captain,<br>
    I believe we can break loose from<br>
    the Ferengi forcefield.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I wish I knew how they are doing<br>
    this to us.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I wonder what they're thinking<br>
    over there.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's easy. They're wondering<br>
    what we are thinking... and what<br>
    we might do next.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I say fight, sir. There is<br>
    nothing shameful in falling before<br>
    a superior enemy.</p>
  <p> Geordi ENTERS the Bridge from the turbolift.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (thin smile at Worf)<br>
    And nothing shameful about a<br>

    Attention Ferengi starship! This<br>
    is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the<br>
    USS Enterprise. In the name of<br>
    the United Federation of Planets,<br>
    I demand you return the T-9 energy<br>
    converter you removed from Gamma<br>
    Tauri IV.<br>
    (to Tasha; normal voice)<br>
    Send in all language forms.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    All language forms, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sometimes, Riker, the best way<br>
    to win a fight is not to be there.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir. &quot;He will triumph who<br>
    knows when to fight and when not<br>
    to fight.&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Glad the Academy still teaches<br>
    the strategy of Sun Tzu...<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Let's hope that delay proves out,<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    All systems ready, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Countdown to three. Stand by on<br>
    phasers.<br>
    (firm)<br>
    One. Set warp to nine.<br>
    (everyone tenses)<br>

  <p> With the massive jolt of power let go from the combined<br>

    What's wrong?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In my opinion, someone is reading<br>

  <p> Picard CROSSING Bridge, checks the Main Viewer on which<br>
    the cloud shrouded planet is prominent, although not<br>
    particularly unusual from this perspective. Picard<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Consult the charts on this<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    We had no response.<br>

    So, while we still have some power<br>
    left, it is time for difficult<br>
    decisions.<br>
    (thin smile)<br>
    While we cannot have a democracy<br>
    aboard, I value your considered<br>

  <p> Tasha is the first to look up.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    I say put all available power into<br>
    a full-out combined phaser and<br>
    photon torpedo salvo. Destroy<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes! Hit them hard and hit them<br>

    Impractical and provocative.<br>
    Assuming even that we have the<br>
    power to support that tactic.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    But Captain, firing on us was not<br>
    an act of war?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The facts are that the Ferengi<br>
    did fire at us, but we were<br>
    chasing them. Since then, they've<br>
    only searched our computers,<br>
    trying to learn who and what we<br>
    are.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your point, Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Let's talk to them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That has been tried; no response.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But did we tell them anything they<br>
    wanted to hear?</p>
  <p> There's not a person present who doesn't know the<br>
    implication of that statement.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any other observations?</p>
  <p> Picard waits; there are none.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Thank you all for your advice and<br>
    counsel. Now if you will excuse<br>
    me, I'd like to be left alone with<br>
    Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> All his Officers EXIT the Conference Room, except Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As my first officer, I assume you<br>
    fully realize our situation.<br>
    Although the final decision must<br>
    be mine, this is your opportunity<br>

    Are there any other options you<br>
    wish to analyze?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The only one left needs no<br>

    I am, ah...<br>
    (futile tug)<br>
    Stuck.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then get unstuck and continue your<br>
    briefing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. That is what I am trying<br>
    to do...<br>
    (no go again)<br>
    But the solution eludes me.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (laughs)<br>
    My hero.</p>
  <p> Picard reaches over, grabs Data's hands in his own and<br>
    pushes in... releasing Data's trapped fingers.</p>

    Continue, Commander. Now!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (eyeing the puzzle)<br>
    Intriguing.<br>
    (then quickly indicating<br>
    viewscreen)<br>
    Again, only legend, but it<br>
    describes the Empire as impossibly<br>
    huge and powerful.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (eyeing viewscreen)<br>
    Surrounded by stars whose planets<br>
    formed its defensive system?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Correct, sir. Outposts. And the<br>
    planet below was possibly one of<br>
    them...</p>
  <p> Interrupted by the Bos'n SIGNAL, followed by:</p>
  <p> TASHA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Excuse the interruption, Captain,<br>
    but this may be worth it. We're<br>
    now receiving a signal from the<br>
    probe.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll take it here, please.</p>
  <p> The VIEWSCREEN FLICKERS, BECOMES AN IMAGE SHOWING<br>
    PLANET, FERENGI VESSEL, AND THE ENTERPRISE. WAVY,<br>
    PULSATING, EERIE-GREEN CURVLINEAR LINES reach up<br>
    mushroom-like from a point on the planet surface -- up<br>
    and around the two space vessels.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Incredible!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's our mysterious &quot;something,&quot;<br>
    Captain. It is a forcefield of<br>
    some kind...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Reaching up from the planet<br>
    surface. What enormous power!<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    How does the legend describe the<br>
    end of the Tkon Empire?</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Could this planet have escaped<br>
    that?</p>
  <p>28 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Data touches the panel and VIEWER IMAGE CHANGES BACK TO<br>
    THE TKON EMPIRE CHART. He indicates a distant one of<br>
    the surrounding stars.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This planet, Gamma Tauri IV,<br>
    could have been the most distant<br>
    outpost, sir, in theory. But<br>
    since it shows no life form readings...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    We'll have to look it over, Number<br>
    One. Stand by with an away team.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (stands)<br>
    And if the Ferengi also realize<br>
    the forcefield emanates from the<br>
    planet, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (considers it)<br>
    That's a complication. We may<br>
    have to ask them to join us in<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Team up with the Ferengi, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We were ordered to learn what we<br>
    can about them. Do you know of<br>
    a better way than that?</p>

  <p>30 INT. ENTERPRISE MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE INCLUDING<br>
    VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The viewer carries an IMAGE of the planet. The bridge<br>
    crew is tense, awaiting communications with the Ferengi.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... there is a solution to this,<br>
    it almost certainly will involve<br>
    cooperation from the Ferengi...<br>
    a life form which seems as unknown<br>
    and mysterious as the planet we<br>
    orbit.</p>
  <p>31 ANGLE INCLUDING TASHA</p>
  <p> as she looks from the panel to the Captain.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Ship's power drain is critical,<br>
    Captain. I must now shut down<br>
    our shields to maintain life<br>

    Understood, Lieutenant. Open<br>

  <p>32 ANGLES INCLUDING VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Main Viewer ripples into IMAGE OF THE FACE OF DAIMON<br>
    TAAR again -- and it is still lens-twisted, appearing as<br>
    large and foreboding as before. He looks up at the<br>
    screen and then:</p>
  <p> TAAR<br>
    Your alien images again shock us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    DaiMon Tarr, regarding your<br>
    surrender to us, the facts are<br>
    somewhat different...</p>
  <p> TAAR<br>
    (interrupting; angrily)<br>
    Our own probe has already shown<br>
    us your trickery, hu-man.<br>
    (emphatic)<br>
    We withdraw our surrender.</p>
  <p> Picard has exchanged a look with Riker. He nods toward<br>
    the viewer:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed, DaiMon. May this may be<br>
    a far more productive<br>
    relationship.</p>
  <p> TAAR<br>
    I prefer a profitable one, hu-man.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (quietly, toward Picard)<br>
    &quot;Yankee Traders.&quot;</p>
  <p> TAAR<br>
    (bristling)<br>
    Explain. What means this<br>
    &quot;yangeetraters&quot;?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    He heard that?</p>
  <p> Picard gives Data an irritated look, searches for an<br>
    answer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It... acknowledges your interest<br>
    in profit, DaiMon Taar. Is that<br>
    an incorrect assumption?</p>
  <p> TAAR<br>
    We seek only what is equitable.<br>
    (angrily)<br>
    What do you seek? Why did you<br>
    begin by attacking us?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We did not attack. We gave chase<br>
    in order to recover a<br>
    Federation-owned energy device<br>
    which...</p>
  <p> TAAR<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    ... which we know is ours. Your<br>
    barbarous Federation chose to<br>
    place it on one of our planets!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On the contrary, Gamma Tauri IV<br>
    is recognized by all civilized<br>
    members of...</p>
  <p> TAAR<br>
    (outraged)<br>
    The Ferengi are not uncivilized,<br>
    hu-man! Is that what you<br>
    suggest?!</p>
  <p> Picard takes a breath, this is not going well.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All I am trying to say is you have<br>
    taken a device clearly not your<br>
    own from...</p>
  <p> TAAR<br>
    (incredulous)<br>
    Are you now calling us thieves?!</p>
  <p> Picard shifts to a different tack, to let off Ferengi<br>
    steam.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Certainly not. And I have no wish<br>
    to argue issues of territory or<br>
    property, when our mutual problem<br>
    remains. Like it or not...<br>
    (firm)<br>
    We are both trapped by the power<br>
    draining forcefield of this<br>
    planet.</p>
  <p> TAAR<br>
    (lets up)<br>
    On that matter, there can be no<br>
    argument.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Might I propose a swap?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Taar's face grimaces at the foul-sounding new word.</p>
  <p> TAAR<br>
    And... what is a &quot;szwop&quot;?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    An exchange, a trade...</p>
  <p> TAAR<br>
    Yes, trade, hu-man. What is your<br>
    offer?</p>
  <p> Picard's getting somewhere, and Troi acknowledges the<br>
    progress with a smile to her captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We will give you what we know<br>
    about the planet, and in trade,<br>
    you will give us your information.</p>
  <p> TAAR<br>
    Ridiculous. How will we know you<br>
    have not cheated us?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We must trust each other, Taar.</p>
  <p> Tarr responds with a grating laugh at this idea.</p>
  <p> TAAR<br>
    Amusing, hu-man. But impractical.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then may I propose we both<br>
    cooperate in a joint examination<br>
    of the planet surface?</p>
  <p> TAAR<br>
    And what profit is in this, Picard<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The profit, DaiMon Tarr, lies in<br>
    saving all our lives.</p>
  <p> Taar considers a beat, then answers, a deal being done.</p>
  <p> TAAR<br>
    We will agree to this. But I warn<br>
    you now, any further trickery on<br>
    your part will be met with no<br>
    mercy. Understood?</p>

  <p>32 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Understood.<br>
    (onward)<br>
    If you care to join us, we have<br>
    a well-proven transporter<br>
    device which...</p>
  <p> TAAR<br>
    We have a matter-energy device<br>
    of our own. We will beam a<br>
    science team of three to whatever<br>
    coordinates you propose.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Excellent. We will transmit that<br>
    information shortly. Enterprise<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> Picard nods at Tasha.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Hailing frequencies off.</p>
  <p> The Main Viewer has returned to an image of the Ferengi<br>
    vessel and the planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll log that as &quot;promising,&quot; at<br>
    least.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I wonder, Captain. Ordinarily,<br>
    I don't believe in distrust at<br>
    first sight... but this may be<br>
    an exception.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Especially in view of the fact<br>
    the image he transmitted was<br>
    likely distorted somehow, sir.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I felt the same thing, Captain.<br>
    He was hiding something.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (stands)<br>
    With this power drain I see no<br>
    reason to delay, sir.<br>
    (looks around)<br>
    I'd like some additional help<br>
    on this. Can you spare Worf?</p>

  <p>32 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Take him. And be careful, Number<br>
    One.</p>
  <p> Riker CROSSES toward the turbolift, FOLLOWED by Data,<br>
    Geordi, Tasha and Worf. Their Bridge positions are<br>
    immediately filled.</p>
  <p>33 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> A strong away team of five: Riker, Data, Tasha, Geordi<br>

    couple of large ones, plus a couple of tricorders. They<br>
    step onto the &quot;pads.&quot;</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER CHIEF<br>
    With this power drain, we may have<br>
    trouble communicating with you,<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Understood. Anything else?</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER CHIEF<br>
    (reluctant)<br>
    Due to this forcefield, there is<br>
    presently no way... to beam you<br>
    back, sir.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You had to ask.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Understood.<br>

    hanging heavily over a strange landscape of coral-like<br>
    &quot;trees.&quot; LIGHTNING explodes above, as a dull THUNDER<br>
    echoes through this eerie labyrinth.</p>
  <p> In a relatively clear area, Riker suddenly<br>
    materializes... alone! He's woozy, but in one piece.<br>
    He looks around, perplexed, worried.</p>

    crook... and not moving.</p>

    Geordi!</p>
  <p>41 BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> With difficulty, Riker and Data make their way to their<br>
    hapless crewmember. Geordi is motionless, maybe dead.<br>
    Riker reaches through the tangle.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Geordi?! Are you conscious?</p>
  <p> A beat, then Geordi smiles. Data runs a tricorder<br>
    nearby.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Do I look conscious?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No. What are you doing?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Trying to relax, sir. My foot's<br>
    caught...<br>

    Up there. I materialized upside<br>

    Tricorder is useless here, sir.<br>

  <p>42 POV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Backlit by LIGHTNING, THREE SMALL, HAIRLESS HUMANOIDS<br>
    with protruding cupped ears, dressed in strange<br>
    clothing. They are armed with odd whip-like weapons.</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    Who are you?</p>
  <p> At that, the Leader snaps his whip toward them,<br>

    TOWARD CAMERA (OPTICAL).</p>
  <p>43 CLOSE - OUR TEAM</p>
  <p> Riker, Data and lucky-day Geordi are whacked with the<br>

  <p> Sitting opposite Riker on a crystalline rock is a little<br>
    Ferengi humanoid, LETEK, leader of this group. His eyes<br>
    &quot;dart&quot; around birdlike as he studies the Starfleet<br>

    out alongside Geordi and Data. They are KAYRON and<br>
    MORDOC. At this time, Riker becomes sufficiently<br>
    conscious to groan.</p>
  <p> LETEK<br>
    If he moves, kill him.</p>
  <p> MORDOC<br>
    Letek, has what we've done broken<br>
    our agreement with their captain?</p>
  <p> LETEK<br>
    We will accuse the hu-mans of<br>
    preparing to ambush us. It will<br>
    be our word against theirs and<br>
    who is more trustworthy, Mordoc?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>51 CLOSE ON LETEK</p>
  <p> Beady-eyed and marginally blind, this dominant Ferengi<br>
    male examines his booty... holding it close-up because<br>
    of Ferengi weak eyesight.</p>
  <p> LETEK<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    Hmmm. Looks like gold...<br>
    (gives it a lick)<br>
    ... tastes like gold.</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    It is gold!</p>
  <p> The alien leaps back from the unexpected sound, his whip<br>
    immediately in the air, poised to attack! Nearby,<br>
    useless to our crewmembers, are their phasers, insignias<br>
    and tricorders.</p>
  <p>52 BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> Riker's not going anywhere, having had a taste of the<br>
    Ferengi electronic whip. The alien over Riker, whip<br>
    ready... just as another clap of far-off THUNDER causes<br>
    it to howl and cover its ears in pain, as do the others!</p>
  <p> LETEK<br>
    (soft, low voice)<br>
    Accursed planet! What<br>
    pandemonium!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Nothing compared to what my<br>
    captain will do...<br>
    (sees he's causing pain;<br>
    speaks softly)<br>
    ... when he learns you've broken<br>
    our landing party agreement.</p>
  <p> LETEK<br>
    What part of the agreement?</p>
  <p> At that, Riker eases himself up, but the alien gestures<br>
    him back down, the &quot;whip&quot; its &quot;suggestion&quot;...</p>
  <p> LETEK<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You appeared and attacked us.<br>
    Are you one of their assassins?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>52 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I am Commander Riker, first<br>
    officer of the USS Enterprise.<br>
    Stop now unless you want our<br>
    vessel to retaliate...</p>
  <p> Upon which, Worf rolls to his feet with a LOUD and<br>
    frightening KLINGON GROWL. The Ferengi immediately clap<br>
    their hands to their ears and Worf goes for the one<br>
    called Mordoc nearest him. But Worf finds he has a<br>
    wildcat on his hands.</p>
  <p>53 ANOTHER ANGLE (SPECIAL EFFECT)</p>
  <p> The Ferengi called Kayron moves to aid Worf's opponent,<br>
    lifting his whip to strike, but Data &quot;leaps&quot; from his<br>
    prone position, moving with android speed and ease,<br>
    grabbing him by the wrist and pulling him at arm's<br>
    length off the ground. We HEAR THUNDER again, LOUDER.</p>
  <p>54 ANOTHER ANGLE - EMPHASIZING RIKER</p>
  <p> as the Ferengi leader, Letek, makes a move.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've got this one!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Careful, Commander, they're much<br>
    stronger than...</p>
  <p> Riker finds out how much stronger -- Letek smashes Riker<br>
    with a savage right-cross which rolls him over twice and<br>
    leaves him completely unconscious.</p>
  <p>55 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Data and Worf have their hands full.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (loudly)<br>
    PYGMY CRETINS... !</p>
  <p> Although with hands over his ears, protecting his<br>
    hearing, one of the Ferengi rolls, clamps his legs<br>
    around the huge Klingon and brings him to the ground,<br>
    hard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>56 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The remaining two Ferengi go after Data, one hitting him<br>
    hard and high, the other equally hard and low --<br>
    bringing Data to the ground. Letek scoops up his<br>
    &quot;whip.&quot;</p>
  <p> LETEK<br>
    Kill them.</p>
  <p> It sounds no less lethal that the Ferengi says it<br>
    quietly. As the other two scramble for their whips:</p>
  <p> MORDOC<br>
    (hissing quietly)<br>
    Hideous monsters!</p>
  <p> Kayron and Mordoc raise their &quot;whips&quot; to do the job,<br>
    when:</p>
  <p> TASHA (V. O.)<br>
    NOOO-O-O!!</p>
  <p> All three Ferengi wheel around, as:</p>
  <p>57 ANGLE WIDENS TO INCLUDE TASHA</p>
  <p> training a major phaser at the hapless Ferengi. The<br>
    small men let their &quot;whips&quot; drop, at Tasha's gesture.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    That's much better, now over<br>
    there...</p>
  <p> Letek and his &quot;men&quot; back off, incredulous, as Mordoc<br>
    points to Tasha.</p>
  <p> MORDOC<br>
    Is this a female?</p>
  <p> KYRON<br>
    A hu-man... female, Letek?</p>
  <p> The Ferengi are handling this with all the astonishment<br>
    of seeing man-eating tigers. The Ferengi squint<br>
    leeringly at Tasha.</p>
  <p> LETEK<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Then it is true. You work with<br>
    females, arm them, and force them<br>
    to wear clothing?</p>
  <p> MORDOC<br>
    How sickening.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>58 EXT. ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Nearly dark, as the lights weakly radiate. Beyond, the<br>
    Ferengi vessel is slightly better lit.</p>
  <p>59 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard comforts a crewmember, then CROSSES to Beverly.<br>
    They're both very cold and weak, GASP OUT their words.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I should visit... the family<br>
    decks...again...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (shakes head)<br>
    I've diverted... all reserve...<br>
    power there. They'll... last<br>
    longest.<br>
    (looks around)<br>
    Is there anything else we can do,<br>
    Doctor?</p>
  <p> Beverly shakes her head. Then Picard remembers<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Where is... your son Wesley?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I gave him... something. He'll<br>
    have a... terrible headache if we<br>
    live.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You shouldn't have.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Shouldn't have?<br>
    (weak but outraged)<br>
    He's my son. I love him...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He has the... right to meet...<br>
    death awake.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Beverly eyes Picard for a long moment before she answers<br>
    with a nod.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That is... a male perspective!</p>
  <p> From deep in his thermal blankets, Picard makes a<br>
    MUFFLED SOUND.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What?<br>
    (beat; louder)<br>
    What did you say, Jean-Luc?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I said... rubbish!</p>
  <p>60 EXT. PLANET SURFACE</p>
  <p> The Ferengi are clearly unafraid of the larger humans<br>
    and Tasha has had to be alert with her phaser to keep<br>
    them in place. But now the Ferengi have evolved a plan.<br>
    It begins with Letek seeming asleep -- the other two<br>
    suddenly striding OFF. Tasha brings her phaser up:</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Stop! Hold it right there!</p>
  <p>61 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The two Ferengi are ignoring Tasha. (We're also now<br>
    HEARING the mysterious THUNDER SOUND nearer and LOUDER.)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Set for stun!</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Already set.</p>
  <p> In b.g. WE SEE Letek suddenly moving for his &quot;whip&quot;<br>
    device as a baffled Tasha sends out a PHASER EFFECT<br>
    which heads straight for the Ferengi but then ARCS IN<br>
    A CURVE AND ENCIRCLES THE LARGEST NEARBY CORAL TREE.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    What is going on?!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>62 ANGLE EMPHASIZING LETEK</p>
  <p> With the attention of the human on the phaser, Letek<br>
    snatches up his &quot;whip&quot; device and SNAPS it toward the<br>
    humans. They turn in time to the WHIP EFFECT HEADED<br>
    IN THEIR DIRECTION -- BUT LIKE THE PHASER EFFECT IT<br>
    CURVES TOWARD THE &quot;CORAL&quot; TREE AND DISSIPATES THERE.</p>
  <p> LETEK<br>
    What is this?!</p>
  <p>63 ANGLE ON HUMANS AND FERENGI</p>
  <p> Neither side is certain what to do next.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    How intriguing.<br>
    (to Humans and Ferengi)<br>
    I believe we can deduce these<br>
    crystalline tree-shapes to be<br>
    energy collectors.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Along the same principle that is<br>
    draining energy from our ships.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But the Ferengi weapons were<br>
    working when we arrived here...</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Which means something new has<br>
    happened...</p>
  <p> Interrupted by a BLAST OF THUNDER. Then more of the<br>
    strange THUNDER, CLOSER, STILL LOUDER. Pressing hands<br>
    over ears, the Ferengi are in agony. Geordi reacts at<br>
    something o.s., points.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Commander!</p>
  <p>64 ANGLE ON TKON OBJECT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A SPINNING, CLEAR CRYSTALLINE SHAPE, GIVING OFF RAINBOW<br>
    HUES as it MOVES INTO SCENE with the Humans and the<br>
    Ferengi, stopping there. Then, HALF-VOICE AND<br>
    HALF-THUNDER RUMBLE:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>64 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PORTAL FIGURE<br>
    BE YOU BARBARIANS?! SPEAK!</p>
  <p> But its defiant inquiry is met by silence from all, as<br>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>65 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - ANGLE ON PORTAL EFFECT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> continuing from ACT FOUR FADE OUT. Both humans and<br>
    Ferengi astonished at the SPINNING, CLEAR CRYSTALLINE<br>
    SHAPE WHICH GIVES OFF RAINBOW HUES AND THE SOUND OF<br>
    THUNDER RUMBLING.</p>
  <p> PORTAL<br>
    WHO MEETS THE CHALLENGE?</p>
  <p>66 ANGLE ON GEORDI AND RIKER</p>
  <p> Geordi concentrating on the spinning SHAPE, then turning<br>
    quickly to Riker.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm beginning to understand<br>
    what...<br>
    (touches VISOR)<br>
    ... these &quot;eyes&quot; have been showing<br>

  <p>67 WIDER ANGLE - INCLUDING SPINNING SHAPE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as again they HEAR the HALF-VOICE, HALF-THUNDER SOUND:</p>
  <p> PORTAL<br>
    WHO WILL IT BE?</p>
  <p> Nobody's volunteering. Letek looks to Riker, then to<br>
    his Ferengi cohorts. A beat, then Letek takes the<br>
    plunge...</p>

    Who asks the question?</p>
  <p>68 ANGLE ON PORTAL EFFECT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> With the LOUDEST SOUND OF ALL, A THUNDER CLAP AND<br>
    EXTENDED CRACKLING which cues ACCELERATED SPINNING to<br>
    where the CRYSTALLINE SHAPE BECOMES FUZZY AND DISSOLVES<br>
    INTO A TALL, THIN, AGED (make-up effect) HUMANOID FIGURE<br>

    Why should we petition for entry<br>

    exists?</p>
  <p>71 APPROPRIATE ANGLES - PER ACTION</p>
  <p> The Portal Figure examines the others, then looks down<br>
    at itself. It speaks now in a NORMAL VOICE but with a<br>
    slight ECHO-CHAMBER holdover.</p>
  <p> PORTAL<br>
    Biped...extraordinary.<br>

  <p> The away team members react, but Riker motions them into<br>
    silence.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    We invite their petition.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Excellent idea, sir.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    Speak.</p>
  <p> Letek thinks fast; this has happened almost too rapidly.</p>
  <p> LETEK<br>
    We... our petition is that we be<br>

  <p>71 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> The away team is desperate for Riker to make an answer<br>
    to this but he remains silent, awaiting the Portal<br>
    Figure's answer. Again the Portal gestures, but this<br>
    time to the Ferengi, then he turns back to Riker.</p>
  <p> PORTAL<br>
    You have attempted deceit. Next<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    (beat; considering this)<br>
    Yes. If you believe those<br>
    accusations, you should act on<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> The other away team members are shocked at Riker's<br>
    answer. Before the Portal can answer, Letek decides<br>
    to go for the &quot;kill.&quot;</p>
  <p> LETEK<br>
    And there is even more! We can<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>74 EMPHASIZING RIKER AND PORTAL FIGURE</p>
  <p> as the Figure takes a fighting stance.</p>
  <p> PORTAL<br>
    (mixed-THUNDER)<br>
    You have a single chance for life.<br>
    One only. What is the answer to<br>
    my challenge?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (facing Portal Figure,<br>
    unmoving)<br>
    There is more! Self-determination<br>
    of all peoples...</p>
  <p> Again, the Portal makes a strange gesture to Riker, in<br>
    deep concentration.</p>
  <p> PORTAL<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    You are being tested, Riker! WHAT<br>
    IS THE ANSWER?</p>
  <p> Riker looks up sharply, puzzled at this.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How do you know my name?</p>
  <p> The Portal Figure suddenly rushes at Riker, scimitar<br>
    held high... an earth-shattering SHRIEK. Riker stands<br>
    fast as:</p>
  <p>75 CLOSE ON RIKER AND PORTAL FIGURE</p>
  <p> Portal cuts through the air in an unstoppable overhead<br>
    sweep... Then, the ugly looking weapon stops a couple<br>
    millimeters from Riker's head! Riker remains<br>
    motionless, even calm, serene...</p>
  <p> PORTAL<br>
    Ahhh. You are of immovable mind,<br>
    Riker. One totally committed to<br>
    facing any fate with composure...<br>
    (sword still up)<br>
    But what is the answer to my<br>
    challenge?</p>
  <p> All the away team members hold their breath. Riker<br>
    remains quietly at ease. Is he taking too long?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>75 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Fear is the true enemy, the only<br>
    enemy.</p>
  <p> Portal tosses his weapon aside.</p>
  <p> PORTAL<br>
    You are a noble being. And unlike<br>
    these little ones who close their<br>
    minds, your mind holds interesting<br>
    thoughts.<br>
    (quoting)<br>
    &quot;Know your enemy and know<br>
    yourself, and victory will always<br>
    be yours.&quot; Why that thought? And<br>
    who is this &quot;Sun Tzu&quot; you revere?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    An old Chinese philosopher from<br>
    ancient Earth history...</p>
  <p> PORTAL<br>
    You must tell me more of this<br>
    wisdom so much like our own.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Gladly. First, our starship. Can<br>
    you release it?</p>
  <p> PORTAL<br>
    (nods)<br>
    It is released.<br>
    (looks upward, nods)<br>
    All power is restored.</p>
  <p>76 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> suddenly freed, the LIGHTS back up to full strength!</p>
  <p>77 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> as all power is restored, the bridge lights and a/c<br>
    return to norm, not a lot too late. The crew begin to<br>
    stir. Picard gets to his feet fast, but weakly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>78 CLOSE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> opens his eyes, taking in a deep, fresh breath. He<br>
    looks around. Beverly ENTERS SHOT.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not a hell of a lot too soon,<br>
    Jean...Captain.</p>
  <p>79 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - VARIOUS ANGLES</p>
  <p> with the Ferengi showing concerned expressions.</p>
  <p> PORTAL<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    I admit I had my doubts as your<br>
    ships battled each other...</p>
  <p> LETEK<br>
    They tried to kill us!</p>
  <p> PORTAL<br>
    (ignores him)<br>
    In overt acts of belligerance.<br>
    Normally, I would have destroyed<br>
    all of you and your ships, but<br>
    something confused me.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Which was?</p>
  <p> PORTAL<br>
    First you wanted to murder each<br>
    other, then you were willing to<br>
    help each other.</p>
  <p> Letek's not one to be ignored, roughly forcing himself<br>
    in front of Riker, his cohorts nearby.</p>
  <p> LETEK<br>
    What of our vessel? We knew the<br>
    same answer...</p>
  <p> MORDOC<br>
    The truth is I gave those words<br>
    to this hu-man.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>79 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PORTAL<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    What of them? Shall I destroy<br>
    them?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then they would learn nothing.</p>
  <p> PORTAL<br>
    Admirable conclusion. But what<br>
    makes you think they will ever<br>
    learn, Riker?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Is this a test also?</p>
  <p> The Ferengi start to intrude again, but the Portal<br>
    quickly silences them with a deadly wave of his hand.</p>
  <p> PORTAL<br>
    In life, one is always tested.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I find them very much as we were<br>
    a few hundred years ago... but<br>
    with the technology we have now.<br>
    They're very dangerous...</p>
  <p> KAYRON<br>
    (can't help the lie)<br>
    Untrue! We seek friendship with<br>
    you...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (unhearing; to Portal)<br>
    But we can hardly hate what we<br>
    once were. They may grow and<br>
    learn...</p>
  <p> PORTAL<br>
    ... And learn ways of destroying<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Our values require us to face that<br>
    possibility. What of you? With<br>
    your empire gone... ?</p>
  <p> PORTAL<br>
    Even without the empire, the<br>
    uncivilized must be tested.<br>
    (sadly)<br>
    I shall sleep... until needed<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; - 8/7/87 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>

    DATA</p>
  <p> ENTERING from the turbolift. Troi, CROSSING in from the<br>
    Ready Room, intercepts them.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Something to write home about.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    &quot;Something to write home about?&quot;<br>
    Data, that's very human.</p>
  <p> Data is very pleased at that. Meanwhile, Riker has<br>
    ARRIVED, CROSSES to the Command Area.</p>
  <p>82 EMPHASIZING PICARD</p>
  <p> as Riker joins him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The T-9 energy converter was<br>
    beamed aboard and secured, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I commend your performance, Number<br>
    One.</p>
  <p> Data has also returned to his forward &quot;Ops&quot; station,<br>
    carefully placing his finger puzzle above his console.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I do have a request, sir.</p>
  <p>83 CLOSE ON RIKER</p>
  <p> A wicked thought.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Permission to beam a box of Data's<br>
    Chinese finger puzzles over to<br>
    the Ferengi.<br>
    (postscript)<br>
    A &quot;thank you&quot; for all they tried<br>
    to do.</p>
