  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>A1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> orbiting the planet Relva 7.</p>
  <p>B1 INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> WESLEY is running down the corridor after someone.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Hey, Jake! Wait a second!</p>
  <p> JAKE KURLAND, eighteen, dark-haired and intense, stops<br>
    and waits for Wesley.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    How're you doing?</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    (tries to smile)<br>
    I'm fine. Really.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm real sorry...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Acting Ensign Crusher, report to<br>
    Deck Twenty-one Forward Lounge.</p>
  <p> Wesley ignores the request.</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    It's not your fault.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, I know, but I wish we were<br>
    both going.</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    (shrugging)<br>
    Only thirty-two points...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Acting Ensign Crusher, respond.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Coming Of Age&quot; - 12/30/87 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>B1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Wesley touches a com panel.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm on my way.</p>
  <p> Wesley looks at Jake.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Gotta go.</p>
  <p> They shake hands.</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    Do well for both of us.</p>
  <p> Wesley smiles at Jake and HURRIES BACK the other way.<br>
    Jake stares dejectedly after him.</p>
  <p>C1 INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE DECK 21 FORWARD LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Beverly waits for Wesley just outside the lounge.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Mom, I can't be late.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Don't worry. You have time.</p>
  <p>1 INT. DECK 21 FORWARD LOUNGE</p>
  <p> A large cake with seventeen BURNING candles is in the<br>
    center of the table. It says &quot;HAPPY 16TH BIRTHDAY&quot; and<br>
    &quot;GOOD LUCK, WESLEY.&quot; The whole BRIDGE CREW waits<br>
    around the table as Wesley ENTERS with Beverly. He's<br>
    touched, embarrassed and -- wants to get out of there.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Happy Birthday, Wesley!</p>
  <p> Everyone ECHOES THE SENTIMENT.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Thanks everybody. But it's not<br>
    until next month.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Close enough.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Coming Of Age&quot; - 12/30/87 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You won't be here next month.<br>
    After you pass the entrance exam,<br>
    you'll be on your way to Starfleet<br>
    Academy.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Go on, make a wish.</p>
  <p> Wesley closes his eyes, thinks a moment, then blows out<br>
    the candles. Everyone CLAPS as he makes the first cut.<br>
    Troi takes over and cuts cake for everyone, handing<br>
    pieces to Riker and Wesley.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You'll breeze through those<br>
    tests.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I hope so, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I know so. I remember how tough<br>
    it was for me.</p>
  <p> He pauses, reliving the fear, then smiles at Wesley.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But you've got brains, and family<br>
    tradition, and actual experience.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I wish I felt that sure.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I was scared to death the whole<br>
    time. But it's good for you.<br>
    Keeps your adrenaline going. Not<br>
    that you'll need it, Wes.</p>
  <p>1A ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Troi hands pieces of cake to Data and Worf.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Coming Of Age&quot; - 12/30/87 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>1A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you... Humans are<br>
    fascinating. They celebrate the<br>
    passage of time with such joy<br>
    until a certain age, and then it<br>
    becomes a topic of some<br>
    discomfort. I suppose it is<br>
    because each birthday is another<br>
    step towards inevitable death.<br>
    Do Klingons observe birthdays,<br>
    Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Klingons are born, live as<br>
    warriors, and die.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then how do you know how old you<br>
    are?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I don't. Do you know?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have no age.</p>
  <p> Data stares at Beverly, who's standing next to Picard.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Is there something wrong?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No. I am simply trying to<br>
    understand the celebration of<br>
    aging. And how old were you when<br>
    Wesley was born, Doctor?</p>
  <p> Beverly shoves her piece of cake at him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Have some cake, Data.</p>
  <p> She LEAVES him standing there with Picard.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not understand, sir. Why...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You never ask a woman her age,<br>
    Mister Data.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Coming Of Age&quot; - 12/30/87 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>1A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am very confused, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Some customs will never change.</p>
  <p> TASHA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Acting Ensign Crusher, this is<br>
    the Transporter Room. We are<br>
    ready to beam you down to Relva 7.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (to the party)<br>
    Thanks for the party, everyone.<br>
    And the good wishes.</p>
  <p> They all RESPOND with &quot;Good luck;&quot; &quot;Go get 'em;&quot;<br>
    &quot;You'll do great.&quot;</p>
  <p> TASHA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (touching his<br>
    communicator)<br>
    Picard here.</p>
  <p> TASHA'S COM VOICE<br>
    We've received communication from<br>
    Relva 7 that Admiral Gregory Quinn<br>
    is about to beam aboard, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral Gregory Quinn. Why wasn't<br>
    I informed earlier, Lieutenant<br>
    Yar?</p>
  <p> TASHA'S COM VOICE<br>
    We just received the request, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard gestures to Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm on my way to the Transporter<br>
    Room, Lieutenant. Number One!</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker FOLLOW Wesley and Beverly OUT the<br>
    door.</p>

  <p>3 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Picard and Beverly say good-bye to Wesley.<br>
    Beverly reaches out to shake his hand, but Wesley leans<br>
    over and kisses her. He nods and Tasha works the<br>
    console and Wesley BEAMS DOWN to Relva 7. A beat, then<br>
    almost immediately, ADMIRAL GREGORY QUINN and<br>
    LIEUTENANT COMMANDER DEXTER REMMICK BEAM UP. Quinn is<br>
    a rugged man in his early sixties. He is accompanied<br>
    by Remmick, a young, blond, dedicated officer. They<br>
    step off the platform.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is unexpected. Welcome<br>
    aboard, Admiral.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Thank you. Captain Jean-Luc<br>
    Picard, Lieutenant Commander<br>
    Dexter Remmick.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    Sir.</p>
  <p> They shake hands, then Remmick steps back and watches.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Allow me to present my staff:<br>
    First Officer William Riker, Chief<br>
    Medical Officer Beverly Crusher,<br>
    chief of security, Lieutenant<br>
    Tasha Yar.</p>
  <p> Quinn nods to them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What can we do for you?</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    I need to speak with you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Certainly. This way. Number One.</p>
  <p> They turn to leave, as:</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    No. Alone.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is this personal?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Coming Of Age&quot; - 12/30/87 - TEASER 7.</p>

  <p> QUINN<br>
    Official business.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then my first officer...</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    ... Alone, Captain.</p>
  <p>This is unheard of. It's as if Riker's in big trouble<br>
    and no one knows why, as WE:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> as it orbits Relva 7.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V. O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 41416. 2.<br>
    We are orbiting Relva 7, one of<br>
    the testing sites where final<br>
    examinations are taking place for<br>
    entrance into Starfleet Academy.<br>
    But with the appearance of my old<br>
    colleague, Admiral Gregory Quinn,<br>
    our stay has taken on another<br>
    meaning.</p>
  <p>5 OMITTED</p>
  <p>5A INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard and Quinn ENTER. Remmick stands off to the<br>
    side.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Commander Remmick is with the<br>
    Inspector General's office.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh?</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    He'll be conducting a complete<br>
    investigation of the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What are you looking for?</p>
  <p> Quinn turns to especially include Remmick. Remmick<br>
    stands almost at attention.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    I have reason to believe there<br>
    may be something very wrong on<br>
    this ship... very wrong.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tell me what you suspect.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Coming Of Age&quot; - 12/30/87 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>5A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    No. It's... inappropriate to<br>
    discuss it now. We'll go over<br>
    it fully when Mister Remmick<br>
    concludes his investigation.<br>
    (turns to Remmick)<br>
    You will find out what is wrong<br>
    on this ship. Starfleet is<br>
    depending on you.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    Yes, sir.<br>
    (glances at Picard)<br>
    Nothing and no one will stand in<br>
    my way.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    And you, Captain, are ordered to<br>
    cooperate in every way necessary<br>
    with the investigation. Clear?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Mister Remmick, unless there are<br>
    further questions...</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    No questions, sir.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Get on with your duties.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    Yes, sir!</p>
  <p> Remmick purposefully EXITS. When the door CLOSES:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Greg, we've known each other for<br>
    years. If you weren't just<br>
    motivating young Mister Remmick, tell<br>
    me what you believe is wrong.</p>
  <p> Quinn dodges the question.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Captain, it is vitally important<br>
    that my orders are followed<br>
    exactly. I'll be staying on the<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Coming Of Age&quot; - 12/30/87 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>5A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As you wish, Admiral.</p>
  <p>6 EXT. RELVA 7 (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> ESTABLISHING the planet.</p>
  <p>7 INT. RELVA 7 - CLASSROOM</p>
  <p> Wesley is the first one to ARRIVE in the high-tech<br>
    classroom. He looks around the room uncomfortably.<br>
    There's an impressive array of DEVICES, including a<br>
    special SENSOR UNIT. He reaches down to inspect it,<br>
    but puts it back guiltily as OLIANA MIRREN ENTERS.<br>
    She's a gorgeous eighteen-year-old human, a red-head<br>
    with sparkle and probably a temper.</p>
  <p> OLIANA<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> OLIANA<br>
    The unit you just put down. Don't<br>
    worry. I won't tell anybody.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Oh. It's a flux coordinating<br>
    sensor.</p>
  <p> Oliana puts out her hand. Wesley takes it and<br>
    absentmindedly holds it. He's mesmerized by her.</p>
  <p> OLIANA<br>
    I'm Oliana Mirren, one of the<br>
    other finalists. You must be<br>
    Wesley Crusher.</p>
  <p> She gently removes her hand from his.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yeah! You know me?</p>
  <p> OLIANA<br>
    I heard there was a very smart,<br>
    very young man who'd be tough<br>
    competition.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Coming Of Age&quot; - 12/30/87 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (embarrassed)<br>
    Well, you wouldn't be here if...</p>
  <p> OLIANA<br>
    ... I weren't smart? I know. But<br>
    there's a lot more to it than<br>
    that. You're lucky - you've had<br>
    practical experience on the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> As she speaks, the door OPENS and T'SHANIK, a dark<br>
    young Vulcan woman, who looks as if she's surprised<br>
    anyone else bothered to show up, ENTERS with MORDOCK,<br>
    a powerfully built alien with a special suit using<br>
    circulating gas tubes. Mordock hangs back a little,<br>
    quietly.</p>
  <p> T'SHANIK<br>
    Oliana.<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    T'Shanik of Vulcana Regar.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Wesley Crusher, from the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> T'SHANIK<br>
    You don't look as if you meet the<br>
    age requirements.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Uh, I'll be sixteen next month.</p>
  <p> OLIANA<br>
    (pats him on the<br>
    shoulder)<br>
    Happy birthday. When this is all<br>
    over, we'll celebrate.</p>
  <p> Wesley basks in the thought of celebrating anything<br>
    with her, then realizes he's being rude. He turns to<br>
    Mordock.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Hi. I'm Wesley Crusher.</p>
  <p> Mordock nods and moves forward.</p>

    Mordock? The Mordock? The<br>
    Benzite who constructed the<br>
    Mordock Strategy? I thought you<br>
    already were in the Academy.</p>
  <p> MORDOCK<br>
    No. Only a hopeful, like you.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You're a legend in the Galactic<br>
    Computer Network...</p>

  <p> CHANG<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm TAC Officer Chang. Welcome.<br>
    You are here because you are all<br>
    top candidates. Although only<br>
    one student will be chosen for<br>
    the Academy, you have shown from<br>
    the preliminary testing that any<br>
    of you could easily qualify.<br>
    (makes eye contact with<br>
    each)<br>
    We are looking for the person who<br>
    combines all the important<br>
    qualities necessary to be part<br>
    of Starfleet's future. Integrity,<br>
    intelligence, courage,<br>
    imagination... and that<br>
    indefinable quality of leadership.<br>
    This may be the most difficult,<br>
    exhausting experience of your<br>
    life. And the most exciting<br>
    challenge. Expect the<br>
    unexpected... May you all do your<br>
    best... Now, we'll begin.</p>
  <p> Chang LEAVES the room as the computers LIGHT UP. The<br>
    four students immediately start the test. And the<br>
    faster they answer the questions, the faster the<br>
    computer asks them.</p>

  <p> They're all pounding away at extreme high speeds, but<br>
    with different kinds of energy, and each time they take<br>
    a test they'll respond with the same kind of energy.</p>
  <p> Wesley concentrates completely and works at an<br>
    incredibly fast, even pace.</p>
  <p> T'Shanik works quickly, calmly and methodically.</p>
  <p> Mordock, with great intensity.</p>
  <p> Oliana, alternates bursts of energy with quiet. The<br>

  <p> Riker commands the bridge, with Data and Geordi, Tasha<br>
    and Worf at their regular stations. Remmick stands<br>
    over Data, just watching him sit there. Remmick HOLDS<br>
    A HAND DEVICE which he will carry with him everywhere<br>
    -- A MINIATURE PERSONAL COMPUTER where he punches in<br>
    every observation. Riker watches him without saying a<br>
    word.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    May I help you, Mister Remmick?</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    Just keep on doing whatever it<br>
    is you're doing, Commander Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Data continues staring, as Remmick moves over to<br>
    Geordi.. and stands over him, making entries in his<br>
    computer.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There's nothing much to see here,<br>
    Commander. We're in standard<br>
    orbit. And, uh, the station has<br>
    to be manned, even if it's<br>
    routine...</p>

    When I'm ready, Mister Riker, I'll<br>
    want to speak with you.<br>
    Privately.</p>
  <p> Remmick moves aft, to stand next to Worf. Remmick<br>
    watches Worf work at his console and makes more notes.<br>
    Worf pretends he's not there. Geordi turns to Data.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Just having that guy around makes<br>
    me feel guilty.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Commander, what's this guy after?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't know, Geordi. But I'm<br>
    going to find out. Now.</p>

  <p> Riker ENTERS, and sits down as the Captain motions him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, may I speak frankly?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Always, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    As executive officer, I should<br>
    be informed. I should know<br>
    everything you know.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I agree. You should.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's this about? Remmick is<br>
    going to turn this ship upside<br>
    down.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That is his job.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And mine is to make sure the ship<br>
    runs smoothly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Which you do very well.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sir, am I under investigation?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And if you did?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I couldn't tell you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't understand, sir. This<br>
    is extremely frustrating.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No less so for me. But I have<br>
    promised full cooperation. And<br>
    we shall give it.</p>
  <p> Riker tries not to lose his temper.</p>

    antimatter tanks on a Galaxy Class<br>
    starship are nine-tenths depleted,<br>
    calculate the intermix ratio<br>
    necessary to reach a starbase a<br>
    hundred light years away at warp<br>

  <p> All the students begin to use the calculators attached<br>
    to the computer, except Wesley, who immediately punches<br>
    in the answer. T'Shanik reaches the answer almost<br>
    immediately. Mordock, driven and intense, is startled<br>
    at their speed, then pushes in his answer. Oliana<br>
    finishes last.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>

    Thank you, students. You now have<br>
    one hour free before the next<br>

  <p> The computer shuts down, its lights FADE OUT. T'Shanik<br>
    EXITS the classroom immediately as Wesley, Oliana and<br>
    Mordock relax.</p>
  <p> MORDOCK<br>
    I admit, Wesley, you have a very<br>
    fast mind.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    As soon as I realized it was a<br>
    trick question, there was only<br>
    one answer.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Coming of Age&quot; - 12/30/87 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MORDOCK<br>
    Yes. There is only one &quot;ratio&quot;<br>
    with matter-antimatter. One to<br>
    one.</p>
  <p> Wesley sneaks a look at Oliana. Her jaw is set, then<br>
    she shrugs and smiles her bright smile at the two of<br>
    the them.</p>
  <p> OLIANA<br>
    You're both very lucky. I can't<br>
    imagine what it feels like to have<br>
    things come so easily. I have<br>
    to push every step of the way.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Oh, no, Oliana, it doesn't come<br>
    easily. I have to study all the<br>
    time. Mordock's the one who's<br>
    brilliant.</p>
  <p> OLIANA<br>
    You really don't know, do you?<br>
    It's a good thing you're cute,<br>
    Wesley, or you could really be<br>
    obnoxious.</p>
  <p> She pushes her chair back and gets up.</p>
  <p> OLIANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    See you later.</p>
  <p> She LEAVES the room.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Did you hear that Mordock? She<br>
    said I was cute!</p>
  <p> MORDOCK<br>
    Is that good, Wesley?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I don't know. I think so. Maybe.<br>
    I don't know.</p>
  <p> MORDOCK<br>
    Perhaps I was incorrect about the<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, I think I should<br>
    apologize.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No need, Number One. Mister<br>
    Remmick's presence is unnerving,<br>
    to say the least.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Regardless, sir, I should realize<br>
    that whatever your reasons are,<br>
    they're valid. Whether or not<br>
    I understand them.</p>
  <p> Remmick ENTERS the bridge.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    Are you available now, Mister Riker?<br>
    Or do you still have duties to<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm available, Mister Remmick.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    Any problem with using your Ready<br>

  <p> The crew considers this an intrusion.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    I'll find him a comfortable place<br>
    on Deck Fifteen, sir.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    It's more convenient here. Is<br>
    there a problem, Captain?</p>

  <p> Riker is surprised -- he thought he was the one on the<br>
    hot seat, but it's Picard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The captain's log?</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    Yes. To your knowledge, has the<br>
    captain ever falsified a log?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Have you discussed this with him?</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    Right now, I'm asking you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If you want to discuss anything<br>
    about Captain Picard, bring him<br>
    in here and ask him face to face.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    You are required to answer my<br>
    questions, Mister Riker. Unless<br>
    you're trying to cover something<br>
    up? Now, there are several<br>

  <p>19A INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM (FORMERLY SCENE 16A)</p>
  <p> Troi calmly faces Remmick.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    Do you believe the captain is<br>
    emotionally and psychologically<br>
    fit for command of this starship?<br>
    There is nothing in his history<br>
    or his personality that might<br>
    suggest... mental lapses?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Nothing.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    Not even the Ferengi incident with<br>
    his old ship, the Stargazer?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He was being controlled by a<br>
    mind-altering machine, Commander.<br>
    Without his knowledge.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    I would say that was a mental<br>
    lapse.</p>
  <p>20 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Geordi is working on a panel as Remmick questions him.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    So, you are saying Captain Picard<br>
    had no control over this vessel.<br>
    He handed it over to Kosinski,<br>
    who took the entire crew to some<br>
    sort of &quot;alternate&quot; universe.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No, sir. That's not what I'm<br>
    saying. Kosinski was sent by<br>
    Starfleet to improve our warp<br>
    drive. The captain was ordered<br>
    to take him aboard.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    According to his own logs, the<br>
    bridge crew didn't think highly<br>
    of Mister Kosinski's theories, yet<br>
    the captain allowed him access<br>
    to the engines anyway. Is that<br>
    true, La Forge?</p>

  <p> REMMICK<br>
    One way or the other, La Forge,<br>
    Picard lost control of this ship.<br>
    Is that true?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, but that's not how it<br>
    happened.</p>

    Okay. So far. It's not the ones<br>

    Psych Test is no more or less<br>
    important than the rest of the<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    That's what they said, but it's<br>
    all I can think about.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Thinking about what you can't<br>
    control simply wastes your energy<br>
    and creates its own fear.</p>

    fear is when I don't?</p>

    Very... original, Captain. But<br>
    how did this child gain access<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Kurland is a highly qualified<br>

  <p> REMMICK<br>
    And did this &quot;full&quot; training<br>
    include discipline?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Young men sometimes make rash<br>

    office. He's telling her what her point standing is<br>
    in relation to the other candidates. Chang ENTERS<br>
    his office, leaving her there looking dejected.</p>

  <p> OLIANA<br>
    Oh. Hi, Wes.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I, um, thought you might want to<br>
    have lunch... together.</p>
  <p> OLIANA<br>
    Thanks, but I'm not very hungry.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Oh... okay.</p>
  <p> She pats him on the hand.</p>
  <p> OLIANA<br>
    It's not you... it's just that<br>
    Mordock and you are so far ahead<br>
    in points, I'll never catch up.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Oh. Sorry.<br>
    (worried)<br>
    You're not leaving., are you?</p>
  <p> OLIANA<br>
    And give up? Never. Besides,<br>
    it'll be good practice for next<br>
    year. See you later.</p>
  <p> She's almost back to her cheerful self. Wesley stares<br>
    after her thoughtfully, then turns around, almost<br>
    bumping into Mordock.</p>
  <p> MORDOCK<br>
    Ah, Wesley. Distracted by the<br>
    female human again. No matter.<br>
    It does not seem to diminish your<br>
    mental faculties. You do good<br>
    work.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Me? No, you're the one. I've<br>
    studied the Mordock Strategy...</p>
  <p> MORDOCK<br>
    Are you a player of Benzite chess?</p>

    If you like, we can discuss this<br>
    at lunch... I am hungry.</p>
  <p> Wesley cheers up.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Me too!</p>
  <p> They start towards the Mess Hall. RONDON, an<br>
    irritable, powerful-looking Alien, WALKS TOWARDS them<br>
    with a package under his arm.</p>
  <p> RONDON<br>

    You. I have a package for<br>
    Operations. Where is it?</p>

  <p> CHANG<br>
    Is there a problem here,<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No, sir... I, he...</p>

    straightforward. He advances towards Rondon.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Who do you think you're bullying?<br>
    You bumped into me. It was your<br>
    mistake. You were rude.<br>
    (assuming defense<br>
    posture)<br>
    Do you want this to become<br>
    violent?</p>
  <p> Mordock moves to separate them, but Chang motions him<br>
    back, as Wesley holds his ground. Abruptly, Rondon<br>
    warmly pats Wesley on the Back.</p>
  <p> RONDON<br>
    Friend. I like you.</p>
  <p> He turns and is GONE. Mordock is confused.</p>
  <p> MORDOCK<br>
    A very strange reaction.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Not really. When he held up his<br>
    hand, I could see it was<br>
    webbed... the sign of a Zaldan.</p>
  <p> CHANG<br>
    But you became hostile.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Zaldans are infuriated by<br>
    courtesy. They see it as a form<br>
    of phony social behavior, designed<br>
    to hide real feelings.</p>
  <p> CHANG<br>
    Congratulations, Mister Crusher.<br>
    You handled that particular<br>
    incident very well.</p>
  <p> Mordock is alerted.</p>
  <p> MORDOCK<br>
    Was that &quot;incident&quot; deliberate?</p>

    to be.</p>
  <p> He smiles and LEAVES.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    And as an android, you are<br>
    programmed to tell the entire<br>
    truth?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    There is a problem with this ship,<br>
    Mister Data. It's in the records,<br>
    somewhere. I need your help to<br>
    find it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    All the ship's records are<br>
    available to you, sir.</p>

  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    This information is very cleverly<br>
    hidden. Your captain is not what<br>
    he appears to be. Do not forget<br>
    you have loyalty to Starfleet<br>
    above all else.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Loyalty is not the issue,<br>
    Commander. There is nothing wrong<br>
    with Captain Picard -- or the<br>
    ship's logs. Therefore there must<br>
    be something wrong with your<br>
    original assumption.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    That is not acceptable, Mister Data.</p>

  <p> Remmick leans in towards her.</p>

    Yes. It's exactly as I explained<br>
    it in the log records.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>

    COLORS and PATTERNS, SPINNING in a space, ROTATING<br>
    along their axes, and REAPPEARING with DIFFERENT<br>

  <p> CHANG<br>
    Congratulations, Mordock. That<br>
    was the second fastest time<br>
    recorded on this test. You all<br>
    did well.</p>
  <p> MORDOCK<br>
    It should not have been that way.<br>
    Mister Crusher helped me.</p>
  <p> CHANG<br>
    Yes. I know. An interesting<br>
    choice, Mister Crusher. Especially<br>
    considering how close you and Mister<br>
    Mordock are in overall score.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> CHANG<br>
    You all have an hour to prepare<br>
    for your last test.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    The Psych Test, sir?</p>
  <p> CHANG<br>
    We prefer to think of it as a<br>
    psychological evaluation based<br>
    on reactions to various individual<br>
    problems.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    But the Psych Test will do.</p>

  <p> Remmick ENTERS.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    Sir.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Please sit down, Mister Remmick.<br>
    Proceed with your report.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Coming Of Age&quot; - 12/30/87 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard is intent, ready and willing to hear Remmick's<br>
    findings. Remmick is very uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    Admiral, I've done my best to be<br>
    objective during this<br>
    investigation. And yet, I feel<br>
    a sense of failure.</p>
  <p> He hesitates.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Continue.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    I couldn't find what you asked,<br>
    sir. I spoke with officer after<br>
    officer, at length. I probed the<br>
    log reports. And I have found<br>
    nothing wrong. Except, perhaps,<br>
    a casual familiarity among the<br>
    bridge crew, but... mostly that<br>
    comes from a sense of teamwork.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm sorry, sir. I did my best.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Quite. You're dismissed,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> He gets up to leave, and pauses at the door.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Captain Picard, my tour in the<br>
    Inspector General's office will<br>
    be up in six months. When I'm<br>
    finished, this is where I'd like<br>
    to serve, sir.</p>
  <p> He nods and LEAVES. Picard looks at Quinn.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Don't judge the young man too<br>
    harshly. He's a good officer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's not him I'm judging.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Coming Of Age&quot; - 12/30/87 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Don't judge me too harshly,<br>
    either. Not until I'm finished.<br>
    We had to be very sure about you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Some time ago, a few of us in<br>
    Starfleet Command became<br>
    suspicious of problems within<br>
    the Federation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What kind of problems?</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Something or someone is trying<br>
    to destroy the fabric of all we've<br>
    built over the last two hundred<br>
    years.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's your evidence?</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    I can't go into that. Too many<br>
    other people are involved. But<br>
    if we're right, this is the most<br>
    critical time in the history of<br>
    the Federation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What do you want from me?</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    I don't know if the threat is<br>
    coming from within or from the<br>
    outside. I need people I can trust<br>
    in strong positions throughout<br>
    the Federation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You have my complete support.<br>
    You know that.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Not enough. I want to promote<br>
    you to admiral, Jean-Luc. I want<br>
    you to take over as Commandant<br>
    of Starfleet Academy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Academy?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Coming Of Age&quot; - 12/30/87 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Yes. I need you close.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then there was never a problem<br>
    with the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    No. I had to be sure you hadn't<br>
    been co-opted.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Greg, the real issue is politics.<br>
    I'm no good at politics. Surely<br>
    there are others more suited.</p>
  <p> Picard isn't sure how to take all of this.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    I sense you're doubtful about<br>
    this. All right. Suppose it's<br>
    the rambling paranoia of an old<br>
    man. Even if I am wrong, and I<br>
    hope I am, you're still the best<br>
    man for the job.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I appreciate the value of what<br>
    you're offering. It's not<br>
    something I can decide quickly.</p>
  <p> Quinn pushes him.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    I need your answer soon, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right. You'll have it<br>
    tonight, Admiral.</p>
  <p> As they shake hands, WE</p>

  <p>51 INT. RELVA 7 - CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Wesley sits nervously waiting outside the Testing Room.<br>
    He closes his eyes and tries to do breathing exercises<br>
    to keep himself calm. Chang COMES OUT of the Testing<br>
    Room.</p>
  <p> CHANG<br>
    Mister Mordock will be finished with<br>
    his Psych Test momentarily.</p>
  <p> Wesley watches the door, waiting. It slides OPEN, but<br>
    no one is there. Then... Mordock EMERGES, badly<br>
    shaken, his face covered with sweat. He looks down<br>
    at his hands.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Mordock? Are you... all right?</p>
  <p> Mordock tries not to scare Wesley.</p>
  <p> MORDOCK<br>
    I will be...</p>
  <p> CHANG<br>
    Mister Crusher... you're next. Good<br>
    luck.</p>
  <p> Chang gestures for Wesley to enter. Wesley hesitates,<br>
    then STEPS THROUGH. The door slides SHUT behind him.</p>
  <p>52 OMITTED</p>
  <p>53 INT. RELVA 7 - TESTING ROOM</p>
  <p> An ordinary room. White walls, two or three chairs, no<br>
    windows. Wesley looks around for some guidance as to<br>
    the next step. He waits a beat, then looks around and<br>
    decides to sit down. Still nothing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Coming Of Age&quot; - 12/30/87 - ACT FIVE 47.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Hello?</p>
  <p> He gets up and starts to pace.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm here. I'm, uh, ready.</p>
  <p> Nothing. He sits down again.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing; muttering)<br>
    Maybe they forgot.</p>
  <p> Wesley jumps up again and resumes pacing.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Breathe. Gotta remember to<br>
    breathe.</p>
  <p> He's startled by something -- a sound, a sense of<br>
    something wrong. He becomes alert, checking out the<br>
    room. He takes another deep breath, then realizes he<br>
    hears something in the distance -- MUFFLED THUD. He<br>
    moves towards the door he entered. He listens intently<br>
    near the door, and hears a LOUDER NOISE. Wesley opens<br>
    the door manually and ENTERS the corridor.</p>
  <p>54 INT. RELVA 7 - LONG CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Several more O.S. EXPLOSIONS. Wesley runs towards its<br>
    source. He reaches a door and hears ALARMS RINGING<br>
    and another EXPLOSION. The door says: &quot;ENVIRONMENTAL<br>
    MAINTENANCE LABORATORY.&quot; He runs down the empty<br>
    corridor and YELLS.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Somebody help! Something's wrong<br>
    in the lab!</p>
  <p> There is no response. Then he hears:</p>
  <p> TECHNICIAN #1 (V.O.)<br>
    Help! We're trapped. Help!<br>
    We're gonna die.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)<br>
    Evacuate immediately. Sixty-five<br>
    seconds to life-support seal-off.</p>
  <p> Wesley presses the wallplate and the door GLIDES OPEN.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Coming Of Age&quot; - 12/30/87 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p>55 INT. RELVA 7 - ENVIRONMENTAL LAB</p>
  <p> Wesley ENTERS cautiously. The door CLOSES behind him.<br>
    WIND HOWLS through the room, which has been partially<br>
    trashed by the explosions. It's FREEZING. A large<br>
    pipe has fractured, allowing fumes of liquid hydrogen<br>
    (or another gas) and a vortex of wind to act as a barrier<br>
    between Wesley and the TWO TECHNICIANS.</p>
  <p> TECHNICIAN #1 is cowered in a corner, uninjured,<br>
    YELLING, on the other side of the wind tunnel. His<br>
    pathway out is partially blocked by debris, so he must<br>
    cross the vortex to get to the door.</p>
  <p> TECHNICIAN #2, is trapped, under a piece of equipment<br>
    on the far side of the vortex, not far from Technician<br>
    #1.</p>
  <p> Wesley hesitates, then makes his way ACROSS the HOWLING<br>
    WIND to the injured Technician. The WIND and COLD<br>
    continue to batter the two of them.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Evacuate immediately. Forty-five<br>
    seconds to life-support seal-off.</p>
  <p> Wesley tries to move the equipment off the trapped<br>
    man.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (to Technician #1)<br>
    Help me move this!</p>
  <p> The Technician remains cowered in the corner, shaking<br>
    his head. Wesley keeps pushing the equipment.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You have to help me!</p>
  <p> TECHNICIAN #1<br>
    I can't! It's too late. We're<br>
    going to die! The liquid<br>
    hydrogen's gonna blow!</p>
  <p> TECHNICIAN #2<br>
    Please don't leave me! The<br>
    shut-off valve ruptured. If we<br>
    don't get out of here fast,<br>
    they'll seal us off to contain<br>
    the explosion!</p>

  <p>55 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Evacuate immediately. Twenty-five<br>
    seconds to seal-off.</p>
  <p> Wesley finds something to use as a lever. The<br>
    equipment begins to move slightly. Beads of sweat pour<br>
    off Wesley's face as he makes a Herculean last effort.<br>
    Technician #2's leg is free. Wesley drags him out.<br>
    He turns to Technician #1.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Come on!</p>
  <p> TECHNICIAN #1<br>
    There's no way out! I can't move<br>
    through that!</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You have to. I can't carry you<br>
    both! You can walk. Come on.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Evacuate immediately. Five<br>
    seconds to seal-off.</p>
  <p> Technician #1 remains terrified in the corner. Wesley<br>
    hesitates a moment, then half-carries, half-drags<br>
    Technician #2 through the vortex towards the exit.<br>
    He looks back:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> Wesley pulls Technician #2 THROUGH THE DOOR to the<br>
    corridor.</p>
  <p>56 INT. RELVA 7 - CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Wesley pulls Technician #2 THROUGH THE DOOR INTO the<br>
    corridor. The door SNAPS SHUT behind him. Chang is<br>
    standing there, waiting. Wesley's heart is pounding,<br>
    his adrenaline up.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Officer Chang! There's been an...</p>
  <p> CHANG<br>
    It's all right, Wesley.</p>
  <p> The &quot;injured&quot; Technician gets up, brushes himself off,<br>
    and shakes Wesley's hand. Wesley's shocked.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Coming Of Age&quot; - 12/30/87 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>56 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TECHNICIAN #2<br>
    Thanks.</p>
  <p> He WALKS down the corridor, leaving Wesley with Chang.<br>
    Wesley's still pale and breathing shallowly, when<br>
    Technician #1 EXITS the Lab, nods to them both, and<br>
    FOLLOWS the other Technician.</p>
  <p> CHANG.<br>
    Excellent performance, Mister<br>
    Crusher.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Performance?!... That was the test.</p>
  <p> CHANG<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But a man died!</p>
  <p> CHANG<br>
    Theoretically, yes. You had to<br>
    make a choice. And you did.<br>
    There's no right or wrong about<br>
    it. Your greatest fear has been<br>
    that you couldn't make that<br>
    decision.</p>
  <p> Wesley just looks at him, and nods his head slowly.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Because of my father? Because<br>
    Cap... someone made that choice<br>
    and my father died.</p>
  <p> Chang smiles and pats Wesley on the shoulder.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Remmick has left the ship.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. He found nothing wrong on<br>
    the Enterprise. You may inform<br>
    the crew that Admiral Quinn is<br>
    most impressed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you. They'll be pleased...<br>
    Can you explain now what he was<br>
    after?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They were after me, Number One.<br>
    They want me to take over as<br>
    Commandant of Starfleet Academy.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Congratulations! What a wonderful<br>
    choice, sir! You'll be able to<br>
    shape the minds of the future<br>
    leaders of Starfleet.</p>
  <p> He looks at Picard, realizes his ambivalence.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You haven't decided what you're<br>
    going to do.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p>60 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> CHANG<br>
    I'm proud of all of you. You've<br>
    done a superb job. Each of you<br>
    would make a fine Starfleet<br>
    officer. It's unfair that only<br>
    one candidate from Relva will<br>
    attend the Academy this year --<br>
    and a loss to the Federation if<br>
    the rest of you do not return to<br>
    test again... Mister Mordock will<br>
    be the candidate. His results<br>
    were slightly higher than Mister<br>
    Crusher's. Congratulations, Mister<br>
    Mordock. You are the first<br>
    Benzite in Starfleet.</p>
  <p> Wesley slumps in his seat. Mordock looks at all of<br>
    them, then turns to Chang.</p>
  <p> MORDOCK<br>
    Thank you, sir, but it's not<br>
    right. It shouldn't be me.<br>
    Wesley lost points because he<br>
    helped me. He shouldn't be<br>
    punished for his generosity.</p>
  <p> CHANG<br>
    He wasn't. He lost time, but<br>
    it wasn't only that...<br>
    Candidates, thank you and good<br>
    luck.</p>
  <p> They all stand as Chang EXITS.</p>
  <p> MORDOCK<br>
    I am sorry, Wesley.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's okay. You deserved to win.<br>
    Besides, you would've done the<br>
    same thing for me.</p>
  <p> They all look questioningly at Mordock, who hesitates.<br>
    Then he looks at his comrades:</p>
  <p> MORDOCK<br>
    Yes. I believe I would.</p>
  <p> T'Shanik APPROACHES Mordock.</p>

  <p> OLIANA<br>
    Well, personally, I hate losing.<br>
    So you'd better be ready next<br>

  <p> JAKE<br>

  <p> Picard is uncomfortable around him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you... feeling better?</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    Yes, sir... I'm sorry I damaged<br>
    the shuttle. But Mister Riker says<br>
    I can work on fixing it as part<br>
    of my &quot;discipline&quot; training.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good idea. I hope you learned<br>
    that running away doesn't solve<br>
    anything, young man.</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    Yes, sir. I'm sorry I messed up.</p>

    No, sir. And... thank you for<br>
    saving my life.</p>

    your dress uniform for Admiral<br>
    Quinn's farewell dinner?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I... I didn't think it would be<br>
    appropriate.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why not?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I failed, Captain. I didn't get<br>
    into the Academy. I failed you...<br>
    and the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ridiculous. Did you do your best?</p>
  <p> A beat. Wesley nods.</p>

    improve?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Well, yes...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good. The only person you're<br>
    truly competing against is<br>
    yourself.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Then you're not disappointed?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your failures and successes have<br>
    to be measured within, Wesley.<br>
    Not by me or anyone else... But<br>
    if it helps you to know this, I<br>
    failed my first time. And you<br>
    may not tell anyone!</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You? You failed?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. But not the second time.<br>
    Now, do me the honor of sitting<br>
    next to me at dinner. I'm going<br>

  <p> QUINN<br>
    This is where you belong.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you need me...</p>
  <p> Quinn brushes aside Picard's concern.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    I've been playing politics too<br>
    long. Perhaps I see conspiracy<br>
    everywhere. Don't worry.</p>
  <p> Quinn shakes Picard's hand and then steps onto the<br>
    platform.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Safe travels, my friend.</p>
  <p> Quinn nods to Tasha, who works the console. Picard<br>
    stares at Quinn for a long time, as if memorizing what<br>
    he looks like. The admiral is BEAMED DOWN.</p>
  <p>65B INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard STEPS OFF the turbolift. He walks to where<br>
    Wesley sits at the Conn, and stands between Wesley and<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Set course to Algeron 4, Mister<br>
    Crusher.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Course plotted and laid in, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You know, we're really alike, you<br>
    and I. Both explorers to the<br>
    core... Engage, Mister Crusher.</p>
  <p> Wesley smiles happily at Picard's praise.</p>
  <p>66 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> moves off to its next destination, as WE:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE <br>
    THE END </p>
