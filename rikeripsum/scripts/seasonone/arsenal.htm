  <p> TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> It's moving through sparkling, black velvet space -- a<br>
    blue-green planet slowly enlarging in the distant<br>
    background.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V. O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 41798.2.<br>
    We are ordered by Starfleet, to<br>
    proceed to the Lorenze Cluster<br>
    and investigate the disappearance<br>
    of the light cruiser USS Drake,<br>
    which was in that system trying<br>
    to unravel a mystery of its own.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> EVERYONE's at station except Riker and Troi. Riker's<br>
    at the Aft Station going over some computer readouts.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Recent long range probes indicate<br>
    that all intelligent life on the<br>
    planet Minos has disappeared.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No help from their communications<br>
    log. The Drake reported<br>
    arriving at Minos and was never<br>
    heard from again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The citizens of Minos gained fame<br>
    during the Ersalrope wars as<br>
    arms merchants. They manufactured<br>
    sophisticated and highly advanced<br>
    weaponry.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Arsenal... &quot; - 1/25/88 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    For which side?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Both.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We are nearing the planet Minos.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Standard orbit, Mister La Forge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir. Standard orbit.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Whatever happened to the Drake,<br>
    happened quickly, otherwise<br>
    Captain Rice would have sent<br>
    another message.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You know Captain Rice?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We were at the Academy together.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tell me about him.</p>
  <p> Troi listens intently.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Able. A good officer.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How would he react under stress?</p>
  <p> Riker thinks for a beat, then:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Paul Rice is confident almost to<br>
    the point of arrogance, but<br>
    carries it well because he usually<br>
    makes the right choices. He's<br>
    a risk taker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Arsenal... &quot; - 1/25/88 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll give you an example. One<br>
    of the final tests in advance<br>
    navigation at the Academy presents<br>
    the student with three options.<br>
    When Rice took the test, he<br>
    rejected all of them and offered<br>
    one of his own.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'd call that arrogant.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But it paid off -- he received the<br>
    top mark. And now that test has<br>
    four options. The original<br>
    three... plus his.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    In a difficult situation a man<br>
    like that would react aggressively.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Agreed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One, weren't you offered<br>
    the Drake?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    You turned down your own command<br>
    to take this assignment?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    At the time, I thought it was<br>
    more advantageous for me to do<br>
    a tour on the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain -- readings correspond<br>
    with the findings of the probe. <br>
    No signs of intelligent life-forms.<br>
    Vegetation and animal life only.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    None?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Correct.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Arsenal... &quot; - 1/25/88 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What happened to all those people?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    War?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Disease?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    A dissatisfied customer?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    In any war, natural disaster, or<br>
    even the most virulent plague,<br>
    there are always survivors.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, we are being hailed.</p>
  <p>2A EVERYONE REACTS</p>
  <p> The question on their faces.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How is that possible from a planet<br>
    with no people?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your sensors indicated no<br>
    intelligent life?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Correct.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Put it on the Main Viewer.</p>
  <p>3 ANGLE TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A humanoid, THE PEDDLER, APPEARS on the Main Viewer.<br>
    He has a ROLLING, LILTING VOICE, the confidence of a<br>
    master salesman with a touch of the carny thrown in.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Arsenal... &quot; - 1/25/88 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> THE PEDDLER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Whoever you are -- wherever you're<br>
    from -- greetings and welcome to<br>
    Minos -- the Arsenal of Freedom...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of<br>
    the USS Enterprise. To whom am<br>
    I speaking?</p>
  <p> The Peddler ignores the question and continues with his<br>
    pitch.</p>
  <p> THE PEDDLER'S COM VOICE<br>
    ... Where we live by the motto --<br>
    peace through superior firepower.<br>
    Come -- allow us to meet your<br>
    needs. If you need a little<br>
    something special, be it for one<br>
    target -- or multiple targets -- we<br>
    got it, you'll see it... here on<br>
    the Arsenal of Freedom. Because<br>
    we don't just provide weapons --<br>
    we also offer complete weapon<br>
    systems.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is a recorded message.</p>
  <p> THE PEDDLER'S COM VOICE<br>
    To be totally armed is to be<br>
    totally secure...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It must be left over from the time<br>
    of the Romulan wars, when the<br>
    business of selling arms was<br>
    booming.</p>
  <p> THE PEDDLER'S COM VOICE<br>
    ... Remember, the early bird that<br>
    hesitates gets wormed. Perfection<br>
    in highly-advanced weaponry.<br>
    Versatility... flexibility.<br>
    And... everything one hundred<br>
    percent guaranteed... So lock on<br>
    to my signal and beam on down.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Screen off.</p>
  <p> The screen GOES OFF.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Arsenal... &quot; - 1/25/88 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's a heck of a sales pitch.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If an automated message system<br>
    is still functioning -- other<br>
    systems on the planet may also<br>
    be operational.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Weapons systems?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Possibly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We are going to have to go down<br>
    there to find it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Prepare your away team, Number<br>
    One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lieutenant Yar -- Commander Data.</p>
  <p> Data rises from his chair and is immediately replaced<br>
    by LIEUTENANT (J. G.) ORFIL SOLIS.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Commander, I recommend a minimum<br>
    complement.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Oh? I would have thought<br>
    otherwise.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    We'll keep the first landing party<br>
    small and mobile. Until I'm<br>
    confident that whatever killed<br>
    the inhabitants of this planet<br>
    isn't still down there.</p>
  <p> Riker nods his agreement. And they head for the<br>
    turbolift.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>6 EXT. PLANET SURFACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> It's a small clearing in a verdant, overgrown area.<br>
    Riker, Data and Tasha BEAM IN, and stand apprehensively<br>
    looking around. The SOUNDS OF LIFE -- BIRDS, INSECTS --<br>
    surround them. The away team stands quietly, looking<br>
    around tensely, and then slowly turning on their<br>
    tricorders and scanning the periphery, protecting each<br>
    other with their backs together.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Spooky.<br>
    (touches com)<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Bridge. Captain speaking.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'll start a pattern search<br>
    from this point.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Keep this channel open.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander, our communications are<br>
    being monitored.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    By whom?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, since there is no intelligent<br>
    life, the question is &quot;by what?&quot;</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p>7 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard in his Command position listening to the away<br>
    team.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Arsenal... &quot; - 1/25/88 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, I heard, Number One. We'll<br>
    try to track it down from here.</p>
  <p> Worf and the others strain over their instruments.</p>
  <p>8 EXT. PLANET SURFACE</p>
  <p> The team moves slowly down the clearing, very alert,<br>
    and OUT OF SHOT.</p>
  <p>9 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - RUINS</p>
  <p> Crumbled high-tech ruins, aged and rusted in spots.<br>
    The team ENTERS SHOT, Tasha leading. Near the base<br>
    of a ruin she pulls away some foliage and a melted rod<br>
    and plank of tritanium ARE SEEN.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Tritanium. It's been melted.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What could do that?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Whatever it was, it's beyond our<br>
    technology.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Over here.</p>
  <p> Data has found something. Its shape is clearly that<br>
    of a weapon: a super-high-tech RIFLE, gimbal-mounted,<br>
    with laser rheostats and sighting. Riker kneels,<br>
    scans, and examines it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've never even seen anything<br>
    like this.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    It's undamaged.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe a demonstration model for<br>
    some potential buyer.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Maybe. Let's spread out a<br>
    little.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Arsenal... &quot; - 1/25/88 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>10 INTERCUT</p>
  <p> The away team as it SPREADS OUT.</p>
  <p>11 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard listening to the SOUNDS OF THEM MOVING THROUGH<br>
    THE UNDERBRUSH.</p>
  <p> SOLIS<br>
    Commander Riker. This is<br>
    Lieutenant Solis. I am<br>
    monitoring a slight energy<br>
    buildup near your position.<br>
    I am not able to pinpoint the<br>
    source.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Give me a direction.</p>
  <p> SOLIS<br>
    East of your position -- ten<br>
    meters. I will continue<br>
    monitoring.</p>
  <p>12 EXT. PLANET SURFACE</p>
  <p> ON Riker -- as he looks through the foliage.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can't see anything from here.<br>
    The underbrush is very thick.</p>
  <p> He goes behind the ruin to examine the back side of<br>
    it. Suddenly he tenses, sensing something.</p>
  <p> RICE (O.S.)<br>
    Hello... Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> Riker turns at the sound of the voice. CAPTAIN PAUL<br>
    RICE STEPS INTO SHOT. He is dressed in a Starfleet<br>
    Captain's uniform, trim and neat, a man of Riker's age<br>
    with a military bearing. He is businesslike and calm,<br>
    and acts as if this kind of meeting, under these<br>
    circumstances, is perfectly normal. Riker, on the<br>
    other hand, is stunned.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Arsenal... &quot; - 1/25/88 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Rice! Where did you come from?</p>
  <p> RICE<br>
    I was over there.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You had us worried. But, I should<br>
    have known you'd pop up.</p>
  <p> RICE<br>
    How are you, Commander Riker?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Me -- never mind me. How are you?<br>
    No word, no message... nothing.</p>
  <p> RICE<br>
    How many are with you?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Two others. Where's the<br>
    Drake? Where's your crew?</p>
  <p>13 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (INTERCUT WITH PLANET AS NEEDED)</p>
  <p> Picard is as surprised as Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's going on Number One?</p>
  <p> Riker STEPS AWAY, so the following conversation is<br>
    confidential.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's Paul Rice from the Drake.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (confused by the apparent<br>
    contradiction)<br>
    Lieutenant Solis?</p>
  <p> SOLIS<br>
    Sensors indicate low level energy<br>
    readings, but the only life signs<br>
    are the away team.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Careful, Number One.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Arsenal... &quot; - 1/25/88 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Understood.</p>
  <p>13A EXT. PLANET SURFACE</p>
  <p> Riker MOVES BACK TO Rice.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Rice)<br>
    You look strange, Paul...</p>
  <p> RICE<br>
    I was injured getting here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you need medical help?</p>
  <p> Riker is very suspicious and ready for anything. He<br>
    knows this image in front of him is NOT Captain Paul<br>
    Rice, but in order to find out the purpose of this<br>
    replica he will play along.</p>
  <p> RICE<br>
    No. What is your purpose here?</p>
  <p> Tasha and Data join Riker. They stare at Rice, who<br>
    hardly notices them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is Commander Data and<br>
    Lieutenant Yar.</p>
  <p> Data looks down at his tricorder, then back to the<br>
    figure.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Other than ourselves, sir, I am<br>
    picking up no other life signs<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes. I know.</p>
  <p> RICE<br>
    Riker, you didn't answer me. Who<br>
    sent you here to look for me?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Your mother.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Arsenal... &quot; - 1/25/88 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>13A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Both Tasha and Data REACT to this obvious lie.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    She's worried about you.</p>
  <p> RICE<br>
    Tell me about your ship -- the<br>
    Enterprise, isn't it?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No... The name of my ship is the<br>
    Lollipop.</p>
  <p> RICE<br>
    I have no knowledge of that ship.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's just been commissioned. It's<br>
    a good ship.</p>
  <p> RICE<br>
    Riker, refresh me, would you?<br>
    What's its size and complement?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Who's here with you?</p>
  <p> RICE<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    What's the armament on the<br>
    Lollipop?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Paul -- I will only answer your<br>
    questions if you answer mine.<br>
    Why do you want to know so much<br>
    about my ship?</p>
  <p> RICE<br>
    We're friends, aren't we?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Old friends.</p>
  <p> RICE<br>
    Our top speed is warp three.<br>
    What's yours?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Arsenal... &quot; - 1/25/88 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>13A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    &quot;Is?&quot; Then the Drake has not<br>
    been destroyed.</p>
  <p> RICE<br>
    The Drake?</p>

    Beverly who is startled. She stumbles backward. Data<br>
    calmly continues working. Tasha takes aim, as Picard<br>
    moves over next to Beverly. All this happens very<br>
    quickly -- the reaction instinctive. The team BECOMES<br>

  <p>48B ON PICARD (FORMERLY SCENE 39)</p>

    Correlate the trajectory of the<br>

    I'll compute the optimum spread<br>

    MOVES toward Tasha, THEY all FIRE - HITTING THE WEAPON<br>
    from different angles and putting the most possible<br>

  <p>71 INT. CAVERN</p>
  <p> Beverly is half buried under a ton of debris. Picard<br>
    tries to pull her out. He can't. But he clears away<br>
    more of the rubble.</p>
  <p>72 ANGLE ON BEVERLY</p>
  <p> drifting into unconsciousness; she's in very bad shape,<br>
    with multiple lacerations.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Arsenal... &quot; - 1/25/88 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>73 ON PICARD</p>
  <p> shaking her and talking to her -- desperately to keep<br>
    her awake.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh, no you don't -- no time to<br>
    sleep.</p>
  <p> But Beverly is falling rapidly --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (barely audible)<br>
    I'm tired. Very tired.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come on, stay with me, Doctor.</p>
  <p> She's very weak, and though she tries -- she can't keep<br>
    her eyes open. Picard's frustration builds --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Stay alert, Doctor! That's an<br>
    order, damn it!</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I must have lost a lot of blood.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've stopped the bleeding --</p>
  <p> Beverly makes an effort to shake her head.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There's another wound. My leg.</p>
  <p> Picard frantically digs away the rubble and mush around<br>
    her legs -- the DIRT IS A DEEP RED MUD from the blood.</p>
  <p>74 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Picard can't get to her wounds -- he must lift and pull<br>
    her legs from under the rubble.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is going to hurt a bit,<br>
    Doctor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (with the faintest of<br>
    smiles)<br>
    I heard that before.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Arsenal... &quot; - 1/25/88 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>74 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard then lifts her legs -- and Beverly does<br>
    everything to hold in a scream. But her expression<br>
    tells us just how much pain she's going through. This<br>
    is a woman of great courage! Picard then rips a piece<br>
    her smock into a makeshift bandage and strap for a<br>
    tourniquet. When that's done, Picard turns to Beverly:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor -- you have to stay awake<br>
    -- you have to help me! Tell me<br>
    what to do.</p>
  <p> Beverly nods -- she'll try.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What else can I do?</p>
  <p> Beverly makes an effort to point at something -- but<br>
    she is too weak to lift her hand.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The wound needs a clotting agent.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can't find your medical kit.</p>
  <p> She forces herself to look around.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Those roots. What are they?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    These?</p>
  <p> She nods. Picard pulls at a long root, breaking it off<br>
    and showing it to her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I don't know.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Break off a piece and taste it.<br>
    Don't swallow.</p>
  <p> Picard breaks open the root and pops a piece into his<br>
    mouth, and spits it out.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's very bitter --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Arsenal... &quot; - 1/25/88 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>74 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> She nods.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Good. Pound it into a paste and<br>
    spread in onto the wound.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand.</p>
  <p>75 ON PICARD</p>
  <p> as he SQUEEZES THE ROOT, making a sort of ointment.<br>
    When he has enough, he smears it on her wounds. Again,<br>
    Beverly begins to drift away.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What do we do next, Doctor?</p>
  <p> But Beverly is so tired --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Help me -- you've got to help me!</p>
  <p> Beverly opens her eyes -- fighting the sleep with all<br>
    her fading strength. Picard gets an idea -- he appeals<br>
    to her professionalism:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The patient has lost a great deal<br>
    of blood from multiple<br>
    lacerations. What's your<br>
    diagnosis, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Your patient is going into shock.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What do I do?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Elevate the legs and keep her<br>
    warm.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right. Stay with me, Doctor.<br>
    Keep talking...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Arsenal... &quot; - 1/25/88 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>75 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard gently lifts her legs -- resting them on top of<br>
    some rubble in an effort to keep the blood flowing to<br>
    her brain.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Did you happen to bring a blanket?</p>
  <p> Beverly is shivering and sweating profusely.</p>
  <p>76 ON PICARD</p>
  <p> anxiously looking at Beverly and then scanning the area<br>
    for something -- anything! -- to keep her warm.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, but I'll find something.</p>
  <p> He gets up and begins looking around for something.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Keep up your end. Stay awake.<br>
    That's an order, Doctor.</p>

  <p> It's the Peddler from the opening.</p>
  <p> THE PEDDLER<br>

    at the beginning, and all of these<br>
    devices which are capable of<br>
    learning and improving.}</p>

    You poor fools. The first time<br>

    What was that noise?</p>
  <p> THE PEDDLER<br>
    {Another (something from the model<br>

    Something about the demonstration.<br>
    that it is another one of the<br>

    Captain -- Data is coming down to<br>
    join you.</p>
  <p> With a little look, Riker takes a STEP BACKWARD.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Be my guest.</p>
  <p> And without further discussion or hesitation, Data<br>
    STEPS FORWARD AND DISAPPEARS.</p>

  <p> as Data FALLS IN, lands on his feet with great force.<br>
    His android legs absorb the impact.</p>

    We're going to have company in<br>

    Shields and deflectors are up.</p>

    (to Lian)<br>
    When I order the shields down,<br>
    you have one responsibility.<br>
    Locate the away team and get them<br>
    up here. You may only have a few<br>
    seconds.</p>
  <p> LIAN<br>
    Approaching the planet, sir.</p>
  <p> Geordi has picked up on Lian and Solis's look of<br>
    apprehension. He gets up from the Command chair,<br>
    CROSSES to them.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The ride's going to get a little<br>
    bumpy. Things are going to happen<br>
    fast.</p>
  <p> Although he's looking at both of them, his concerns are<br>
    more for the younger Ensign T'su.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Just keep alert... stay calm...<br>
    and focus on the task at hand.<br>
    You know your jobs.</p>
  <p>105A REACTIONS</p>
  <p> as Lian and Solis listen and draw courage from Geordi's<br>

  <p>106 INT. CAVERN</p>
  <p> Data is with Picard inspecting the computer. There is<br>
    a NOISE.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Another weapon has been launched.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have to find a way to stop this<br>
    system.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I need to see the program<br>
    schematic.</p>
  <p> Data expects Picard to answer, but it's the Peddler who<br>
    says:</p>
  <p> THE PEDDLER<br>
    You got it.</p>
  <p>107 ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The DIAGRAM OF THE WORKINGS of the system.</p>
  <p>107A BACK TO SHOT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is it possible to re-adjust the<br>
    targeting sequence?</p>
  <p> THE PEDDLER<br>
    Absolutely. They wouldn't be<br>
    much good if you couldn't.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, assign it a neutral target.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The target must be specific.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Arsenal... &quot; - 1/25/88 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>107A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Itself, then. Have it track<br>
    itself or the power source that<br>
    manufactures it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The force of that explosion would<br>
    destroy this chamber and evervone<br>
    near by.</p>
  <p> PEDDLER<br>
    Watch now - the Echo-Papa, Series<br>
    Six-oh-seven is about to complete<br>
    this phase of its mission.</p>
  <p> ON the Screen, the DOTS representing Tasha and Riker<br>

  <p> Tasha and Riker SCRAMBLE to find cover in the foliage.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> TASHA<br>
    None.</p>
  <p>107C INT. CAVERN</p>
  <p> Picard knows the clock is running out.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Give me some options, Data...<br>
    Quickly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Why don't you just shut it off?</p>
  <p> Picard REACTS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Is that possible?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Why not -- it's a machine, isn't<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Arsenal... &quot; - 1/25/88 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>107C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to the Peddler)<br>
    Shut it off.</p>
  <p> THE PEDDLER<br>
    But, you haven't seen half of<br>
    what this beauty can do.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We've seen enough.</p>
  <p> THE PEDDLER<br>
    Does that mean you are going to<br>
    buy it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If that's what it takes to shut<br>
    it off. Yes... I've seen enough --<br>
    you've made a sale.</p>
  <p> THE PEDDLER<br>
    You won't be sorry.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Now... end the demonstration.</p>
  <p> THE PEDDLER<br>
    Done.</p>
  <p> And the Peddler DISAPPEARS, and the screen goes DARK.<br>
    There is the SOUND OF SERVOS SHUTTING DOWN.</p>
  <p>108 EXT. PLANET SURFACE (FORMERLY &quot;INTERCUT&quot;)</p>
  <p> Riker and Tasha see the weapon MOVING through the<br>
    foliage and they know there's nothing they can do about<br>
    it. Riker gives Tasha a look, they both turn to face<br>
    the weapon. Suddenly, IT STOPS. Right where it is -<br>
    HANGS in the air for a moment, then DISSOLVES (or if<br>
    you like... just DROPS to the ground). Riker and Tasha<br>
    REACT with relief.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Number One!</p>
  <p> Riker is surprised to have his communicator working.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
