  <p> STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION <br>
    &quot;Conspiracy&quot; <br>
    <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> sweeps by majestically at warp. WE CLEARLY SEE THE<br>
    REGISTRY NUMBER on her wing -- ten foot tall navy blue<br>
    letters reading NCC-1701D.</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    First officer's log, stardate<br>
    41775.5. We are en route to the<br>
    ocean world known as Pacifica...</p>
  <p>2 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> The mood is relaxed. RIKER is at Command with TROI<br>
    beside him. WORF'S at Security, DATA and GEORDI at Ops<br>
    and Conn.</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Our mission is routinely<br>
    scientific in nature. We look<br>
    forward to seeing the warm blue<br>
    waters and fine white beaches that<br>
    make Pacifica a treasured jewel<br>
    of the galaxy.</p>
  <p>3 ANGLE ON DATA</p>
  <p> intently listening to the punchline of a joke Geordi's<br>
    telling...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (grinning)<br>
    ... So the guy staggers to his<br>
    feet and goes back to the girl.<br>
    She smiles, looks him right in<br>
    the eye and says &quot;Just try that<br>
    in hyperspace!&quot;</p>
  <p> Geordi LAUGHS at his own joke, but Data is simply<br>
    reflective.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - REV. 3/9/88 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (thoughtful)<br>
    Ah, I see. So the difficulty in<br>
    attaining such complex<br>
    positioning in a zero gravity<br>
    environment, coupled with the<br>
    adverse effect it would have on<br>
    the psychological well being of<br>
    the average human male, is what<br>
    makes this anecdote so amusing.<br>
    Yes. Very humorous indeed.<br>
    Hysterical, in fact.</p>
  <p> The look on his friend's face tells Data that something<br>
    is missing. Suddenly, he realizes what it is and<br>
    bursts into STIFF, FORCED LAUGHTER. It comes out<br>
    awkwardly and ends much too abruptly.</p>
  <p>4 BACK TO WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> Riker is smiling, having overheard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's our e.t.a. at Pacifica,<br>
    Mister La Forge?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Twenty two hours, fourteen<br>
    minutes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Increase to warp six.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Troi, mischievous)<br>
    Think anyone'll mind if we arrive<br>
    a little ahead of schedule?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (warm smile)<br>
    I know I won't. I've been looking<br>
    forward to a nice swim.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - 3/8/88 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are aware Counselor, that the<br>
    Holodeck can be programed to<br>
    recreate an oceanic environment.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's just not the same, Data.<br>
    Have you ever gone for a real<br>
    moonlight swim?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (deeply puzzled)<br>
    One can swim in moonlight?</p>
  <p> Troi rolls her eyes and turns to Worf...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How about you, Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (shaking head)<br>
    Swimming is too much like bathing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    -- Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> Data is monitoring something, looking concerned...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I am receiving a Code Forty-Seven.</p>
  <p> Riker frowns, instantly concerned...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Verify.</p>
  <p> Data rechecks his console...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (astounded)<br>
    It is a Code Forty-Seven, sir.<br>
    Starfleet emergency frequency.</p>
  <p> Riker and Troi exchange worried glances...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Code Forty-Seven... Captain's eyes<br>
    only.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - 3/8/88 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD BED<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The room is DARK, Picard is sleeping. THE SCREEN by<br>
    his bed COMES TO LIFE, awakening the Captain...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Riker on the bridge, Captain.<br>
    I'm sorry to disturb you.</p>
  <p> Picard is still a bit groggy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it, Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    An incoming message -- Code Forty<br>
    Seven, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard REACTS to the news. He sits up in bed, wearing<br>
    a form-fitting sleepsuit (warm and extremely<br>
    comfortable).</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Pipe it through.</p>
  <p> A YELLOW LIGHT above the screen FLASHES on and off<br>
    signifying that an urgent message is coming through.</p>
  <p>6 OMITTED</p>
  <p>7 ON SCREEN</p>
  <p> RIKER'S IMAGE IS instantly REPLACED BY THE official<br>
    SEAL OF STARFLEET and the United Federation of Planets.<br>
    A FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE addresses Picard...</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    This is an emergency communique.<br>
    It is not to be discussed with<br>
    fellow officers unless deemed<br>
    absolutely necessary. There will<br>
    be no computer record of said<br>
    transmission.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Understood.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Proceed with voice print<br>
    identification.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard, Jean-Luc. Captain, USS<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - REV. 3/9/88 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The screen HUMS momentarily...</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Voice print verified.</p>
  <p> The SEAL FADES OUT and a FACE FADES IN... It's the<br>
    noble face of WALKER KEEL, a striking middle-aged man<br>
    in a Starfleet captain's uniform. He is tall, with<br>
    piercing grey eyes and long brown hair just going<br>
    silver at the temples.</p>
  <p> Picard is clearly shocked, though not displeased, to<br>
    see him...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (half-whisper)<br>
    Walker...</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    Hello, Jean-Luc. Been a long<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Too long, my friend. Why are you<br>
    contacting me on this frequency?</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    It was a difficult decision. I<br>
    felt it was worth the risk.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Risk?!</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    It's about Starfleet... about<br>
    something we've always considered<br>
    to be impossible.</p>
  <p>8 MOVE IN ON PICARD</p>
  <p> grimly stunned by his friend's powerful words...</p>

  <p>10 INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - PICARD (CONTINUOUS ACTION)<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - 3/8/88 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't understand.</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    I can't explain it now. We need<br>
    to talk, face to face.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're using a Code Forty-Seven!<br>
    I have to know what this is all<br>
    about.</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    Not over subspace. No.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    For God's sake Walker, you know<br>
    this is a secure channel --</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    -- No!</p>
  <p> For the first time, Keel looks a little over the edge.</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I want you to meet me on Dytallix B.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (thinking it over)<br>
    When?</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    Immediately.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Impossible. We're expected at<br>
    Pacifica --</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    -- That can wait.</p>
  <p> Keel's face grows hard...</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You owe me. And you owe it to<br>
    yourself to hear what I have to<br>
    say.</p>
  <p> Picard is flustered and thoroughly confused. Still, he<br>
    is mesmerized by the bleak urgency in Walker's voice...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - 3/8/88 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    (continuing; slow,<br>
    measured)<br>
    Something's beginning... Have you<br>
    felt it?... Creeping out of the<br>
    woodwork...<br>
    (whisper)<br>
    An infestation.</p>
  <p>10A BACK TO TWO SHOT</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is?</p>
  <p> Keel looks long and hard at Picard -- as though<br>
    studying his face for some reason.</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    Don't trust anyone. Remember<br>
    that, Jean-Luc. Don't take<br>
    anything for granted.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Walker --</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    -- Dytallix B. We'll be waiting.</p>
  <p> KEEL'S IMAGE VANISHES as he ends the transmission.<br>
    Picard is left staring at the BLANK SCREEN -- the<br>
    YELLOW LIGHT REFLECTING OFF HIS FACE.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>11 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> The same crew is on the bridge. Picard EXITS the<br>
    turbolift and addresses them from the railing...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Are you familiar with Dytallix<br>
    B, Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Uh, well...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If I may, sir? Dytallix B is one<br>
    of seven uninhabited worlds mined<br>
    for the Federation by the Dytallix<br>
    Mining Company. I believe B is<br>
    in the nearby Mira system.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Fine. Chart a course for it<br>
    immediately, warp seven. And<br>
    there will be no records or<br>
    logs mentioning any aspect of<br>
    this diversion.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, they're expecting us at<br>
    Pacifica. Shouldn't we contact<br>
    them to let them know --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    -- Negative, Will. Nothing goes<br>
    out without specific orders from<br>
    me.</p>
  <p>12 ANGLE ON TROI</p>
  <p> watching the captain, concerned.</p>
  <p> PICARD (O.S.)<br>
    Hopefully our delay will be<br>
    minimal.</p>
  <p>13 BACK TO SHOT</p>
  <p> The captain EXITS to the Ready Room without another<br>
    word, leaving behind a concerned group of officers...</p>

  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why the devil would we be going<br>
    there? Are there any miners or<br>
    indigenous life forms on the<br>
    planet?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe the answer is negative<br>
    to both questions, sir. In a<br>
    manner of speaking, it is nothing<br>
    but a lifeless hunk of rock, a<br>
    useless ball of mud, a worthless<br>

    Three sir. All gathered inside<br>
    what appears to be the entrance<br>
    to a mining tunnel.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (moving toward<br>
    turbolift)<br>
    Very well. Relay those<br>
    coordinates to the Transporter<br>
    Room. I'm beaming down.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (a bit alarmed)<br>
    Alone, Captain?</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS the lift and turns to face Riker...</p>

  <p> MATERIALIZES into a narrow shaft which opens out to the<br>
    surface behind him. The entire TUNNEL IS BATHED IN<br>
    VIVID RED SUNLIGHT from Mira. WE CAN HEAR THE WIND<br>
    BLOWING like a hurricane outside.</p>
  <p>24A PICARD'S P.O.V.</p>
  <p> The tunnel is DARK and forboding.</p>
  <p>24B BACK TO SHOT</p>
  <p> As Picard moves forward, THREE FIGURES STEP OUT of the<br>

  <p> KEEL (O.S.)<br>
    (monotone)<br>
    Good to see you, Jean-Luc. Thanks<br>
    for coming.</p>
  <p>25 ANGLE ON THE THREE FIGURES</p>
  <p> as THEY STEP INTO THE LIGHT. Walker Keel is flanked by<br>
    a HANDSOME BLACK WOMAN and a BLUE-SKINNED BOLIAN.<br>
    Each is aiming a phaser directly at Picard's heart...</p>
  <p>26 INT. THE TUNNEL - ON PICARD</p>
  <p> under the barrel of the phasers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is some greeting, &quot;old<br>
    friend.&quot;</p>
  <p> Keel ignores the comment -- instead STEPPING FORWARD,<br>
    empty hands at his sides...</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    Tell me Jean-Luc -- where did we<br>
    first meet?</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't reply, thinking it ridiculous...</p>
  <p> BOLIAN<br>
    (tense, waving gun)<br>
    Answer the question!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - REV. 3/9/88 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard remains cool -- a thin smile on his lips.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On Tau Ceti III. It was a bar --<br>
    Quite an exotic one at that.<br>
    (looks at Bolian)<br>
    What do I win?</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    Do you recall the night you<br>
    introduced Jack Crusher to<br>
    Beverly?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You know full well I hadn't even<br>
    met Beverly then. You introduced<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    My brother introduced them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (losing patience)<br>
    You don't have a brother -- two<br>
    sisters, Anne and Melissa. Now<br>
    what the hell's this all about?!</p>
  <p> Keel takes a deep breath and nods at the others.<br>
    Slowly, they lower their weapons...</p>
  <p> RIXX<br>
    Apologies, Captain. We had to<br>
    make sure you were really you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Walker, what's going on?</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    Captain Picard, meet Captains<br>
    Scott and Rixx.</p>
  <p> The Bolian offers Picard his pale-blue hand...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I believe we've met... The<br>
    Altairian conference?</p>
  <p> Rixx smiles and bows slightly. At last he too is<br>
    convinced that Picard is Picard. Our captain turns<br>
    his gaze to the woman...</p>

  <p>26 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tryla Scott. It's said you made<br>
    captain faster than anyone in<br>
    Starfleet history, present company<br>
    included.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    Are you that good?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - REV. 3/9/88 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TRYLA<br>
    Yes. I am.</p>
  <p> Picard is impressed by her unblinking honesty. She<br>
    comes off confident, not arrogant. Picard addresses<br>
    all of them...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Starfleet's finest.<br>
    (looks around shaft)<br>
    Fancy meeting you here.</p>
  <p> RIXX<br>
    We all came secretly, Picard.<br>
    To discuss the threat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What threat?</p>
  <p> TRYLA<br>
    Have you noticed anything about<br>
    Starfleet Command lately?<br>
    Anything unusual?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (thinking about it)<br>
    No. We've been on the outer rim<br>
    for awhile. Haven't had much<br>
    contact with them.</p>
  <p> The other captains look at one another. The RED<br>
    SUNLIGHT CASTS EERIE SHADOWS across their faces...</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    Some of us have seen strange<br>
    patterns emerging. Unusual orders...<br>
    High-ranking officials backing<br>
    irrational proposals --</p>
  <p> RIXX<br>
    -- Starbase twelve was completely<br>
    evacuated for two full days! No<br>
    explanation given.</p>
  <p> TRYLA<br>
    And what about the deaths?<br>
    Mckinney... Ryan Sipe... Onna<br>
    Karapleedeez...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - REV. 3/9/88 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (quietly stunned)<br>
    All dead?</p>
  <p> TRYLA<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    A series of &quot;accidents&quot;.</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    Or so they say; it's hard to be<br>
    certain of anything. Interfleet<br>
    communications are at a minimum.<br>
    But something is happening.</p>
  <p> TRYLA<br>
    And we fully expect the Enterprise<br>
    to be targeted soon.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (incredulous)<br>
    Targeted for what? By whom?</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    We're not sure yet.</p>
  <p> Picard is clearly skeptical. These people seem to be<br>
    chasing shadows. Walker Keel addresses him with<br>
    renewed intensity...</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Dammit Jean-Luc, I tell you that<br>
    some of Starfleet's top command<br>
    people are changing! This could<br>
    affect the very core of our<br>
    organization. Officers I've known<br>
    for years are bluffing their way<br>
    through talk of old times!</p>
  <p> RIXX<br>
    That's their weakness! A lack<br>
    of memory.</p>
  <p> Picard turns away, troubled by the picture they're<br>
    painting.</p>
  <p> TRYLA<br>
    (scornful)<br>
    He doesn't believe us. He thinks<br>
    we're crazy.</p>

  <p>26 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (turning, angry)<br>
    You've given me nothing to believe<br>
    in! Just vague talk of wild<br>
    schemes. Who's behind it, and for<br>
    what purpose? How are people<br>
    being changed?</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    (softly)<br>
    I can't say exactly. But I think<br>
    its spread to my own ship.</p>
  <p> The WIND MOANS AND HOWLS outside the tunnel, ROCKS AND<br>
    SAND CAN BE HEARD SCRAPING against the walls...</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    My first officer hasn't been the<br>
    same since we stopped off at<br>
    Earth. Our medical officer says<br>
    he's perfectly normal, but I don't<br>
    think I trust him either.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (exasperated)<br>
    Walker --</p>
  <p> TRYLA<br>
    -- We know we don't have all the<br>
    answers. All we ask is that you<br>
    keep your eyes open.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's sound advice at any time,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    Stay in touch with us -- covertly.<br>
    This meeting never took place as<br>
    far as Starfleet is concerned.</p>
  <p> Keel can tell that Picard is clearly uncomfortable with<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Please... I'm asking you as a<br>
    personal favor.</p>
  <p> Reluctantly, Picard gives a slight nod, indicating<br>
    agreement. Keel grasps him warmly by the shoulders...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - 3/8/88 - ACT ONE 17.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    (continuing; warm,<br>
    intense)<br>
    I'm glad, Jean-Luc... Glad you're<br>
    still one of us.</p>
  <p> Keel smiles sadly and steps back...</p>
  <p> KEEL<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Tell Beverly... I said hello.</p>
  <p> RIXX<br>
    (sly smile)<br>
    And watch your back, Picard.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    It seems you're in turmoil.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Friends... close friends, are few<br>
    and far between. I'm a private<br>
    man, Deanna. My Starfleet duties<br>
    have shielded me from social<br>
    circles. My two oldest and<br>
    closest friends were Jack Crusher,<br>
    may he rest in peace, and Walker<br>
    Keel. Until various missions<br>
    split us apart, we were almost<br>
    inseparable.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    I trust Keel completely. If he<br>
    felt it necessary to violate<br>
    regulations, I know he must have<br>
    a good reason.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And you are about to put your<br>
    career at risk for him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Isn't that what friendship's all<br>
    about, Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    -- They illicitly used the<br>
    emergency channel to draw you<br>
    here. Then they asked you to keep<br>
    secrets from your superiors.<br>
    Effectively, to disobey Starfleet<br>
    regulations.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Don't you think you should tell<br>
    the rest of the crew?</p>

    No. I won't risk implicating<br>

    There is no proof of anything.</p>

    Starfleet's left hand did not know<br>
    what its right hand was doing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you speculate as to the<br>
    purpose of these reassignments?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe it is a clandestine<br>
    attempt to control vital sectors<br>
    of Federation territory.</p>
  <p> A stillness hangs over the room as the implications of<br>
    Data's bold statement sinks in...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It could be a prelude to invasion.<br>
    But who's behind it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is insufficient data to make<br>
    such an assesment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What do you suggest we do, warp<br>
    over to Starfleet headquarters<br>
    and demand to know what's going<br>
    on?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Why not?!</p>

    Yes...<br>

    regal Vulcan. AARON is old and lean -- hollow cheeks<br>
    and cold, piercing eyes, beneath a shock of white hair.<br>
    QUINN looks much the same as he did in &quot;Coming Of Age.&quot;</p>
  <p> The three senior admirals are seated at an impressive<br>
    looking table with a Starfleet banner on the wall<br>
    behind them. Throughout this sequence, Savar always<br>
    speaks with the calm, cool rationality we expect from a<br>
    Vulcan...</p>
  <p> SAVAR<br>
    Greetings Enterprise. I am<br>
    Admiral Savar. This is Admiral<br>
    Aaron, and I believe you know<br>
    Admiral Quinn.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. Good to see you again,<br>
    Admiral.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    And you, Captain.</p>
  <p> SAVAR<br>
    Of course. We are always delighted<br>
    when the Enterprise returns to<br>
    the nest. Yet we are puzzled by<br>
    the timing of your visit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes sir, I can imagine you would<br>
    be.</p>
  <p> AARON<br>
    (harsh sounding)<br>
    Governor Delaplane of Pacifica<br>
    informs us that you canceled your<br>
    scheduled stop there. Is this<br>
    true?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is, sir.</p>
  <p> AARON<br>
    Explain yourself, Captain. Why<br>
    have you returned to Earth?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That... is something I'd rather<br>
    discuss in person, Admiral.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can't say I'm overjoyed to see<br>
    Remmick again.</p>

    can't trust --</p>
  <p> Worf cuts off in mid-sentence as THE THREE ADMIRALS<br>
    REAPPEAR ON SCREEN. Remmick is gone.</p>
  <p> SAVAR<br>
    Forgive the delay, Captain Picard.<br>
    We'd be delighted if you and your<br>
    first officer would join us for<br>
    dinner.</p>
  <p> AARON<br>
    Yes. Delighted.</p>
  <p> SAVAR<br>
    This should give you a good<br>

    viewpoint.</p>
  <p> AARON<br>

    inside the small briefcase he is carrying. Looking<br>
    something like an oversized silverfish, it wriggles<br>
    violently just before he shuts the case. A door OPENS<br>
    and Remmick ENTERS and addresses the man (who we still<br>
    cannot identify).</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    Are you ready to beam up to the<br>

  <p> The old admiral shakes Rikers hand vigorously.<br>
    Something begins to strike Picard as slightly odd, but<br>
    he masks his feelings...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I must say, you're looking well.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Never felt better in my life.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    tired you'd been feeling.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>

    Tired of life, I was. But not<br>
    anymore. I look forward to new<br>

    of what I said?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's one of the reasons.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    (grinning broadly)<br>
    Jean-Luc! You took me far too<br>
    literally. I was only referring<br>
    to the difficulty involved in<br>

  <p> QUINN (O.S.)<br>

    Now gentlemen, I believe you have<br>

    like to freshen up a bit before<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    We have a guest accommodation at<br>

  <p> QUINN<br>
    Outstanding.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (still a bit dazed)<br>
    I should be getting down to the<br>

    anything you'd like to see.</p>
  <p> Riker and Quinn both seem surprised to hear this...</p>

    him... but it isn't him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Can you be absolutely certain,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am certain, Number One. I want<br>
    you to go back to that cabin and<br>
    keep your eye on his every move.<br>
    Have Beverly concoct a reason for<br>
    a complete medical examination.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't care how! Just do it!<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    It's not him, Will. I know that<br>
    now. What we need to find out<br>

    you again, Captain.</p>
  <p> Savar and Aaron lead Picard down the hall, with<br>
    Remmick a few strides behind.</p>

    off guard...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ready for your tour, Admiral?</p>
  <p> Quinn quickly stands, but Riker has seen the<br>
    briefcase...</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Quite ready, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's in the case?</p>
  <p> From where he stands, Riker can barely see a few<br>
    delicate-looking tendrils coming out of its opening...<br>
    He looks at the Admiral somewhat suspiciously...</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    (thoughtful)<br>
    Actually... I brought this for<br>
    Doctor Crusher. But perhaps you'd<br>
    like you to see it first?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (slowly moving closer)<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    A form of life. Discovered quite<br>
    accidentally by a survey team on<br>
    a distant uncharted planet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why haven't we heard anything<br>
    about that?</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Oh, you'll be hearing more about<br>
    it shortly. But first there is<br>
    much scientific study to be done.<br>
    After all, this is a superior lifeform.</p>

    Now come, Riker. Take a good<br>
    look.</p>
  <p> Riker stands where he is, uncertain of what to do.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think I'll summon our science<br>
    officer --</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    It won't like your science<br>
    officer. It likes you.<br>
    (rises, grabs Riker's<br>
    arm)<br>
    Now look!</p>
  <p> Riker looks down at his arm and grimaces; Quinn is<br>
    squeezing it with tremendous force. Riker grasps the<br>
    old man's wrist and tries to pull it off him... he<br>
    can't.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    (dark smile)<br>
    Vitamins. They do wonders for<br>
    the body.</p>
  <p> RIKER CRIES OUT -- it feels like Quinn is crushing his<br>
    arm. Unable to break free, HE RAISES HIS OTHER ARM<br>
    TO STRIKE the admiral. Riker's BLOW IS BLOCKED and<br>
    QUINN responds by effortlessly THROWING HIM backwards<br>
    toward the wall. The FIRST OFFICER hits it at<br>
    breakneck speed and CRUMPLES TO THE FLOOR, severely<br>
    dazed...</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    (dry -- evil smile)<br>
    Ahh, your life is so painful now.<br>
    But soon you'll be one of us.</p>
  <p> Before Riker can clear his head, QUINN ATTACKS again<br>
    -- rapping him across the chin WITH A KARATE KICK.<br>
    Riker staggers to his feet -- Quinn swings from the<br>
    heels with a sure knockout blow... RIKER DUCKS under<br>
    it and puts all his weight behind a powerful PUNCH to<br>
    THE ADMIRAL'S solar plexus.</p>

    before DEALING HIM A vicious double fisted BACKHAND.</p>
  <p> Riker hits his communicator.</p>

    amber colored liquid. Remmick continues to quietly<br>
    look on from a distance...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'd like to begin the discussion<br>
    of why I'm here.</p>
  <p> AARON<br>
    In time Captain, in time. First,<br>
    a toast.</p>
  <p> Aaron and Savar raise their glasses... Finally, Picard<br>
    does the same.</p>
  <p> AARON<br>
    To the Horatio, gentlemen.</p>
  <p> SAVAR<br>
    The Horatio.</p>
  <p> The captain warily clinks glasses with the others.<br>
    They sip the liquid, but Picard simply lowers his<br>
    glass...</p>
  <p> AARON<br>
    (faintly sarcastic)<br>
    What an awful tragedy. Such a<br>
    terrible loss of life.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's interesting you mention the<br>
    Horatio. That's one of the things<br>
    I wanted to discuss.</p>
  <p> AARON<br>
    (dry)<br>
    Really?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Has the cause of her destruction<br>
    been ascertained?</p>
  <p> SAVAR<br>
    Absolutely.<br>
    (looking straight at<br>
    Picard)<br>
    Implosion, due to extreme<br>
    negligence on the part of her<br>
    captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - REV. 3/11/88 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>74 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard wants to cry out in defense of Keel, but he<br>
    realizes that would be a foolish thing to do at the<br>
    moment. Aaron gleefully senses his discomfort...</p>
  <p> AARON<br>
    Drink up, Picard. I believe<br>
    you'll find it an excellent<br>
    aperitif.</p>
  <p>75 INT. QUINN'S QUARTERS - QUINN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> is sitting calmly on the sofa with the unconscious<br>
    Riker at his feet when the door OPENS. Worf and Geordi<br>
    BOLT IN.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    It's good that you're here. He<br>
    slipped and hit his head.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (into intercom)<br>
    This is Lieutenant La Forge in<br>
    Guest Quarter Sixteen. We have<br>
    a possible medical emergency.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Your Doctor Crusher is most<br>
    capable; I'm sure he'll be all<br>
    right. Now if you'll excuse me,<br>
    my time here is limited...</p>
  <p> Quinn MOVES TOWARD THE DOOR, but Geordi blocks his<br>
    path. Quinn looks to Worf as though he's about to<br>
    question what is going on, then quickly flies into<br>
    action, LEAPING TOWARD GEORDI. The blind man<br>
    BACKPEDDLES, FIRING HIS PHASER directly into the old<br>
    Admiral's chest.</p>
  <p> Quinn halts, temporarily. Then Geordi and Worf are<br>
    stunned to see Quinn BRUSH OFF THE EFFECTS OF THE<br>
    PHASER with a simple shake of his head. With amazing<br>
    quickness, HE LIFTS GEORDI AND brutally THROWS HIM<br>
    into the door. GEORDI GOES OUT the door and HITS THE<br>
    FLOOR, unconscious.</p>
  <p> This leaves Quinn and Worf to face off over a gaggle<br>
    of comatose bodies...</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    (evil smile)<br>
    Come on, Klingon. It's just you<br>
    and me now...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - 3/8/88 - ACT FIVE 43.</p>
  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>76 INT. QUINN'S QUARTERS - WORF AND QUINN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> are about to fight it out. Quinn is savagely smug and<br>
    barely breathing hard after mopping the floor with<br>
    Geordi and Riker. Worf must get over the shock of<br>
    seeing an old man with the strength of ten.</p>
  <p> The Klingon psyches himself up and CRIES OUT LIKE A<br>
    WARRIOR as he makes a move on Quinn. WORF THROWS A<br>
    PUNCH that would knock the head off Mike Tyson... It<br>
    lands squarely on Quinn's chin, jerking his head to<br>
    the side.</p>
  <p> Worf can't believe his eyes when QUINN'S HEAD SNAPS<br>
    BACK INTO PLACE -- the Admiral is smiling, seemingly<br>
    unaffected by the punch.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Do Klingons fear death as much<br>
    as humans? I could snap your neck<br>
    in a second, but that wouldn't<br>
    be as much fun.</p>
  <p> QUINN GRABS WORF'S STOMACH -- his hands digging deep<br>
    into the flesh. WORF BELLOWS in pain as QUINN LIFTS<br>
    HIM off the ground by his stomach muscles. The old<br>
    man's strength is mind- boggling.</p>
  <p> Suddenly a PHASER BLAST HITS QUINN dead on. Mildly<br>
    stunned but still standing, he lets go of Worf and<br>
    turns to face his new adversary.</p>
  <p>77 ANGLE ON BEVERLY</p>
  <p> standing in the doorway, phaser in hand.</p>
  <p>78 ANGLE TO INCLUDE QUINN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> disregarding Worf and moving toward her. SHE FIRES<br>
    AGAIN... Halted for an instant, HE MOVES FORWARD...<br>
    SHE FIRES AGAIN... Though slowed, HE KEEPS COMING...<br>
    SHE FIRES AGAIN... He stiffens, the phaser blasts are<br>
    starting to take a toll -- he still moves forward,<br>
    nearing her now.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - REV. 3/9/88 - ACT FIVE 44.</p>
  <p>78 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Beverly fires again and again, DRIVING HIM TO HIS<br>
    KNEES. WORF'S FIST FLIES INTO FRAME, catching the side<br>
    of Quinn's head with a powerful smash. QUINN SLUMPS<br>
    to the ground, incapacitated at last.</p>
  <p> Beverly and Worf are breathing hard, shellshocked by<br>
    the battle. Quinn lies quivering at their feet -- his<br>
    metabolism racing crazily even though he's unconscious.</p>
  <p> Geordi is coming around.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Are you all right?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (groaning)<br>
    If I could see... I'd be seeing<br>
    stars.</p>
  <p> Geordi sits up. Behind him, Beverly is kneeling over<br>
    the unconscious Riker. Worf indicates the twitching<br>
    admiral lying before them. The Klingon rubs his sore<br>
    stomach and speaks with detectable awe...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Who... what is he?</p>
  <p> Beverly stares at &quot;Quinn&quot; before answering.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Let's find out.</p>
  <p>79 INT. SICKBAY - QUINN</p>
  <p> lies on a Sickbay bed. Riker can be seen lying<br>
    unconscious on a bed in the background. Beverly stands<br>
    over Quinn with Worf and Geordi beside her...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (disturbed)<br>
    Retinal scans are an exact match<br>
    ... It really is Quinn!</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    How can that be? He picked me<br>
    up like a rag doll.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - REV. 3/9/88 - ACT FIVE 45.</p>
  <p>80 ANGLE FAVORING QUINN</p>
  <p> tossing his head back and forth in restless sleep.<br>
    Beverly administers a hypo before he can reawaken.<br>
    He calms down a bit, his head resting on its side.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm going to run a complete<br>
    internal scan.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Keep me posted, Doctor. I'll<br>
    be on the bridge.</p>
  <p> Geordi EXITS. Beverly is transfixed by something she<br>
    spots on the back of Quinn's neck...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    What is this?</p>
  <p> It's a small blue splinter-like thing protruding<br>
    slightly from the base of the neck...</p>
  <p> Beverly leans down to get a closer look... She<br>
    hesitantly reaches forward to touch it... and it moves!</p>
  <p>81 INT. RECEPTION AREA, EARTH - PICARD</p>
  <p> and the two admirals are still waiting to enter the<br>
    dining room.</p>
  <p> AARON<br>
    (trace of a smile)<br>
    What do you know of conspiracies,<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (surprised by the<br>
    question)<br>
    Not nearly enough I suppose.</p>
  <p> AARON<br>
    But that's the charming thing<br>
    about them, isn't it? When a<br>
    machination is real, no one knows<br>
    about it. And when it's<br>
    suspected, it's almost never real.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - 3/8/88 - ACT FIVE 46.</p>
  <p>81 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SAVAR<br>
    Except of course, in the paranoid<br>
    delusions of those who believe.</p>
  <p> The dining room doors swing OPEN and Remmick STEPS OUT<br>
    and addresses them...</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    Sorry to interrupt. Dinner is<br>
    served.</p>
  <p> AARON<br>
    Wonderful! Bantering with the<br>
    captain has given me quite an<br>
    appetite.</p>
  <p> They start to move toward the dining room, but Picard<br>
    lingers in the hallway...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'd like to contact my ship. To<br>
    inform Commander Riker that we're<br>
    ready to sit down.</p>
  <p> Aaron is about to object to this but Savar cuts him<br>
    off, nodding graciously...</p>
  <p> SAVAR<br>
    Of course, Captain. We'll wait<br>
    for you at the table.</p>
  <p> Picard waits until the two admirals have gone inside,<br>
    before activating his communicator. He speaks in<br>
    hushed tones with one eye on the dining room door...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard to Riker.</p>
  <p>82 INT. SICKBAY (INTERCUT AS NEEDED) - RIKER</p>
  <p> is still dead to the world. Beverly answers for him...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Doctor Crusher here, Captain.<br>
    May I speak freely?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (looking around)<br>
    I suppose we have no choice.<br>
    Where's Riker?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - REV. 3/9/88 - ACT FIVE 47.</p>
  <p>82 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He was attacked by Quinn. Or what<br>
    We thought was Quinn.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Specify, Doctor.</p>
  <p>83 ANGLE TO SEE QUINN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> resting fitfully on the bed -- and a large diagram of<br>
    his body on the medical screen above it. WE CAN SEE<br>
    A STRANGE INSECT-LIKE ANIMAL IS LIVING INSIDE HIM.<br>
    It's tendrils have wrapped themselves around the stem<br>
    of Quinn's brain.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    A parasitic being has invaded his<br>
    body. It has complete control<br>
    over all brain functions. It<br>
    seems to breath through a small<br>
    &quot;gill&quot; protruding through the back<br>
    of Quinn's neck. Look for this,<br>
    Captain. I believe it will be<br>
    visible on anyone who has been<br>
    compromised.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any idea what it is or where it<br>
    comes from?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Negative. I've never seen<br>
    anything like it before.</p>
  <p> WE HEAR GEORDI'S INTERCOM VOICE summoning Worf to the<br>
    bridge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Lieutenant Worf. If the situation<br>
    is under control, we could use<br>
    you on the bridge.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (looks to Worf)<br>
    It's okay. He won't be waking<br>
    up for a long time.</p>
  <p> Worf EXITS, leaving Beverly alone with the unconscious<br>
    forms of Quinn and Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Continue, Doctor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - REV. 3/9/88 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p>83 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    By the placement of the tendrils,<br>
    the parasite appears to stimulate<br>
    the vicim's adrenal glands which<br>
    generate great strength and<br>
    resistence to --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    -- Spare me the medical details,<br>
    Doctor. Just tell me if you can<br>
    remove it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not without killing the patient.</p>
  <p> Unseen by Beverly, Riker bolts upright in the bed<br>
    behind her. Wild-eyed and seemingly disoriented, he<br>
    slowly begins to rise...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You must set your phaser on kill,<br>
    Captain. Stun has little effect --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor, one does not beam into<br>
    Starfleet Headquarters armed.</p>
  <p> Just then, Remmick EXITS the dining room and walks by<br>
    Picard...</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    (as he passes)<br>
    Your food is getting cold,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    About to go to dinner now, Doctor.<br>
    Have Riker join me when he's<br>
    available. Picard out.</p>
  <p> Beverly is anxious and doesn't want to terminate the<br>
    conversation. Riker is moving up behind her... She<br>
    turns and GASPS just as he puts his hand on her<br>
    shoulder --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - REV. 3/8/88 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>84 INT. DINING ROOM - PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> is seated across from Aaron and Savar at a polished<br>
    black table. Three other settings are unattended --<br>
    in front of each is a silver bowl-like covering that<br>
    conceals the entree.</p>
  <p> A ceremonial guard lines the wall beside the table...</p>
  <p> AARON<br>
    Go ahead and start, Captain. We<br>
    don't stand on ceremony around<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> Picard removes the lid and is repulsed to find a plate<br>
    full of squirming worm-like things -- moving around<br>
    like living spaghetti.</p>
  <p> Picard quickly pushes his plate away and watches in<br>
    abstract horror as Savar and Aaron greedily use their<br>
    hands to down their portions of the same living meal.</p>
  <p> The Guard MOVES FORWARD and wolfs down a bowl of the<br>
    stuff.</p>
  <p> AARON<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Oh do eat up, Picard. Just raise<br>
    your hand if you want seconds.</p>
  <p> The admirals and the guards laugh salaciously. The<br>
    sight of a Vulcan giggling as he chews on live worms<br>
    is too much for Picard to bear.</p>
  <p> Jumping to his feet, he turns and runs right into<br>
    Number One. Riker roughly shoves the captain back into<br>
    his seat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're not going anywhere.</p>
  <p> Picard closes his eyes in dull shock as Aaron walks<br>
    to Riker and reveals the blue splinter on the back<br>
    of Riker's neck...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing;<br>
    to Picard)<br>
    You'll be one of us soon.</p>
  <p> Riker nods at the others as he sits down at the table.</p>
  <p> AARON<br>
    (angry)<br>
    You were meant for the doctor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - 3/8/88 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>84 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It couldn't be helped. Riker<br>
    walked in on us unexpectedly.</p>
  <p> SAVAR<br>
    No matter. The doctor will soon<br>
    be joining us. All in good time.</p>
  <p> A door OPENS and Tryla Scott WALKS IN and takes her<br>
    place at the table.</p>
  <p> SAVAR<br>
    Ah, Captain Scott. Good, the<br>
    setting is now complete.</p>
  <p> It's a bitter blow to Picard when her evil smile lets<br>
    him know that she's been one of them all along. She<br>
    takes a strand of &quot;live spaghetti&quot; and delicately gulps<br>
    it down.</p>
  <p> AARON<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    You didn't really think we were<br>
    in the dark about your intentions,<br>
    did you?</p>
  <p> SAVAR<br>
    Patience is one of our virtues,<br>
    Captain. Instead of going after<br>
    you, we allowed you to come to<br>
    us.</p>
  <p> AARON<br>
    More dramatic this way, don't you<br>
    think?</p>
  <p> TRYLA<br>
    Yes... one thing both races share<br>
    is a love of theatre. And you've<br>
    put on a fine show.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (shellshocked)<br>
    What exactly is your race? Where<br>
    do you come from?</p>
  <p> SAVAR<br>
    It's not important. Let's just<br>
    say... we've come a long way to<br>
    join you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - REV. 3/8/88 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>84 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TRYLA<br>
    (grinning)<br>
    It's a perfect match. We're the<br>
    brains and you're the brawn.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (cold)<br>
    You'll understand soon, Picard.</p>
  <p> SAVAR<br>
    Indeed. We've been moving slowly,<br>
    cautiously, for many months now.<br>
    Careful to cover our tracks.<br>
    Careful not to arouse suspicion,<br>
    until it's too late.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    And it is too late. For you, that<br>
    is.</p>
  <p> AARON<br>
    Well said, brother. Picard and<br>
    Riker control the Enterprise.<br>
    Which means we control the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Dejected, Picard watches as Riker removes the lid and<br>
    takes a big handful of living spaghetti. He tilts his<br>
    head back and prepares to swallow it.</p>
  <p> SAVAR<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    Eat hearty, brother! Relish your<br>
    new body!</p>
  <p> Just as the worms are about to touch his tongue, RIKER<br>
    shocks everyone by PULLING A PHASER AND FIRING at the<br>
    guard. HE quivers before DROPPING like a fly.</p>
  <p> Tryla fires at Riker and misses. Picard seizes the<br>
    moment, grabbing the phaser from the unconscious<br>
    Guard. Aaron pushes Picard to the ground and BOLTS<br>
    FOR THE DOOR. Before Picard can pivot to pick him off,<br>
    TRYLA SCOTT JUMPS UP AND takes aim on him. SHE FIRES,<br>
    barely missing his head. RIKER CUTS HER DOWN before<br>
    she can fire again. Scott quivers and drops. A<br>
    PARASITE quickly FLEES her open mouth...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - REV. 3/8/88 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>84 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Meanwhile, Savar has charged Riker and has him in a<br>
    death grip around the throat. PICARD FIRES INTO THE<br>
    VULCAN'S BACK...</p>
  <p> The VULCAN drops to his knees, finally releasing his<br>
    grip. He falls over, dead.</p>
  <p> Still holding his throat, Riker reaches back and<br>
    removes the counterfeit splinter from his neck.<br>
    Suddenly, both he and Picard have the same thought...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Aaron!</p>
  <p>85 INT. GREAT HALLWAY - AARON (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> is desperate, running straight toward us down the long<br>
    hallway. Far behind, Picard and Riker come around a<br>
    corner and take aim...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (calling out)<br>
    Hold it, Aaron!</p>
  <p> Aaron spins and FIRES -- Picard and Riker dive out of<br>
    the way. The Admiral keeps running... he's almost at<br>
    the end of the hall... RIKER AND PICARD FIRE, scoring<br>
    two direct hits. AARON WINCES AND GOES DOWN. His<br>
    momentum sends him sliding along the smooth floor.</p>
  <p>86 ANGLE ON PICARD AND RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> running up to the body. They get there just in time<br>
    to see the PARASITE evacuating it. Before they can<br>
    fire, it SCURRIES AROUND THE CORNER and out of sight.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Come on!</p>
  <p>87 INT. ANOTHER SECTION OF HALLWAY - PICARD AND RIKER</p>
  <p> cautiously turn the corner. In the distance, they see<br>
    the CREATURE SLITHER UNDER A DOOR...</p>
  <p> Hurrying to the door, they give each other a long look,<br>
    knowing that anything could be behind it. At last,<br>
    Riker touches a wall panel and the door slides OPEN...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - 3/8/88 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>88 ANGLE INTO THE ROOM</p>
  <p> where Remmick is tapping on an unknown object similar<br>
    to a typewriter. A HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING SOUND is<br>
    emanating from it... Remmick looks up at Riker and<br>
    Picard, his face a mask of calm innocence.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    Can I help you, gentlemen?</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker aren't sure just what to make of this.<br>
    Remmick seems so placid and unconcerned.</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    Is there any trouble? Perhaps<br>
    if you'd tell me what it is --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    -- Remmick!</p>
  <p> Picard is pointing to a PARASITE that is beginning to<br>
    CLIMB UP REMMICK'S LEG. Riker raises his phaser,<br>
    preparing to fire on it, but Picard blocks that with<br>
    his forearm</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, Will!</p>
  <p>88A ANGLE FAVORING REMMICK (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> looking on wide-eyed, as the Parasite climbs up his<br>
    arm and onto his shoulder. Picard and Riker are<br>
    momentarily paralyzed, unsure of what to do.</p>
  <p> Remmick looks from the creature to the two Officers<br>
    with a stoic expression on his face. Then, in a<br>
    strange almost lizard-like movement, he rolls his head<br>
    to the side and opens his mouth. In an instant, the<br>
    PARASITE SCAMPERS INTO HIS MOUTH and down his throat.</p>
  <p> Remmick addresses the stunned Picard and Riker as<br>
    though nothing of consequence had happened...</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>
    (calm, sincere)<br>
    You don't understand.</p>
  <p> As he speaks, his NECK BULGES as some of the creatures<br>
    dart around inside it...</p>
  <p> REMMICK<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - REV. 3/14/88 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>88A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Remmick is slowly starting to rise... Picard and Riker<br>
    look at each other as if to say &quot;freak this!&quot; They OPEN<br>
    FIRE, DRIVING REMMICK BACK down into his chair.</p>
  <p> The upper half of REMMICK'S BODY BEGINS TO DISSIPATE<br>
    under the phaser fire... A bizarre form is taking its<br>
    place. Shaped vaguely like a man, IT LOOKS LIKE A<br>
    liquidy BUBBLE WITH HUNDREDS OF PARASITES swarming<br>
    around inside it.</p>
  <p> The BUBBLE BEGINS TO COLLAPSE down into what used to be<br>
    Remmick's lower abdomen. Another SHAPE IS REVEALED as<br>
    the gooey mass collapses. It is dull yellow -- looking<br>
    LIKE A CROSS BETWEEN A PARASITE AND A HUMAN FETUS.</p>
  <p> It looks at Picard and Riker and CRIES OUT WITH AN<br>
    ANGRY ROAR. Picard and Riker concentrate on its head<br>
    and SCORE A DIRECT HIT between the eyes... The<br>
    FETUS-CREATURE EXPLODES AND THE PARASITES DISSIPATE<br>
    into nothingness...</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker CEASE FIRING. All that's left before<br>
    them is a smoldering mass -- a pair of legs and part<br>
    of a spine that used to be Dexter Remmick...</p>

    Captain's log, stardate 41780.2.<br>
    Admiral Quinn is expected to make<br>
    a full recovery...</p>
  <p>90 INT. SICKBAY - QUINN</p>
  <p> is sitting up in bed, being fed liquid by Beverly.<br>
    He seems weak but in general okay as he flashes her<br>
    a small smile.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There is no trace of the parasite<br>
    which took control of him. We'll<br>
    never know how many of these<br>
    life-forms infiltrated Starfleet,<br>
    but it seems they could not<br>
    survive without the &quot;mother<br>
    creature&quot; which had taken over<br>
    Commander Remmick...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conspiracy&quot; - REV. 3/9/88 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>91 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... Still, the haunting question<br>
    remains... Who were these<br>
    beings... and will we ever have<br>
    to face them again?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    It was Doctor Crusher's idea to<br>
    simulate the blue splinter. We<br>
    had to make sure it would fool<br>
    everyone, including you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That it did, Number One. Rest<br>
    assured.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have attempted to trace the<br>
    message Remmick was sending. I<br>
    believe it was aimed at an<br>
    unexplored quadrant of our galaxy.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Any idea what the message was,<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> Data seems reluctant to answer.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Well... I believe it was a beacon.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (half-whisper)<br>
    A beacon?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Captain. A homing beacon...<br>
    sent from Earth.</p>
  <p>92 EXT. ENTERPRISE - DEEP SPACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The great ship roars past us... PAN away from her and<br>
    toward the endless black void of deep space... WE HEAR<br>
    a sound... AN INCREDIBLY HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING SOUND<br>
    that repeats its intricate pattern over and over.</p>
  <p> A sound waiting for a reply...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
