    &quot;We'll Always Have Paris&quot; <br>
    <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it streaks through the stars at warp speed.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 41886.9.<br>
    We are en route to Sarona 8 for<br>
    much needed R and R. The entire<br>
    crew is looking forward to the<br>
    diversion. On a personal note,<br>
    I have allowed myself the luxury<br>
    of a head start.</p>
  <p>2 INT. ENTERPRISE - GYMNASIUM</p>
  <p> It is starkly and simply set up for competitive saber<br>
    fencing. PICARD and RIKER are dressed in traditional<br>
    white jumpsuits, gloves, shoes and masks. They stand<br>
    in the middle of three long lanes about six feet apart.<br>
    They snap their masks in place.</p>
  <p> PICARD MOVES HIS</p>
  <p> right leg forward, weight centered, hand on hip. His<br>
    saber is down.</p>
  <p> HE TURNS THE SABER</p>
  <p> so the cutting edge of the blade moves to the left,<br>
    then brings it to his head with a flourish.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    En garde.</p>
  <p> PICARD STEPS FORWARD</p>
  <p> as his blade comes up, pointed at the Riker's face.</p>
  <p> THEIR BLADES CROSS</p>
  <p> as Riker half-lunges forward, arm extended, to a chest<br>
    shot. Picard steps back and parries.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD SNAPS AND BEATS</p>
  <p> Riker's sword, knocking it to the side. He does a full<br>
    lunge forward, with a downward slice.</p>
  <p> RIKER HIGH BLOCKS</p>
  <p> the move, and lunges forward with a flank cut to<br>
    Picard's ribs. He continues with a fleche, then a head<br>
    cut, continuing with fleche parries.</p>
  <p> RIKER SCORES</p>
  <p> with an inverted thrust to Picard's heart. Picard<br>
    steps back and salutes. Riker answers in kind.</p>
  <p> THEIR MASKS</p>
  <p> come off, but not their rank.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I took advantage...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, no. The advantage was yours,<br>
    Number One. I'm out of<br>
    practice... too much time on the<br>
    bridge. En garde!</p>
  <p> PICARD REPLACES HIS MASK</p>
  <p> and they begin again.</p>
  <p> PICARD FAKES RIKER</p>
  <p> out with a cheek cut, turning his blade down, then, in<br>
    a swashbuckling movement, he SLAMS the heel of his<br>
    sword right on Riker's guard, comes in with a cheek<br>
    cut, then rolls the sword and quickly lunges in with a<br>
    head cut, pulls the sword back in and THRUSTS it to<br>
    Riker's heart. Riker is surprised as</p>
  <p> PICARD SCORES</p>
  <p> and they step back and salute each other with their<br>
    swords.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Interesting move. What technique<br>
    was that?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The technique of a desperate man.<br>
    Shall we...</p>
  <p> He is interrupted by the GREAT SHUDDER AND ROLL of the<br>
    ship as the Enterprise is hit by some MASSIVE FORCE.<br>
    He and Riker are thrown around like dolls as LIGHTS<br>
    FLICKER ON AND OFF. Finally, the ship stabilizes.</p>
  <p> PICARD AND RIKER HURRY TO</p>
  <p> the com panel.</p>

    Picard to bridge. Report.</p>
  <p>3 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> THE BRIDGE CREW MOVE TO THEIR STATIONS, returning to<br>
    normal.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is not an attack that we know<br>
    of, Captain. Origin unknown.<br>
    Sensors did not detect the force<br>
    until immediately prior to impact.<br>
    Shields did not have time to<br>
    respond. Damages unknown.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    We're on our way, Mister Data.</p>

    Damage reports from all decks<br>
    coming in, sir.</p>

    Injuries?</p>

    Minor.</p>

  <p> instruments, puzzled.</p>

  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I still am unable to determine<br>
    the cause of the energy force.<br>
    There is nothing within a<br>
    reasonable distance of this ship<br>
    powerful enough to cause an impact<br>
    of that magnitude.</p>
  <p> THE TURBOLIFT OPENS</p>
  <p> and Picard and Riker ENTER the bridge, still dressed<br>
    in their fencing clothes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Damages and injuries are minimal.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where did it come from?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am still checking, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hazard a guess, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It appears to originate from the<br>
    Pegos Minor sector.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That far?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD TAKES</p>
  <p> his Command Chair.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant La Forge, set<br>
    coordinates for that sector.<br>
    Shields at full power.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir. Coordinates laid in.</p>

  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, I am receiving a transmission<br>
    from Pegos Minor. It's an S.O.S.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Put it on audio, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> A SHAKEN VOICE ECHOES</p>
  <p> through the bridge. The crew listens intently.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM'S COM VOICE<br>
    I repeat, this is Doctor Paul<br>
    Manheim. We are in need of help.<br>
    Urgent. Any ship please respond.<br>
    Coordinates are six-six-seven<br>
    eight point nine by<br>
    seven-zero-seven-five-four-two<br>
    point two. Manheim out.</p>
  <p> The transmission is on a loop and begins to REPEAT.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I can't get through, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Turn it off. Lay in a course for<br>
    those coordinates, La Forge. Warp<br>
    eight.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir. Plotted and laid in.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Estimated arrival four hours,<br>

    seconds.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Isn't Manheim the one who was<br>
    thrown out of the Institute for<br>
    unauthorized experiments?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Quite the contrary, Commander.<br>
    He left of his own volition.<br>
    Professor Manheim is the most<br>
    highly reputed scientist within<br>
    the Federation. A brilliant<br>
    visionary who...</p>

  <p>3 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD STANDS UP</p>
  <p> and moves to the turbolift.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... Who disappeared over fifteen<br>
    years ago. Along with his wife,<br>
    Laura.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Did you know him, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. He was teaching at the<br>
    University when I was in Paris,<br>
    but I never had the pleasure.<br>
    Number One, you have the Conn.<br>
    Inform me half an hour before we<br>
    reach the coordinates.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD LEAVES</p>
  <p> the bridge.</p>
  <p>4 INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE HOLODECK</p>
  <p> Picard stands there a beat, hesitant to put in the<br>
    program.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Computer, this is Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    What is your pleasure, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Paris. Twenty-two years ago.<br>
    A warm spring day. April ninth.<br>
    Eighteen hundred hours -- three<br>
    o'clock.</p>
  <p>5 INT. HOLODECK</p>
  <p> Paris in the spring. The BIRDS ARE SINGING, BRILLIANT<br>
    LIGHT reflects on the outdoor tables of the Cafe Des<br>
    Artistes. Couples in love complete the ambience.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> THE TABLEAU IS UNMOVING</p>
  <p> until Picard WALKS UP TO a WAITER (EDOUARD).</p>
  <p> WITH GREAT FLOURISH</p>
  <p> the waiter puts himself at Picard's service.</p>
  <p> EDOUARD<br>
    Monsieur, welcome to Cafe Des<br>
    Artistes. Is this your first time<br>
    in Paris?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, I've been here before.</p>
  <p> Picard turns and sees the exact table where he used<br>
    to sit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That table.</p>
  <p> EDOUARD<br>
    Mais oui, we are here to please<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> He ushers Picard to the table on the balcony<br>
    overlooking the city.</p>
  <p> MEMORIES FLOOD PICARD</p>
  <p> as he looks out over the city he loves more than any<br>
    other city in the whole galaxy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've been away far too long.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>6 INT. HOLODECK - PARIS - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY</p>
  <p> Two lovely French girls, just barely nineteen, take<br>
    the table next to Picard. They are very involved in<br>
    their own conversation and take no notice of him.</p>
  <p> PICARD APPRECIATES</p>
  <p> the look and liveliness of the two of them. They too,<br>
    evoke memories. Memories of youth and of love.</p>
  <p> THE WAITER INTERRUPTS</p>
  <p> his reverie with a menu.</p>
  <p> EDOUARD<br>
    Some wine, some cheese, a perfect<br>
    tarte tatin...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm afraid I'm not hungry. I<br>
    really came for the view.</p>
  <p> EDOUARD<br>
    Perhaps what you hunger for is<br>
    not on the menu?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps not. It was many years<br>
    ago, I had a rendezvous -- I was<br>
    to meet someone, a young woman,<br>
    here, at this very table.</p>
  <p> EDOUARD<br>
    She did not come?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know, actually. I've<br>
    always imagined that she did.</p>
  <p> THE WAITER TAKES the menu back, with a knowing<br>
    expression.</p>
  <p> EDOUARD<br>
    You, however, did not. Trust<br>
    Edouard. I will bring something<br>
    special, just for you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ONE OF THE GIRLS</p>
  <p> FRANCINE, stands and throws some money on the table.</p>
  <p> FRANCINE<br>
    I'm not staying if all you're<br>
    going to do is talk about him.</p>
  <p> GABRIELLE<br>
    What is this for?</p>
  <p> FRANCINE<br>
    My lunch. Feed it to the birds.</p>
  <p> FRANCINE LEAVES</p>
  <p> in a swish of silk and color.</p>
  <p> GABRIELLE SIGHS AND STARES</p>
  <p> out over the city, not unlike Picard.</p>
  <p> GABRIELLE<br>
    He will come. He will.</p>
  <p> PICARD HEARS THIS</p>
  <p> and turns his chair so that he can see her more<br>
    clearly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, I'm sure he will.</p>
  <p> GABRIELLE LOOKS AT</p>
  <p> Picard and smiles back at him -- thankful for the<br>
    compliment and for the assurance.</p>
  <p> GABRIELLE<br>
    He's a military man, just like<br>
    you. We're going to get married<br>
    and he's going to stay here in<br>
    Paris and never leave me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He's stationed here?</p>
  <p> GABRIELLE<br>
    Not yet, but that's the way I've<br>
    got it planned. Last night, well,<br>
    after last night, he just couldn't<br>
    leave. He couldn't.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Her eyes fill with tears.</p>
  <p> PICARD CANNOT BEAR</p>
  <p> to see her cry. He wants to make it better somehow.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If he's as young as you are, maybe<br>
    he doesn't know yet exactly what<br>
    he wants to do.</p>
  <p> GABRIELLE<br>
    You're an important Starfleet<br>
    officer -- what would you advise<br>
    my lover to do -- go off and<br>
    explore the galaxy or stay here<br>
    and explore something which has<br>
    no boundaries -- love?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I would tell him that he must be<br>
    the person he is meant to be...<br>
    and that you deserve nothing less<br>
    than that.</p>
  <p> THE WAITER DELIVERS</p>
  <p> a simple tray of various cheeses and meats to Picard.<br>
    He pours himself a glass of deep red wine.</p>
  <p> EDOUARD<br>
    Bordeaux, a very passionate year.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A glass for the young lady.</p>
  <p> The waiter pours a glass of wine for Gabrielle.</p>
  <p> GABRIELLE RISES AND MOVES</p>
  <p> to Picard's table. There is more confidence in her<br>
    demeanor than before. She knows more about this man<br>
    and can deal on a more emotional level.</p>
  <p> GABRIELLE<br>
    Do I remind you of the girl you<br>
    left behind?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. Yes, you do. It's hard to<br>
    say, it has been many years.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> GABRIELLE<br>
    Then you have forgotten her face.</p>
  <p> PICARD STARES THROUGH GABRIELLE</p>
  <p> as if he is directly connected to someone else.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not a single detail. I can see<br>
    every inch of her to this day and<br>
    being here -- I can feel the<br>
    softness of her in the breeze,<br>
    smell the fragrance of her in the<br>
    flowers. I have not forgotten.</p>
  <p> GABRIELLE<br>
    What was her name?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Laura.</p>
  <p> HE STARES OFF</p>
  <p> into the City of Lights, letting the memory of Laura<br>
    wash over him.</p>
  <p>7 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - DAY</p>
  <p> Picard, a little angrier than usual, APPROACHES Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You've been at that console twice<br>
    as long as you estimated.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My estimation was incorrect,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> DATA SWIVELS IN HIS CHAIR</p>
  <p> facing Picard.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And I think it would be best if<br>
    what I am about to tell you were<br>
    also incorrect.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nonsense. Out with it.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Someone, I would assume Professor<br>
    Manheim, opened up a window. A<br>
    window into another dimension.</p>
  <p> Picard strains to garner more information out of what<br>
    little information Data is giving him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You don't know how?</p>
  <p> Data shakes his head &quot;no.&quot;</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You don't know what it is?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What came through this window?</p>
  <p> Data shakes his head &quot;no&quot; again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    A window, that's all you know.</p>
  <p> Data shakes his head &quot;yes.&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, the answers to your questions<br>
    will be the most important<br>
    scientific answers of the<br>
    twenty-fourth century.</p>
  <p> PICARD LOOKS TO THE VIEWSCREEN</p>
  <p> answers, answers, they are all out there.</p>

    Captain, we've reached the<br>
    coordinates specified. There's<br>
    nothing here.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am receiving new coordinates.<br>
    It's a relay signal, the same<br>
    source as the first one.</p>

    Set course for the new<br>
    coordinates.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why would someone make it this<br>
    difficult to find him if he truly<br>
    wants to be found?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A failsafe, I would imagine.</p>

  <p> Everyone is at their post.</p>

    Captain, my sensors are picking<br>
    up what appears to be a small<br>
    planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD NODS</p>
  <p> leaning forward in his chair, trying to get there<br>
    sooner.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge, standard orbit.<br>
    Give me a visual.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Viewscreen on.</p>
  <p>10 MAIN VIEWSCREEN - THE PLANET VANDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> floats VIOLET in space. There is a GLIMMERING EFFECT<br>
    surrounding it.</p>

  <p>11 THE CREW STARES</p>
  <p> at it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There's a forcefield of some kind<br>
    surrounding the planet, sir.</p>

    No, sir.</p>

    Open hailing frequencies.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Hailing frequencies open, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is the USS Enterprise<br>
    responding to your signal for<br>
    help.</p>
  <p> A WOMAN'S VOICE comes through. She is bordering on<br>
    hysteria.</p>
  <p> LAURA (V.O.)<br>
    Help. Please help me. I don't<br>
    know what to do. It's only the<br>
    two of us. He's shaking. Please.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S FACE</p>
  <p> melts a little, just hearing her voice.</p>
  <p> THE CREW LOOKS</p>
  <p> to him to give an order, he is just a small beat slower<br>
    than usual.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you lock onto her coordinates?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No, sir. The forcefield is<br>
    preventing any kind of contact<br>
    other than audio.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mrs. Manheim, this is... the<br>
    captain of the Enterprise. Is<br>
    your husband conscious?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LAURA (V.O.)<br>
    No. You've got to help him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's a force field surrounding<br>
    your planet.</p>
  <p> LAURA (V.O.)<br>
    Yes. I know.</p>
  <p> Picard gently guides a &quot;civilian&quot; through.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good. Then you must be very brave<br>
    and leave his side long enough<br>
    to shut down the system that is<br>
    preventing us from helping you.</p>
  <p> THE PLANET VANDOR</p>
  <p> slowly STOPS SHIMMERING AND BECOMES A CRYSTAL CLEAR<br>
    VIOLET GLOBE.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Good.<br>
    (to crew)<br>
    Lock onto their coordinates and<br>
    beam them up.</p>
  <p> PICARD SITS IN HIS CHAIR</p>
  <p> like the weight of the world has just been placed on<br>
    his shoulders.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'd like extra decontamination<br>
    precautions, Captain.</p>
  <p> Without even moving, Picard responds.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Fine, Number One.</p>
  <p>12 INT. - OUTSIDE THE DE-CONTAMINATION AREA</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker wait outside, Picard nervously shifts<br>
    his weight from foot to foot.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The professor seems to be going<br>
    in and out of consciousness.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, the first time he's &quot;in&quot;<br>
    be sure you find out what the hell<br>
    he was up to down there.</p>
  <p> The Captain paces like a new father.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is anything wrong, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> THE DOOR OPENS</p>
  <p> and a medical team RUSHES OUT with the convulsing body<br>
    of Professor Manheim. Riker FOLLOWS THEM to Sickbay.</p>
  <p> THE CAPTAIN</p>
  <p> stands aside leaving them plenty of room.</p>
  <p> PICARD LOOKS UP</p>
  <p> and standing in the same doorway:</p>
  <p> PICARD'S POV - LAURA</p>
  <p> She looks unearthly, almost like an angel, an even more<br>
    beautiful woman than girl.</p>
  <p> THE TWO OF THEM</p>
  <p> stand staring at one another for a long beat.</p>
  <p> LAURA STEADIES HERSELF</p>
  <p> against the doorway, stunned.</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    Jean-Luc?</p>

  <p> BEVERLY hurriedly takes readings of the uncontrollably<br>
    shaking body of Paul Manheim.</p>
  <p> SHE FINALLY GIVES</p>
  <p> him an injection.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM SHIVERS</p>
  <p> and falls into a deep sleep.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY LOOKS UP</p>
  <p> from her patient to the concerned face of Riker.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's not good.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    When will I be able to question<br>
    him?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't know.</p>
  <p> PICARD AND LAURA ENTER SICKBAY</p>
  <p> and Laura RUSHES TO her husband's side, frightened by<br>
    his stillness.</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    Is he dead?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No. I've sedated him.</p>
  <p> She puts her hand on Laura's shoulder.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'll do everything I can to save<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Doctor, we need to talk to this<br>
    man as soon as we can.</p>
  <p> LAURA STARTS TO CRY</p>
  <p> and Picard puts his arm around her, very affectionately<br>
    comforting her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT ONE 18.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY WATCHES THIS SHOW</p>
  <p> of familiarity and is surprised by it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'll let you know as soon as he<br>
    regains consciousness.</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    Thank you. Thank you, all.</p>
  <p> HER EYES HOLD</p>
  <p> on Picard's and there is much more there than the<br>
    thanks of a woman in distress.</p>
  <p> THE SHIP IS JOLTED</p>
  <p> by a huge BLAST of God only knows what. COLORS flood<br>
    the room.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>15 INT. SICKBAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION</p>
  <p> The crew picks themselves up from the deck.</p>
  <p> PICARD STEADIES</p>
  <p> Laura, then touches his insignia.</p>

    Bridge, Picard. Status report.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Shields are holding, Captain.<br>
    Ten percent loss of power.<br>
    Minimal damage, all decks.</p>
  <p> PICARD IMPATIENTLY</p>
  <p> turns to Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We can't wait for this man to wake<br>
    up to find out what's going on<br>
    here. Clearly, whatever this<br>
    window is, it's still open.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Agreed, Captain. I'll have Data<br>
    start immediately on a thorough<br>
    evaluation of all of Doctor<br>
    Manheim's theories.</p>
  <p> Riker EXITS as</p>
  <p> MANHEIM BEGINS TO GLOW</p>
  <p> shades of VIOLET, the RETURNS to normal. His eyes open<br>
    white and he YELLS OUT:</p>
  <p> MANHEIM<br>
    Head gone. Must fill up. It's<br>
    in the cross!</p>
  <p> LAURA RUSHES TO HIS</p>
  <p> side, REACTING in horror. When she touches him, it<br>
    looks as if he may become coherent, then he fades back<br>
    into convulsions.</p>

  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY GIVES HIM</p>
  <p> another injection. He becomes quiet. Picard turns<br>
    to Laura.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    When did this start?</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    Right before he sent out the<br>
    S.O.S. -- after he -- well, he'd<br>
    been in the lab for at least three<br>
    days.</p>
  <p> PICARD AND BEVERLY</p>
  <p> exchange looks. He turns to Laura, his attitude softer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Laura, I'm afraid I need to ask<br>
    you a number of questions - and<br>
    time is of the essence.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at the two of them.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You can use my office.</p>
  <p> Picard leads Laura to the outer room.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S EYES FOLLOW</p>
  <p> them through the door. She quickly turns back to her<br>
    patient.</p>
  <p>16 INT. SICKBAY - OUTER OFFICE</p>
  <p> Laura and Picard stand and face each other for a long,<br>
    intense moment.</p>
  <p> LAURA SMILES BITTERSWEETLY</p>
  <p> at Picard.</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    This is not how I imagined it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nor I.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    You've done well. Exactly as<br>
    you'd hoped.</p>
  <p> PICARD STRUGGLES</p>
  <p> with his duty -- and his emotions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not exactly. Nothing works just<br>
    as you hope... Laura, I'm sorry<br>
    about your husband.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I need some information from you.</p>
  <p> LAURA SENSES THE</p>
  <p> change in him. She moves back slightly.</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    I don't know what I can tell you,<br>
    Jean-Luc. At best, I'm a<br>
    glorified laboratory assistant.<br>
    Paul's mental capabilities are<br>
    so far beyond yours and mine, he<br>
    couldn't discuss his work with<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But you must know something of<br>
    the nature of his experiments.</p>
  <p> LAURA SHRUGS</p>
  <p> almost indifferent.</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    He lectures me, he practices on<br>
    me, but he doesn't confide in me.<br>
    I stopped listening long ago.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why did he come here? Why Vandor?</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    He said it was because it was far<br>
    enough away, no one would or could<br>
    steal his theories... or stop him<br>
    from trying to prove them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What he was working on is<br>
    unquestionably quite dangerous<br>
    as well as out of control.</p>
  <p> LAURA STARES AT</p>
  <p> Picard as if she's just had a revelation.</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    He's a little like you, Jean-Luc.<br>
    He loves, he needs the challenges<br>
    of the unknown... all I do know<br>
    is that he's been very close to<br>
    a major breakthrough. He's been<br>
    excited and agitated and working<br>
    around the clock for the past few<br>
    months.</p>
  <p> PICARD LOOKS QUESTIONINGLY</p>
  <p> at her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why weren't you affected?</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    Every time he began an experiment,<br>
    he insisted I stay in what he said<br>
    was a protected room. I guess<br>
    he was right.</p>
  <p> PICARD BEGINS TO PACE</p>
  <p> the room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Fifteen years here? By yourself?</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    There was no place left for Paul<br>
    to go -- and I am his wife.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Our destiny isn't always exactly<br>
    what we expect. Isn't that what<br>
    you just said?</p>
  <p> TEARS FORM IN</p>
  <p> Laura's eyes. She begins to feel overwhelmed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD STEPS BACK</p>
  <p> from the emotion.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I must send a team to the planet.</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    You can't. It's protected.<br>
    Paul's made sure no one can get<br>
    in.</p>
  <p> SHE LOOKS UP AT HIM</p>
  <p> and lets the tears come.</p>
  <p> PICARD PUTS HIS ARMS</p>
  <p> around her gently. She collapses into him as if they'd<br>
    never been apart. He holds her sympathetically, as:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY STRIDES INTO</p>
  <p> the office. She stops dead in her tracks and Picard<br>
    lets go of Laura.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Excuse me.</p>
  <p> Laura wipes her tears away and becomes strong again.</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    Is he worse?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He's resting. I'd like to have<br>
    you undergo some tests as well.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY GESTURES TO THE</p>
  <p> Nurse.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    He'll start them.</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    Thank you for your kindness,<br>
    Doctor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> LAURA LOOKS BACK</p>
  <p> at Picard a moment, clasps his hand, then follows the<br>
    Nurse into Sickbay.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY UNCOMFORTABLY</p>
  <p> addresses Picard, all business.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    She's an old friend.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I gathered that. It's her husband<br>
    I'm more concerned with at the<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's his prognosis?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    So far, he's dying and there's<br>
    nothing I can do about it. His<br>
    entire genetic structure is<br>
    altering -- constantly. I don't<br>
    know how or why. I've never<br>
    encountered anything like it<br>
    before.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long does he have?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Maybe a couple of days. It's not<br>
    predictable. All I can do is<br>
    attempt to maintain him until we<br>
    find out what's causing the<br>
    damage.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can I talk to him?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You may never be able to talk to<br>
    him. He may never be coherent<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY STARTS BACK</p>
  <p> into Sickbay.</p>

  <p>16 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor.</p>
  <p> SHE TURNS BACK</p>
  <p> and faces him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I haven't seen Mrs. Manheim since<br>
    Paris.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You needn't explain, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It was a very long time ago.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes. She's a lovely woman.</p>
  <p> She LEAVES Picard, who's feeling very frustrated.</p>
  <p>17 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data is working furiously at the Aft Console when<br>
    Picard ENTERS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Were you able to get any<br>
    information, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD SHAKES HIS</p>
  <p> head.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mrs. Manheim is in the dark about<br>
    her husband's work. And he may<br>
    never come out of the state he's<br>
    in. What have you found out?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sensors show there's an immense<br>
    volume of energy being reflected<br>
    from a small point on the planet's<br>
    surface... near the main<br>
    Laboratory.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Reflecting what?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT TWO 26.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We do not know yet, sir. It<br>
    appears to be moving from a thin<br>
    beam into wider beams and back<br>
    again in an unstructured manner.</p>
  <p> PICARD PUSHES</p>
  <p> him for something more.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is this &quot;beam&quot; responsible for<br>
    the jolt we just felt?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Not directly, sir. It is possible<br>
    the beam is responsible for<br>
    opening the &quot;window.&quot;</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But that's pure assumption. We<br>
    still know virtually nothing about<br>
    Manheim's work.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    About this particular work, sir.<br>
    Professor Manheim is renowned for<br>
    his work in perfecting subspace<br>
    communications, and<br>
    thermodynamics, but those<br>
    particular achievements seem to<br>
    have no bearing on what he is<br>
    trying to do on Vandor.</p>
  <p> PICARD IS</p>
  <p> impatient.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    To the point, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    When he disappeared fifteen years<br>
    ago, he had been working on<br>
    theories of non-linear time. His<br>
    colleagues apparently questioned<br>
    his obsession -- and his<br>
    methodology.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How far did he get?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT TWO 27.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No one knows. He became angry<br>
    about their doubts that he could<br>
    enter other dimensions. He left<br>
    the Institute. That is the last<br>
    anyone heard of him until now.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Can we deal with what's happening<br>
    down there from the ship?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Unlikely. I would need to see<br>
    the Doctor's notes. And even then,<br>
    his mind is of such unparalleled<br>
    brilliance, I am not sure I could<br>
    decipher them.</p>
  <p> PICARD REACTS</p>
  <p> and turns to Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There is an elaborate defense<br>
    system to protect his work.</p>
  <p> WORF STANDS TO</p>
  <p> his full height.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We can get through any system.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's worth a try.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed. Take a small away team.<br>
    See what you can find down there.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Sir, Worf is a warrior. He<br>
    probably confronted his dragon<br>
    and fought with it. Professor<br>
    Manheim also tried to analyze<br>
    whatever it is that comes through<br>
    this window. They were both<br>
    struck down.</p>

    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good, then go over all the<br>
    material that Mister Data collected<br>
    on Manheim's various theories.<br>
    Maybe you'll be able to see<br>
    something that ties in. Something<br>

    I need you to go down to the<br>
    planet and collect my notes, my<br>
    calculations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We intend to. What exactly were<br>
    you working on when this window<br>
    to another dimension was opened?</p>
  <p> MANHEIM IS SHOCKED</p>
  <p> that they even know this much.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM<br>
    How were you able to determine<br>
    that?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are not totally without<br>
    resources.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM<br>
    I'll speak to the Science Officer.</p>

    I have spent the last twenty years<br>

  <p> Data is impressed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I suspected it but I could not<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    What about time/gravity?</p>
  <p> MANHEIM'S<br>
    It's all in my notes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'd rather hear it from you<br>
    personally, a condensed version.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM<br>
    There is hardly a condensed<br>
    version of the most complex theory<br>
    of the twenty-fourth century,<br>
    Captain Picard, but if you insist,<br>
    I'll attempt one that even you<br>
    will be able to understand.</p>
  <p> PICARD WANTS TO KNOCK</p>
  <p> this guy right out of Sickbay and back out in space,<br>
    but he controls himself.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM<br>
    A star four light years away went<br>
    nova. I have been able to<br>
    mathematically... &quot;latch&quot; onto<br>
    the incredible gravity of this<br>
    smooth back globe and direct that<br>
    energy, that nearly immeasurable<br>
    force, into space.</p>
  <p> DATA IS TRANSFIXED</p>
  <p> by the pure simplicity of it all -- even though he<br>
    realizes this is like a grain of sand to the whole<br>
    theory.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So -- this energy, directed into<br>
    space, then what?</p>
  <p> MANHEIM<br>
    Then, abracadabra, Captain Picard,<br>
    we all see God! A window to<br>
    another dimension, isn't that how<br>
    you put it? So pedestrian.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Fine. My scientific knowledge<br>
    isn't the issue here -- yours is.<br>
    You opened it. Are you brilliant<br>
    enough to close it?</p>
  <p> MANHEIM LOOKS AT</p>
  <p> Picard and starts to laugh.</p>
  <p> THE LAUGH BECOMES HYSTERICAL</p>
  <p> and Beverly quickly moves to Manheim's side to<br>
    administer a shot.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM GRABS HER WRIST</p>

    floor.</p>
  <p> DATA AND PICARD</p>

    unseen BLAST OF ENERGY emanating from him.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM<br>
    Give me thirty cc's of trisinov.<br>
    I'll give you the correct<br>
    coordinates to beam safely to<br>

  <p> ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>25 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around Vandor</p>
  <p>26 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Beverly is checking Paul's vital signs when he drifts<br>
    into consciousness. He stares at her intently for a<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM<br>
    Who are you?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm Doctor Crusher and I'm trying...</p>
  <p> MANHEIM<br>
    Imposter! Touch me and you touch<br>
    whatever your head can't<br>
    understand. I am real. You are<br>
    illusion.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Try to rest.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM<br>
    I am rest. I am action. I am you.<br>
    Imposter.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM LAPSES BACK</p>
  <p> into a fevered fitful sleep.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I wish I could talk to you --<br>
    Professor Manheim. I bet you were<br>
    really something.</p>
  <p> TROI QUIETLY ENTERS</p>
  <p> Sickbay. Beverly is surprised to see her and joins<br>
    her at the door.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Deanna?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I wanted to see how he was doing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The same. Nothing I do seems to<br>
    make any difference.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY SMILES</p>
  <p> at Troi.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's not why you're here.</p>
  <p> TROI SHAKES</p>
  <p> her head &quot;no.&quot;</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm supposed to be the empath.</p>
  <p> Beverly gestures her to follow her to the outer office.</p>
  <p>27 INT. SICKBAY - DR. CRUSHER'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Beverly keeps working as Troi talks to her.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Are you all right?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Why wouldn't I be? I've got one<br>
    of the medical wonders of the<br>
    galaxy dying in my Sickbay.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That isn't what I meant.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't think I want to talk about<br>
    what I think you mean.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY BUMPS INTO</p>
  <p> a table and pushes it out of the way as she continues<br>
    to work.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're not helping the situation<br>
    by pretending it doesn't exist.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY WHIRLS AROUND</p>
  <p> almost knocking a tube off the table.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm making it worse?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I didn't say that. I said you're<br>
    not helping it. Or yourself.<br>
    Or the captain.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's his problem.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY MOVES THINGS</p>
  <p> from place to place. Troi calmly looks at her, willing<br>
    her to stand still.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    All right. I'm still not sure<br>
    how I feel about him. Now it<br>
    looks as if I'll never know...<br>
    are you happy? I said it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Talk to him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No. I can't compete with a ghost<br>
    from his past. No one could.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    She's not a ghost. She's here<br>
    right now.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    She may be in the here and now,<br>
    but it's the ghost he sees. No<br>
    Deanna, he'll have to work it<br>
    through without my... input.</p>
  <p> SHE SLAMS A PIECE</p>
  <p> of equipment back into its place.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There. Now I feel better.<br>
    thanks, Deanna.</p>
  <p> TROI STARES KNOWINGLY AFTER</p>
  <p> Beverly as she WALKS BACK into Sickbay.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>28 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard impatiently taps his fingers on the command<br>
    chair. Data pores over his console as Riker watches.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How soon, Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am almost through comparing the<br>
    calculations, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD IS STARTLED</p>
  <p> when Beverly's voice comes through.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Bridge, this is Sickbay. Doctor<br>
    Manheim is awake and asking to<br>
    speak with you, Captain. Alone.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On my way, Doctor.</p>
  <p> HE JUMPS UP</p>
  <p> from the Command Chair and HURRIES TOWARDS the<br>
    turbolift.</p>
  <p> RIKER AND DATA</p>
  <p> return to their calculations. Data finishes and looks<br>
    at Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Can we do it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe so. But it must be<br>
    soon. Sensors indicate a rapid<br>
    deterioration of the atmosphere.</p>
  <p> RIKER LOOKS AT</p>
  <p> Data. He'd like a little more assurance.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I cannot be more sure than that,<br>
    Commander. Not until I see what<br>
    is in Professor Manheim's<br>
    laboratory.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Okay. Let's get ready. Worf.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT FOUR 48.</p>
  <p>29 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS, not having any idea what he'll find.<br>
    Beverly gestures to Manheim.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM IS SITTING</p>
  <p> up, conscious, but battling with an unseen enemy.</p>
  <p> PICARD WALKS BRISKLY</p>
  <p> to his bedside.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You asked for me.</p>
  <p> Manheim struggles to make sense.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM<br>
    You belong with Laura. It's the<br>
    way it's supposed to be. Give<br>
    me your word you'll take care of<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> PICARD IS FURIOUS</p>
  <p> at the arrogance of this man. And he's feeling a<br>
    little guilty too.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I did not come here to discuss<br>
    her. I will not discuss her with<br>
    you until your irresponsible<br>
    actions are checked and until my<br>
    away team is back on this ship<br>
    safe and sound.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM'S FEVERED EYES</p>
  <p> bore into the captain.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM<br>
    It is only Laura who concerns me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then she is wrong. We are very<br>
    different, you and I. For which<br>
    I am grateful.</p>
  <p> PICARD STRIDES TOWARDS</p>
  <p> the door.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM<br>
    Good. You will take care of her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT FOUR 49.</p>
  <p>30 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi is at the controls this time as the three away<br>
    Team members STEP ONTO the pad. They carry very small,<br>
    portable respirator packs on their chests.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I have the coordinates exactly<br>
    in the corridor the Professor<br>
    specified.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're ready.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Good luck.</p>
  <p> Geordi operates the controls and the away team BEAMS<br>
    DOWN.</p>
  <p>31 INT. VANDOR - CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the away team BEAMS IN. It is DARK and they<br>
    immediately feel the difference in atmosphere.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Respirators on.</p>
  <p> They turn their packs on and move as quickly as they<br>
    can, Worf in the lead, towards the laboratory door.</p>
  <p> SUDDENLY ANOTHER STRONG</p>
  <p> burst of ENERGY BLASTS THROUGH THE CORRIDOR, sending<br>
    the away team flying and ROLLING to safety.</p>
  <p> The corridor PULSATES WITH THE VIOLET COLORS of the<br>
    other dimension.</p>
  <p>32 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> WAVES OF COLOR RADIATE OFF THE ENTERPRISE.</p>
  <p>33 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The bridge crew holds its own against the assault.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Shields barely holding, sir.<br>
    Damage reports coming in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Contact the away team!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT FOUR 50.</p>
  <p>34 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Laura is at the side of her husband, trying to hold<br>
    him down, trying to will him to be well. With every<br>
    assault, he too is assaulted.</p>
  <p>35 INT. VANDOR - CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The onslaught over, the away team cautiously makes its<br>
    way towards Manheim's laboratory.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Maintain an open frequency, Number<br>
    One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Frequency open, sir.</p>
  <p> NEXT TO THE LABORATORY</p>
  <p> Data removes a panel next to the door, and begins to<br>
    insert the code Manheim gave them. Worf watches the<br>
    corridor carefully.</p>
  <p> DATA FINISHES ENTERING</p>
  <p> the code and the lab doors OPEN partially.</p>
  <p> SUDDENLY WORF NOTICES</p>
  <p> several openings along the edges of the wall.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Look out!</p>
  <p> THE THREE DIVE</p>
  <p> for cover as LASER FIRE COMMENCES.</p>
  <p> THEY ROLL BACK AND FORTH</p>
  <p> out of range of attack.</p>
  <p> ALL THREE PULL</p>
  <p> their phasers and RETURN FIRE to the source of the<br>
    attacks.</p>
  <p> QUIET SETTLES</p>
  <p> in the corridor. The away team cautiously pick<br>
    themselves up.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT FOUR 51.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Manheim forgot to mention that<br>
    one.</p>
  <p> THEY LOOK AT EACH</p>
  <p> other and allow themselves a slight REACTION.</p>
  <p> THE THREE OF THEM SQUEEZE</p>
  <p> through the narrow opening into the darkness of the<br>
    lab.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>36 INT. VANDOR - MANHEIM'S LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS ACTION</p>
  <p> Data touches a wallplate and the LIGHTS GO ON. His<br>
    eye is immediately attracted to an instrument panel<br>
    -- a floating RED LIGHT, a small board of numbers, a<br>
    narrow slot and a clock.</p>
  <p> THE CLOCK COUNTS DOWN</p>
  <p> the micro-seconds... starting from ten minutes.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Hopefully, an easily deactivated<br>
    alarm system.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    More surprises.</p>
  <p> DATA IS ALREADY</p>
  <p> examining the board. He sticks his hand in the slot<br>
    and the seconds keep on disappearing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, a problem with Manheim's<br>
    security. Any chance he's awake?</p>
  <p>37 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (INTERCUT AS NEEDED)</p>
  <p> Picard and Troi REACT.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, Commander. Doctor Crusher<br>
    is under orders to inform me if<br>
    the professor regains<br>
    consciousness.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    What's the problem?</p>
  <p> DATA FINISHES TAKING</p>
  <p> his readings and turns to Riker.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Professor Manheim's state of<br>
    consciousness is of little use<br>
    to us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Explain.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It appears, sir, he was more<br>
    interested in making certain his<br>
    notes were destroyed than in<br>
    our safety. When we came into<br>
    the lab we triggered an explosive<br>
    device. In less than ten minutes<br>
    the lab and whoever is in it will<br>
    cease to exist.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'd like to wake him up myself.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Do not bother, sir. Manheim<br>
    himself could not stop this. It<br>
    is deactivated by a photogenetic<br>
    code. Manheim's is altered.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    My suggestion is to continue the<br>
    mission posthaste.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You've got seven minutes. I don't<br>
    care what you've found or what<br>
    you're doing, clear?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir. Worf check the outer<br>
    perimeter -- carefully. And<br>
    Data...</p>
  <p> DATA IS ALREADY</p>
  <p> immersed in the computer. His face shows the magnitude<br>
    of what he's learning and the respect he has fo this<br>
    knowledge.</p>
  <p> THE COMPUTER SCREEN</p>
  <p> speeds through Manheim's notes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Truly incredible.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>38 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Geordi reports to Picard.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sir, the sensor findings from the<br>
    last blast are in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They're different from all<br>
    previous waves.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In magnitude, in energy mass, in<br>
    composition?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    In every way, sir. It would seem<br>
    we are dealing with something<br>
    that's not even remotely easy to<br>
    classify. We might sit here for<br>
    the next hundred years being<br>
    blasted daily, and no two blasts<br>
    would be the same.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Anything could happen. We're<br>
    dealing with another dimension.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you saying it could<br>
    arbitrarily, or even with fine<br>
    methodology, change direction and<br>
    instead of blasting us, draw us<br>
    in... suck us through the window?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That would certainly be a viable<br>
    possibility, sir. One of<br>
    trillions.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    With so much to fear, there is<br>
    truly nothing to do but remain<br>
    calm.</p>
  <p>39 INT. VANDOR - MANHEIM'S LABORATORY</p>
  <p> The clock shows seven minutes and a few seconds.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA CALMLY WORKS</p>
  <p> at the computer. Worf and Riker stand by... not so<br>
    calmly.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is the only chance we have.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What is?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A reversal of the same effect<br>
    Doctor Manheim has programmed into<br>
    the computer.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    How?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is no time to reprogram.<br>
    You will need to physically change<br>
    microchips the same time I program<br>
    the correct instructions here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, we have a plan.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Proceed, and report at regular<br>
    intervals.</p>
  <p> DATA IS UP AND OPENS</p>
  <p> two steel doors electronically.</p>
  <p> THEY ENTER A SILO-TYPE</p>
  <p> structure. The walls are perfectly smooth.<br>
    Occasionally brooken by small grill work, shielding the<br>
    guts of the machinery.</p>
  <p> DATA POINTS UP</p>
  <p> to the top of the twenty foot structure.</p>
  <p> THEIR POV - UP</p>
  <p> to the very top.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA (O.S.)<br>
    Someone must climb to the top.<br>
    The circuits we need to change<br>
    are in that panel.</p>
  <p> RIKER AND WORF</p>
  <p> look at one another... both of them are suffering from<br>
    the lack of oxygen and yet both of them want to go.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Whoever goes will be in more<br>
    danger than falling. A great heat<br>
    is generated in this chamber.<br>
    Enough to disintegrate any of us<br>
    in seconds.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What about the doors, the ones<br>
    we came in? If they stay open,<br>
    would the system short out? Heat<br>
    of that magnitude requires a seal<br>
    of some sort, doesn't it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We cannot do it electronically.<br>
    I need to use full power to<br>
    reverse the effect.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will keep the doors from<br>
    closing.</p>
  <p> THEY PREPARE TO EXECUTE</p>
  <p> the plan.</p>
  <p> THE CLOCK NOW READS</p>
  <p> less than five minutes.</p>
  <p> RIKER TAKES HIGH-TECH CLIMBING GEAR</p>
  <p> out of his chest pack. He ENTERS the cylinder.</p>
  <p> WORF READIES HIMSELF</p>
  <p> between the steel doors, summoning all the Klingon<br>
    strength of the ages.</p>

  <p> like a church organist ready to play for the coronation<br>
    of the pope.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    He's past the halfway mark.</p>

  <p> on the wall of the cylinder.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, I need more time.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>

    He's almost there.</p>
  <p> WORF PRESSES HIS MASSIVE</p>

  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA TOUCHES A BUTTON</p>
  <p> on the panel and the SOUND OF MACHINERY coming to life<br>
    fills the lab.</p>
  <p> WORF STRAINS WITH EVERY CELL</p>
  <p> in his body to hold the doors open.</p>
  <p> RIKER REACHES THE TOP</p>
  <p> and barely has the breath to speak, but manages:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Go, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA BEGINS THE PROGRAM</p>
  <p> and calmly touches his insignia and speaks to Riker.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Remember Commander -- it is the<br>
    blue chip you switch with the<br>
    yellow chip.</p>
  <p> WORF STRAINS, SWEAT</p>

  <p> with purpose as a BLAST of hot air WHOOSHES past him<br>
    and through the lab.</p>
  <p> OUTSIDE THE LAB</p>
  <p> a BEAM OF LIGHT starts from high up in the sky and is<br>
    drawn to the tip of the cylinder.</p>

    exuberant with the feeling of brotherhood.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Did it work?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is well patched... Closed in<br>
    this sense would be an equation...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Patched is good enough.</p>

  <p> Paul Manheim is sitting straight up in bed and he is<br>
    a new man, completely different in demeanor and look<br>
    than ever before.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But this is amazing. All your<br>

  <p> PICARD AND LAURA ENTER</p>
  <p> Sickbay at the same time.</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    Paul?</p>
  <p> MANHEIM<br>
    The effect has been reversed,<br>
    darling. It's safe now.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She RUSHES TO HIM and is genuinely happy to see that<br>
    he is going to be all right.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There are no residual effects.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM TURNS TO BEVERLY</p>
  <p> and gentlemanly corrects her.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM<br>
    No, Doctor, I am not the same man<br>
    I was before.</p>
  <p> He holds his wife to him.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I still have the same vision, but,<br>
    Captain Picard, I would like to<br>
    request a science team to help<br>
    me rebuild. I would like to start<br>
    fresh, and do everything the right<br>
    way this time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure the Federation will want<br>
    to help you in any way they can,<br>
    as long as you are willing to now<br>
    be a part of the Federation.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM NODS</p>
  <p> and strokes Laura's hand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The science team will be arranged.</p>
  <p> MANHEIM<br>
    All volunteers, I insist. No one<br>
    on Vandor will be there unless<br>
    they want to be there.</p>
  <p> He looks at Laura and Laura looks from this great,<br>
    great man, who has just become even greater to...</p>
  <p> PICARD WATCHING HER</p>
  <p> with an understanding look.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>43 INT. HOLODECK</p>
  <p> Jean-Luc Picard sits at the same table in the same cafe<br>
    in Paris. He sips a glass of red wine.</p>
  <p> LAURA WALKS INTO</p>
  <p> the picture.</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    I hope you don't mind. I<br>
    convinced the technician you<br>
    wouldn't.</p>
  <p> PICARD TURNS TO HER</p>
  <p> and stands, offering her a chair.</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    Oh, no, I won't be staying.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know.</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    I wanted to say good-bye here,<br>
    not in the Transporter Room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You have more courage than I did.</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    More courage than a young man in<br>
    first love, yes. More courage<br>
    than Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of<br>
    the USS Enterprise -- I doubt<br>
    there are many who could boast<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> HE STANDS AND HOLDS HER</p>
  <p> in the warmest embrace... one that he will treasure<br>
    through the decades, an embrace of the deepest kind<br>
    of love.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I eat, sleep and dream your<br>
    softness -- could it be enough?</p>
  <p> LAURA<br>
    We would have been the richest,<br>
    most gloriously happy two people<br>
    in all the worlds.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SHE TURNS TO GO</p>
  <p> and doesn't look back.</p>
  <p> PICARD WATCHES HER LEAVE</p>
  <p> memorizing her step, everything about her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I cannot say good-bye to you.</p>
  <p>44 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker, Troi, Data, Geordi and Worf are all on the<br>
    bridge.</p>
  <p> THE CAPTAIN ENTERS</p>
  <p> and they all look at Picard as if they are slightly<br>
    worried about him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is anything wrong?</p>
  <p> Everyone goes about their business.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then set course for Sarona Eight.<br>
    As I remember we were on our way<br>
    for some much needed R and R.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir. Course set and laid in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Warp five. Engage.</p>
  <p> GEORDI MAKES THE</p>
  <p> necessary computations.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've only been there once, but<br>
    there's this great bar -- I can't<br>
    remember the name of it, they<br>
    serve these blue concoctions...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Paris&quot; - 2/22/88 - ACT FIVE 63.</p>
  <p>44 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    ... It's across the square from<br>
    the Zanza Men's Dance Palace.</p>
  <p> They both look at her. Troi half-smiles.</p>
  <p> PICARD LOOKS FORWARD</p>
  <p> into his future without Laura, the future that begins<br>
    on Sarona 8. He turns to Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's called the Blue Parrot Cafe<br>
    -- and you're buying.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
