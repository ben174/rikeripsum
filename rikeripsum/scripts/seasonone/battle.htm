    &quot;The Battle&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND FERENGI VESSEL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the two starships cruise through space together.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 41723.9.<br>
    In response to a Starfleet order<br>
    we are in the Xendi Sabu star<br>
    system having rendezvoused with<br>
    a Ferengi vessel which has<br>
    requested a meeting. Although...</p>
  <p>2 CLOSER ON STARFLEET AND FERENGI VESSELS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> emphasizing the difference between the two.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... we arrived here and made<br>
    appropriate signals to the Ferengi<br>
    three days ago, they have so far<br>
    responded only with the message:<br>
    &quot;Stand by, Enterprise.&quot;</p>
  <p>3 INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD at his desk, star charts on a nearby monitor.<br>
    He's in some physical discomfort, presses his knuckles<br>
    to his temple, GROANS. We HEAR a CHIME from his door.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come!</p>
  <p> The door opens; BEVERLY ENTERS. She carries a medical<br>
    kit.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You called for me?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Doctor. I've been feeling...<br>
    odd, lately. Fatigued. And now<br>
    I've got a headache.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Battle&quot; - 9/14/87 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Unslinging her medical kit, Beverly looks up, surprised.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    A what?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Certainly you know what a<br>
    &quot;headache&quot; is, Doctor.</p>
  <p> Beverly is already beginning to move a medical tricorder<br>
    sensor over Picard's head. WE HEAR it FAINTLY BEEPING<br>
    as she checks readings she is getting.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Of course. But I don't often<br>
    encounter one.</p>
  <p> She makes an adjustment on the tricorder, gets HUM SOUND<br>
    as she takes another kind of reading.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The reason for it seems fairly<br>
    obvious. What are these Ferengi<br>
    up to? &quot;Stand by, Enterprise.&quot;<br>
    Stand by for what?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can't find a thing wrong.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can't either. But they could<br>
    be baiting some kind of trap...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    With your head. I see nothing<br>
    physically wrong, but I want to<br>
    run additional scans in Sickbay.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor, all I've got is...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    ... is an order to report to<br>
    Sickbay.<br>
    (friendly smile)<br>
    From the one person aboard who can<br>
    give you an order.</p>
  <p> Picard hesitates, then smiles and nods, starts to rise.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Battle&quot; - 9/14/87 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain from first officer.<br>
    They're finally sending a message.</p>
  <p> Picard comes fully to his feet, touching his insignia.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On my way, Number One.<br>
    (CROSSING to door)<br>
    Sorry, Doctor. Duty calls.</p>
  <p>4 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> RIKER, TROI, DATA, GEORDI, TASHA, and WORF are at their<br>
    usual stations. Picard ENTERS JOINING Riker at the<br>
    Command Area. The Main Viewer displays the Ferengi<br>
    vessel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They're prepared to talk, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Have they given any hint what<br>
    they've been waiting for?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Negative on that, Captain. But<br>
    they have identified their Captain<br>
    as &quot;Bok,&quot; DaiMon Bok.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If it's Bok I'm sensing, he seems<br>
    anxious to meet you, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Me? Why me? I've never heard<br>
    of him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You'll be able to see him now,<br>
    sir. They're willing to<br>
    communicate on visual.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A reminder of something we learned<br>
    the only other time we dealt with<br>
    Ferengi, sir -- their hearing is<br>
    very sensitive.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Battle&quot; - 9/14/87 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Yes, they could pick up even a<br>
    whisper being transmitted.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Consider ourselves reminded.<br>
    (to Tasha)<br>
    Open hailing frequencies.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Hailing frequencies open, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ferengi vessel! This is Captain<br>
    Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise.<br>
    We are transmitting visually.</p>
  <p> A beat, then the Main Viewer DISSOLVES INTO a FULL FRAME<br>
    HEAD SHOT of DAIMON BOK, brightly lit, distorted. He's<br>
    smoothly patronizing, clipped in speech, and arrogant.<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    Is this THE Captain Picard?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do we know each other?</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    I know you, Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm afraid you have the advantage.<br>
    Is this... Bok?</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    I am Bok, DaiMon of the Ferengi.<br>
    I have asked you here to discuss<br>
    a mutual problem, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What problem is that, DaiMon Bok?</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    I insist on speaking of that<br>
    matter in person. Shall we meet<br>
    on your vessel or mine?</p>
  <p> Troi signals Tasha who touches her panel.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Battle&quot; - 9/14/87 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Hailing frequencies closed.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, I sense considerable<br>
    deception on Bok's part. And<br>
    danger!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then definitely, sir, you should<br>
    meet with him here. Keep him<br>
    under our control.</p>
  <p> Picard nods, turns and signals to Tasha who touches her<br>
    panel again.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Now open, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (toward Viewscreen)<br>
    I appreciate your offer, DaiMon<br>
    Bok, and ask you to be our guests.</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    As you wish, Picard. Perhaps this<br>
    will begin a new era of<br>
    cooperation for both our peoples.<br>
    In one Earth hour, then?</p>
  <p> Everyone on the bridge is stunned by the unexpected<br>
    concession.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    One hour, Bok. End transmission.</p>
  <p> The viewer CLEARS BACK to the Ferengi ship. The<br>
    Enterprise bridge crew reacts.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I can't believe they're coming<br>
    here!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (turns to Troi)<br>
    They agreed a bit too easily.</p>
  <p> Troi nods.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Battle&quot; - 9/14/87 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing; nods back)<br>
    Then, in one hour we'll know why.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Battle&quot; - 9/14/87 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>5 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Beverly is using twenty-fourth century diagnostic tools to<br>
    examine the prone Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you accustomed to always<br>
    getting your way, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (nods)<br>
    When my way makes sense, Captain.<br>
    There are still forty minutes<br>
    before the Ferengi beam over; I'll<br>
    have these scans done in ten.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A lot of effort for something as<br>
    simple as a headache.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    &quot;As simple?&quot; It is my job to know<br>
    your condition intimately. You<br>
    should not have a headache unless<br>
    something is wrong.</p>
  <p> She is clearly puzzled over finding nothing. She makes<br>
    a new setting on the scanner.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It may be true that headaches were<br>
    once quite common... but this was<br>
    in the days before the brain was<br>
    charted...<br>
    (very puzzled; a new<br>
    setting)<br>
    ... before we understood the nature<br>
    of pain... when we were suffering<br>
    from such things as the common<br>
    cold.</p>
  <p> She swings the &quot;scanner&quot; away from Picard. He half<br>
    rises.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And so why do I have a headache,<br>
    Doctor?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Battle&quot; - 9/14/87 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I haven't the slightest damned<br>
    idea!</p>
  <p> She picks up a tiny device, turns it on and WE HEAR a<br>
    light HUM from it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's that?</p>
  <p> She presses it against his forehead. The light HUM<br>
    becomes SHRILLER.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Something doctors use when they<br>
    feel foolish over being proven<br>
    wrong.<br>
    (takes device away)<br>
    Feel better?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    The pain's gone.</p>
  <p> She turns the device OFF, puts it aside.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Medical fakery -- the pain's<br>
    actually still there, just<br>
    cloaked. I'll want further exams<br>
    when this Ferengi matter is<br>
    settled.</p>
  <p>6 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Troi, Data, Geordi, Tasha and Worf on duty as<br>
    WESLEY ARRIVES by turbolift, hurriedly addresses Riker:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Sir! You'll soon be getting an<br>
    intruder alert!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What? Wesley, if you've something<br>
    to report...</p>
  <p> But Wesley has hurried toward Geordi, interrupting:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Battle&quot; - 9/14/87 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    If you'll scan heading four-four<br>
    mark one-six-three, Lieutenant,<br>
    you'll find...</p>
  <p> INTRUDER ALERT SIGNAL sounds, Tasha reacting, turning<br>
    to Riker:</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Intruder alert, sir...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (reading his panel)<br>
    I've got something, sir... very<br>
    distant.</p>
  <p> Turbolift opens TO BRING Picard onto the bridge,<br>
    unnoticed by most as Tasha silences the ALERT and Wesley<br>
    turns to Riker.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's an old style starship,<br>
    Constitution Class, heading this<br>
    way under impulse power, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Says who?</p>
  <p> Picard moves in to Command Area. Conversation DIES as<br>
    he takes his seat there.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Carry on.<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    Answer the first officer's<br>
    question.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Uh... says the long distance<br>
    sensors, sir. I was in<br>
    Engineering, playing around with<br>
    boosting sensor output...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (interrupting; smiling)<br>
    Very interesting. Boosting it<br>
    how?<br>
    (seeing Picard's look;<br>
    to Wesley)<br>
    We will discuss it later.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Battle&quot; - 9/14/87 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    I read it now, sir, as... a<br>
    Constitution Class starship...<br>
    coming this way under impulse<br>
    power.</p>
  <p> Exactly as Wesley described it minutes before. Picard<br>
    suddenly grimaces, a wave of pain catching him by<br>
    surprise and he has to suppress a surprised GROAN and<br>
    finds it necessary to again press a knuckle against his<br>
    forehead for a moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sir? What's wrong?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (fighting it off)<br>
    Nothing, just... a mild headache.<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    The correct procedure, Ensign,<br>
    would have been to signal your<br>
    finding to the bridge immediately.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Bringing it here personally...<br>
    (indicates Main Viewer)<br>
    ... perhaps with the idea of being<br>
    on hand for the Ferengi beam<br>
    over... might have imperiled our<br>
    ship had something hostile been<br>
    approaching.</p>
  <p> Wesley has thrown Picard a nervous look at Riker's guess<br>
    that the Ferengi beam over was his motive.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are receiving no signal at all<br>
    from the approaching starship,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Time, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Battle&quot; - 9/14/87 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Time? Oh, for the Ferengi to beam<br>
    over.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Do you see any problems connected<br>
    with this old starship coming in?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Suggest we'll be safer, sir, with<br>
    the Ferengi over here whatever<br>
    is happening.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Concur.<br>
    (to bridge)<br>
    Stand by!<br>
    (to Tasha)<br>
    Let's bring them on visually.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Hailing frequencies open, sir.</p>
  <p>7 ANOTHER ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Enterprise to Ferengi vessel.<br>
    We are standing by to receive you.</p>
  <p> The Ferengi vessel IMAGE on Main Viewer DISSOLVES INTO<br>
    IMAGE OF BOK, being joined by KAZAGO, First Officer,<br>
    and RATA, Second Officer.</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    Ready to transfer ourselves over,<br>
    my dear Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Question... where shall we receive<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    On your own bridge, of course.<br>
    Ferengi efficiency!</p>
  <p> With a FERENGI LIGHT SWIRL BEAMING EFFECT, the three<br>
    Ferengi figures FADE OUT OF SIGHT. The Main Viewer<br>
    IMAGE DISSOLVES TO THE FERENGI SHIP IMAGE AGAIN.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Battle&quot; - 9/14/87 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>8 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the Enterprise bridge crew waits, but nothing happens<br>
    for awhile. Finally:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data? What do you read?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Nothing, sir.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It could take a few moments,<br>
    Captain. If they build up their<br>
    beaming energy through capacitors<br>
    as seems likely...</p>
  <p> Then, FERENGI BEAMING EFFECT STARTS WITH SOUND --<br>

    SHIP. It solidifies into BOK, KAZAGO, and RATA.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We welcome you in peace to the<br>
    Enterprise, DaiMon Bok.</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    (ingratiating)<br>
    It is our pleasure, Captain<br>
    Picard. Might I introduce my<br>
    first officer, Kazago, and my<br>
    second, Rata?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods to acknowledge)<br>
    This is my first officer,<br>
    Commander Riker...<br>
    (Bok nods)<br>
    And Counselor Troi. Second<br>
    Officer Data; Lieutenant La Forge;<br>
    security officers, Lieutenant Yar<br>
    and Lieutenant Worf; Ensign<br>
    Crusher.</p>
  <p> Bok has squinted hard at Troi and Tasha.</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    Yes, we have heard you use<br>
    females...<br>
    (checks them again)<br>
    Clothed females. Most<br>
    interesting.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    They are that, sir.</p>

  <p> Kazago now turns to scrutinize Data.</p>
  <p> KAZAGO<br>
    And the android was mentioned too.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    What is its price? We should like<br>
    to purchase it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It... he is not for sale.<br>
    Commander Data is...is...</p>
  <p> Made uncomfortable by this, Picard seeks the right<br>
    words. Riker fills in:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You wouldn't want him, Kazago.<br>
    He's second-hand merchandise.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (rises)<br>
    Second-hand, sir?<br>
    (then sees Riker's<br>
    smile)<br>
    Oh, of course! A human joke...</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Excuse, Captain, but the<br>
    unidentified starship is<br>
    continuing in, still no signal<br>
    at all...</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    Think nothing of it.. It is under<br>
    our control.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (alert)<br>
    One of our starships under your<br>
    control?</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    Do not be alarmed. It is a gift<br>
    from us.<br>
    (slight bow to Picard)<br>
    With which we honor the &quot;Hero of<br>
    Maxia.&quot;</p>

    Why you, Picard, of course! Don't<br>
    you remember the Battle of Maxia?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry, I'm afraid I do not.<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> As the android searches his own memory, Bok is visibly<br>
    disturbed at Picard's lack of memory.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, he may refer to an<br>
    incident which occurred seven<br>
    years ago in the Maxia Zeta star<br>
    system, where an unidentified<br>
    starship...</p>

    Unidentified?! That fine vessel<br>
    was Ferengi!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Which you destroyed, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (turns to Bok)<br>
    My sincere regrets, Bok, but that<br>
    ship did not identify itself.<br>
    It simply attacked; we defended<br>
    ourselves...</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Such mistakes happen in space.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Hardly a &quot;mistake,&quot; sir. Your<br>
    report showed it deliberately<br>
    attacked...</p>
  <p> Picard is signaling Data to forget it:</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Do you want the arriving vessel<br>
    on Main Viewer, sir? It is only<br>
    a thousand kilometers away now...</p>

    For what purpose? What is this<br>

  <p> Picard's headache comes back, striking him hard this<br>
    time. He GROANS, surprised, presses hard on his own<br>
    temples. Troi comes to her feet, alarmed.</p>

    I felt something too, Captain.<br>
    What is it?</p>

    What is this all about?</p>

    It is about the battle I<br>
    mentioned, Captain. A gift in<br>

    Enlarge please, La Forge.</p>
  <p> On Main Viewer, the IMAGE MAGNIFIES into closer view.<br>
    Picard is mesmerized by what he is seeing -- and<br>
    recognizing. Bok is amused by this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It... it is the Stargazer. My old<br>
    ship, but how... where did you find<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    It was a derelict, adrift in space<br>
    on the far side of this star<br>
    system. How it got there...<br>
    (grand gesture)<br>
    ... is none of my business,<br>
    Captain. But now that vessel is<br>
    yours, if you wish to have it.</p>

    Something's burning... I smell<br>

    We were traveling at warp two<br>
    through the Maxia Zeta star system<br>
    when an unidentified starship<br>
    suddenly appeared and fired on<br>
    us! From close range.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where did it come from?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It must've been lying in a deep<br>
    moon crater nearby. The first<br>
    attack damaged our shields, and<br>
    in the confusion it hit us a<br>
    second time.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No clue who they were?</p>

    Ah... my weapons officer on the<br>

    (weak smile)<br>

    Then, with your shields failing,<br>
    sir...</p>

    coming in for the kill...<br>

    and when it went into its return<br>

    ... you performed what Starfleet<br>
    textbooks now call &quot;The Picard<br>
    Maneuver.&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What any good helmsman could have<br>
    done. I dropped into high warp...<br>
    (with his hands)<br>
    ... then stopped right off the<br>
    target vessel's bow...<br>
    (slaps hands together)<br>
    ... and fired everything I had.</p>

    By blowing into warp speed, you<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Very well, Data.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    How was it, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (distant)<br>
    Strange, Number One. Like<br>
    visiting the house you grew up<br>
    in, but no one's home, except the<br>
    phantoms of the past...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It has troubled you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not as much as this damn headache,<br>
    Counselor. Take over, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS. Riker exchanges a concerned look with<br>

    but immediately the voices STOP.</p>
  <p>30 INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker waiting while Data closes the door. He offers<br>
    the nearby monitor to Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What is it, Data? Why all the<br>
    mystery?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is the records of the Stargazer,<br>
    sir. What the Ferengi call the<br>
    &quot;Battle of Maxia&quot;...<br>
    (using monitor)<br>
    It seems the Captain's personal<br>
    log contains a much different<br>
    version of that conflict than the<br>
    official historic account.</p>
  <p> Riker hardly knows how to take this, but he looks at<br>
    the monitor.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What are you saying?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It would appear that the starship<br>
    which Captain Picard attacked,<br>
    had in fact, been under a flag<br>
    of truce...</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    And apparently, the captain<br>
    destroyed the ship without notice<br>

    Impossible. What about the fire<br>
    aboard the Stargazer?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    An accident in Engineering.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And the proof?</p>

    It is logged in his own voice.<br>
    Would you care to hear it?<br>

  <p>33 INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Picard seems stunned by what he's hearing from his desk<br>
    computer, his own voice plays back quietly under the<br>
    scene, not to be understood.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What does this mean?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't know, sir. That sounds<br>
    like your voice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Don't you know it is, Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, sir, I don't. I refuse to<br>
    believe you could have said that.</p>

  <p> PICARD'S RECORDED VOICE<br>

    ... and our direct hit destroyed<br>
    the unknown vessel instantly.</p>
  <p> Moving almost as through fatigue, Riker TURNS OFF the<br>
    desk computer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I recognize, of course, your voice<br>
    has been simulated somehow. I've<br>
    already put Data to work on it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you, Will.<br>
    (shakes head)<br>
    I never made that log entry, of<br>
    course. But it still creates a<br>
    duty for you to perform.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir, I must report it to<br>
    Starfleet. But at this distance,<br>
    it will take at least a full day<br>
    for subspace communications to<br>
    reach there...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... and another full day for their<br>
    answer to return. I'd like the<br>
    truth on this by then.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sir, you can't believe they'd<br>
    relieve you from command...</p>

    Why shouldn't they? Better safe<br>
    than sorry with the Ferengi now<br>
    making friendship overtures.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And it's certain that the Ferengi<br>
    are behind this faked log. No<br>
    wonder they're still out there,<br>
    waiting...</p>
  <p> Riker trails his words at the sight of Picard now<br>
    grimacing in pain.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Headache back, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Damn!<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I'll call the doctor again.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's no wonder you have one, with<br>
    all this going on, sir.<br>
    (moving for door)<br>
    Try to relax. I've got things in<br>
    hand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Once again...</p>
  <p> Riker EXITS. Picard, obviously still in pain, turns<br>
    back to his desk computer, switches it ON. From it,<br>
    he hears:</p>
  <p> PICARD'S RECORDED VOICE<br>
    This is a confession, given by<br>
    me, Jean-Luc Picard, commanding<br>
    USS Stargazer, in the hopes that<br>
    my belated honesty will be taken<br>
    into account by Starfleet when<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll take it in the Ready Room.<br>
    (as he EXITS)<br>
    A secure channel, Geordi.</p>
  <p> And as Riker closes the Ready Room door behind him,<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Starship Ferengi! This is<br>
    Commander Riker here. I'd like<br>
    to speak to First Officer Kazago.</p>
  <p> A beat, and on the small Viewer in the room, Kazago<br>
    APPEARS.</p>
  <p> KAZAGO<br>
    A problem, Riker?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is our channel secure on your end?</p>
  <p> KAZAGO<br>
    (pushes o.s. button)<br>
    It is now.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you aware of the details of<br>
    the Battle of Maxia?</p>
  <p> KAZAGO<br>
    Captain Bok has just made me aware<br>
    of it, Riker. The infamy of your<br>
    Picard is now fully known.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Infamy?!</p>
  <p> KAZAGO<br>
    I would call the wanton<br>
    destruction of an unarmed vessel<br>
    infamy.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Battle&quot; - 9/14/87 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker's doubt got a new shot in the arm.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And if I produce evidence that<br>
    Captain Picard's log entry was<br>
    falsified to indicate that... ?</p>
  <p> KAZAGO<br>
    What else would your decadent<br>
    culture say to defend such<br>
    disgrace?! But I can hardly<br>
    imagine you contacted me to<br>
    discuss an ancient battle.<br>
    (impatient)<br>
    What do you want of me?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Just one question.</p>
  <p> KAZAGO<br>
    As you humans say, I'm all ears.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    First officer to first officer,<br>
    Kazago, if your Captain Bok knew<br>
    of that, why this peaceful meeting<br>
    to present us with the Stargazer?</p>
  <p> KAZAGO<br>
    We freely give YOU back your<br>
    derelict warship and now you<br>
    accuse US of crime, Riker?!<br>
    (amazed)<br>
    I can bear NO more insults!</p>

    pain.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not resting, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    More like dying, Doctor. What's<br>
    wrong with me?!</p>
  <p> She puts the pain relief device on Picard again, turns<br>
    it on.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I wish to hell I knew, Captain.<br>
    But something unusual has<br>
    definitely happened to you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why do doctors always state the<br>
    obvious like it's a revelation?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Why do captains always think<br>
    they're immortal?<br>

    Aghhh! My head!</p>

    extension.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    worse, Doctor...</p>

  <p> Bok makes another adjustment, and the lines move slower.</p>
  <p>43 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS - BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> Beverly seems to be getting results, as Picard responds.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It has to be some kind of<br>
    emotional pressure connected with<br>
    the Stargazer...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    the subject as painful as the headache.</p>

  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (eyes CLOSE)<br>
    The Stargazer was an exploration<br>
    vessel. The fight at Maxia was<br>
    not my first action, but it was<br>
    the first time I ever killed<br>
    anyone.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You had no choice...</p>
  <p> Picard jams OPEN his eyes, the nightmare still alive<br>
    for him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Didn't I? I don't know<br>
    anymore... I just don't know.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Commander Riker told me about the<br>
    altered log, sir. If that's<br>
    troubling you...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (ignores her)<br>
    The last three nights, I... hear<br>

    order...<br>

    And now the Stargazer is really<br>
    here!<br>

    And that log... Am I going crazy?<br>
    How do I know if I was in my right<br>
    mind at Maxia? How do I know if<br>
    I'm in my right mind now?</p>
  <p> With that, Beverly quickly injects Picard with a<br>
    hypospray, and eases him back onto the bed. He doesn't<br>
    resist, as she attaches two sensor pads on his forehead.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. Whoever tampered with<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sir, are you abandoning...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    No. Her inertia will carry the<br>

    with us. Or did you sleep through<br>
    the Academy lecture on conserving<br>
    tractor beam power?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, sir. I'll release her, or<br>

    Anything?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

  <p> Picard's movement has brought him CLOSE SHOT and now,<br>
    as his eyes and expression determinedly decide what<br>
    next to do, CAMERA PUSHES IN TO EXTREME CLOSEUP.</p>
  <p>65 PICARD AND BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The bridge now filled with the shadows from Picard's<br>
    mind. Phantom bridge crew, fire, and smoke (DOUBLE<br>
    EXPOSURE) in the midst of the Battle of Maxia. Picard<br>
    alone is real, but reacting to the phantom figures and<br>
    battle.</p>
  <p> FIRST VOICE (V.O.)<br>
    Shields weakening, Captain!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Weapons report!</p>
  <p> SECOND VOICE (V.O.)<br>
    Phasers coming to full charge,<br>
    sir. Torpedoes armed!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Who are they? Identify them!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Battle&quot; - 9/14/87 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>65 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> FIRST VOICE (V.O.)<br>
    They're turning for a third pass<br>
    at us, sir!</p>
  <p> THIRD VOICE (V.O.)<br>
    We can't take another hit,<br>
    Captain!</p>
  <p>66 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Our regulars watching IMAGE of Stargazer on Main Viewer<br>
    as it turns toward them.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I can now feel anger from our<br>
    captain, first officer.<br>
    Frustration over whatever he<br>
    is re-living...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The Battle of Maxia, sir! That's<br>
    all it can be.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Data?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What is that &quot;maneuver&quot; he became<br>
    famous for... ?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (overlapping)<br>
    The Picard Maneuver!<br>
    (whirling)<br>
    Mister Data, what is the defense<br>
    against that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is no defense, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then devise one! Fast!</p>
  <p> Data reacts to this impossible demand, then is suddenly<br>
    busy. Main Viewer IMAGE SHIMMERS, DISSOLVES INTO IMAGE<br>
    OF KAZAGO ON THE FERENGI BRIDGE.</p>
  <p> KAZAGO<br>
    First Officer Kazago to hu-man<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not now, Kazago!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Battle&quot; - 9/14/87 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>66 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KAZAGO<br>
    We do not wish to become involved<br>
    in what has become clearly a<br>
    Federation matter...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Fine, fine, Enterprise out!</p>
  <p> KAZAGO<br>
    But you should also know that<br>
    DaiMon Bok no longer commands this<br>
    vessel, Riker. His first officer<br>
    has confined him for engaging in<br>
    this unprofitable adventure.<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Good luck, First Officer Riker.</p>
  <p> The Main Viewer again DISSOLVES INTO IMAGE OF THE<br>
    STARGAZER which is now heading directly for the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have computed a possibility,<br>
    Commander. Since even deep space<br>
    contains trace gases, sir, a<br>
    vessel in the Picard maneuver<br>
    might seem to disappear, but our<br>
    sensors could locate any sudden<br>
    compression of those gases...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (hurried)<br>
    And use it as an aiming point?<br>
    Blast our own captain to bits?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aim our tractor beam at it, sir!<br>
    Seize it! This class starship has<br>
    enough power for that.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (fast)<br>
    In our captain's words... make<br>
    it so! Set sensors, tractor<br>
    beam...<br>
    (waiting)<br>
    I hope you're right, Data...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No question of it, sir...</p>
  <p> Riker throws him an annoyed look.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Battle&quot; - 9/14/87 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>67 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND STARGAZER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as suddenly the Stargazer goes into a WARP BLUR.</p>
  <p>68 INT. ENTERPRISE MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Here she comes!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Stand by!</p>
  <p> On the Main Viewer, the Stargazer is suddenly two places<br>
    at once, as it unexpectedly appears right off the bow,<br>
    to the upper left side...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lock on tractor beam!</p>
  <p> And the Enterprise shoots out its mighty force-beam<br>
    tether again, entrapping the smaller Stargazer. The<br>
    Stargazer struggles to pull free -- it FIRES a salvo<br>
    that rocks against the Enterprise shields, hard.</p>
  <p>69 INT. STARGAZER BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Viewer shows the Enterprise, but Picard doesn't yet<br>
    &quot;see&quot; it... and he's quite alone on his bridge, his<br>
    delusion slipping. The smoke, flames and voices are<br>
    gone.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ready phasers!</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    Captain Picard, listen to me!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is that you, Vigo?</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    It's Commander Riker, sir!</p>
  <p> The Viewer switches to a FULL SHOT of Riker. Picard<br>
    is momentarily distracted by the new image.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Captain, hear me! Look around<br>
    you, the Ferengi are using a<br>
    thought device on you...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Battle&quot; - 9/14/87 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>69 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stand by for warp...<br>
    (inner conflict)<br>
    Who are you?!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's Riker, sir. Your Number One.<br>
    Look for a silver sphere...</p>
  <p> Picard struggles against his inner directive, as he<br>
    angles and sees the SPHERE behind him, glowing and<br>
    HUMMING.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing; sees it<br>
    too)<br>
    There it is! Destroy it with<br>
    your phaser, Captain!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Phaser...<br>
    (glances back)<br>
    Yes, a sphere... Bok used it...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Destory it!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (fumbles in pocket)<br>
    Phaser... destroy the sphere.</p>
  <p> And Picard manages to remove his phaser, and in a quick<br>
    beat, BLASTS the Ferengi brain machine to bits. Picard<br>
    staggers, weakened.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain! Are you all right?</p>
  <p> Picard feebly touches his insignia.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Enterprise, lock on. Beam me<br>
    home, Riker.</p>
  <p> As the familiar TRANSPORTER EFFECT DE-MATERIALIZES<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Battle&quot; - 9/14/87 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>70 EXT. ENTERPRISE AND STARGAZER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the smaller vessel, back on its tether, is towed off.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
