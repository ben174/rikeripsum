    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE AND THE FEARLESS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The two Federation starships come slowly together.<br>
    Here, next to the smaller vessel, the size of the new<br>
    Enterprise is breathtaking.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 41263.1.<br>
    We have rendezvoused with the<br>
    USS Fearless from which...</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - VARIOUS ANGLES (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> which INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER. PICARD is in his Command<br>
    Chair. COMMANDER RIKER is to his right. COUNSELOR<br>
    TROI to his left. SECURITY CHIEF LIEUTENANT YAR is at<br>
    the Tactical Station. Behind her at the Aft Station<br>
    is LIEUTENANT WORF. LIEUTENANT GEORDI LA FORGE has the<br>
    Conn, LIEUTENANT COMMANDER DATA is at the Ops Station.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... a Starfleet propulsion expert<br>
    and his assistant are beaming over<br>
    to conduct tests on the<br>
    Enterprise's warp drive engines.</p>
  <p> Picard consults the viewer at his position, then turns<br>
    to Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't understand your<br>
    concern, Number One. They're<br>
    not authorized to make any<br>
    alterations in our engines.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- REV. 8/4/87 -- TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    (glancing at command<br>
    viewer)<br>
    According to Starfleet's message,<br>
    they will simply test different<br>
    ways of entering warp speed and<br>
    different intermix formulas.<br>
    What's the harm in that?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's the specs that Kosinski sent<br>
    us. In my opinion, sir, they're<br>
    gibberish.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Gibberish?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Data, will you explain?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (turns to Picard)<br>
    Sir, we put Mister Kosinski's<br>
    specs into the computer and ran<br>
    a controlled test on them. There<br>
    was no improvement in engine<br>
    performance.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Then explain Starfleet's report<br>
    how the same tests on the USS<br>
    Ajax...<br>
    (indicates main viewer)<br>
    ... and then on the Fearless over<br>
    there, resulted in a measurable<br>
    increase in propulsion.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Our engines are new, sir, top<br>
    condition. The tests on those<br>
    older ships may have simply<br>
    straightened out some engine<br>
    inefficiency.</p>
  <p> A CALL from the Transporter Room.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- 7/30/87 -- TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED (2)</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Bridge from Transporter Chief.<br>
    Two from USS Fearless are ready<br>
    to beam over.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Com)<br>
    Stand by for Commander Riker,<br>
    Chief. He's on his way.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Obviously, something does<br>
    worry you about these tests.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir. And if you don't<br>
    mind...<br>
    (stands; indicates)<br>
    ... I'll ask Counselor Troi to<br>
    look these visitors over.</p>
  <p> Picard nods and Riker CROSSES with Troi toward the<br>
    turbolift.</p>
  <p>3 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As TRANSPORTER EFFECT MATERIALIZES the Visitors.<br>
    KOSINSKI has the look of someone operating at top<br>
    performance. His ASSISTANT, a humanoid alien, is small,<br>
    physically non-threatening, with a way of allowing<br>
    himself to blend into the background in a shy,<br>
    good-natured way. Kosinski dominates the room. He's<br>
    obsessed with himself and what he does. His manner is<br>
    arrogant, his demeanor authoritarian; he pulls every<br>
    eye toward him.</p>
  <p> Riker is with LT. COMMANDER ARGYLE, chief engineer,<br>
    a rough-edged, hearty man for whom the Enterprise<br>
    engines are the alpha and omega of his existence.<br>
    Counselor Troi holds back, observing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Welcome aboard, Mister Kosinski.<br>
    I'm the first officer, Commander<br>
    William Riker. This is...</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    Where is the captain, please?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (trying to be pleasant)<br>
    He is engaged in other duties,<br>
    sir...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- 7/30/87 -- TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    A ship's engines should be a<br>
    concern of the ship's captain...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They are, sir. Which is why they<br>
    make their first officers directly<br>
    responsible for engine condition<br>
    and performance.<br>
    (indicating Argyle)<br>
    Guided, of course, by one of our<br>
    chief engineers, Lieutenant Commander<br>
    Argyle in this case.</p>
  <p> ARGYLE<br>
    (to Kosinski)<br>
    A pleasure, sir. I appreciated<br>
    receiving the advance specs...</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    On which you have no end of<br>
    questions?</p>
  <p> ARGYLE<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Aye, I have.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to assistant)<br>
    And you, sir, are listed<br>
    as...as...</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT<br>
    (gentle voiced)<br>
    As Mister Kosinski's assistant.<br>
    My actual name is unpronounceable<br>
    by humans...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    From Tau Alpha C. That's very<br>
    distant...</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    ... All approved and described in<br>
    the Starfleet communications.<br>
    Now...<br>
    (heads for door)<br>
    ... I'd like to set up in the<br>
    Engine Room immediately...</p>
  <p> Kosinski begins to EXIT, FOLLOWED by his assistant.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- 7/30/87 -- TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Our chief engineer will show you<br>
    to his Engine Room.</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    No need -- I know my way around<br>
    starships...</p>
  <p> But Lt. Commander Argyle already joins him and, despite<br>
    Kosinski's obvious annoyance, leads the way.</p>
  <p>4 ANGLE ON RIKER AND TROI</p>
  <p> as they watch Kosinski leave.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    One thing Kosinski isn't hiding.<br>
    (at Troi's look)<br>
    A bad disposition.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Agreed... Also, he's arrogant,<br>
    overbearing, self-important.<br>
    (non-critical tone)<br>
    And very sure of himself and<br>
    his ability.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (considers this; then)<br>
    And the other one -- his assistant?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He's the puzzle.<br>
    (takes a minute to<br>
    phrase it)<br>
    With most life forms I feel<br>
    something. I may not be able to<br>
    interpret or understand it, but<br>
    I feel something, if only a<br>
    presence. With him -- nothing.<br>
    Empty space. It was as though<br>
    he isn't even here.<br>
    (seeks words for it)<br>
    ... Something about this concerns<br>
    me. I don't know what, I can't<br>
    point out a reason... yet.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- 7/30/87 -- TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Stay concerned. Please! The<br>
    safety of the Enterprise may be<br>
    entrusted to those two!</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- 7/30/87 -- ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>5 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> A dramatic HIGH ANGLE as Kosinski, his assistant, Riker,<br>
    and Argyle ENTER the area. There are some members of<br>
    the duty watch there -- as well as Wesley, who's working<br>
    on a school-related science project.</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    Inform the bridge I shall begin<br>
    the first test in precisely fifty<br>
    minutes. Why is that child here?</p>
  <p> ARGYLE<br>
    (throws off the answer)<br>
    He's working on a school project.<br>
    (that's not what's on<br>
    his mind)<br>
    Before you continue, there are<br>
    some questions. First, tell us...</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS SHOT, but stands slightly off to one side,<br>
    properly allowing Argyle to handle this, but ready to<br>
    support him where necessary.</p>
  <p>6 EMPHASIZING KOSINSKI</p>
  <p> He turns and faces them. (While this discussion plays<br>
    out, Kosinski's assistant -- who remains uninvolved --<br>
    has become attracted to Wesley's project and steps over<br>
    beside the young man. This is a small thing which<br>
    should go almost unnoticed.)</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    ... To save myself time, let me<br>
    ask those questions for you.</p>
  <p> Kosinski's arrogance builds with every word. He moves<br>
    around as he talks, like a prize fighter, circling,<br>
    jabbing, -- softening the opponent.</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You received the information which<br>
    Starfleet provided -- you fed it<br>
    into your computer -- being as<br>
    precise as humanly possible -- then<br>
    you ran a controlled test. And,<br>
    then, to your astonishment --<br>
    nothing happened.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- 7/30/87 -- ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>7 EMPHASIZING RIKER AND ARGYLE</p>
  <p> They are irritated by Kosinski's arrogance, yet it's<br>
    strangely reassuring. This self-assurance, coupled with<br>
    his record of success, makes them begin to think what<br>
    he proposes is possible.</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    So you said - &quot;What's going on?<br>
    This doesn't work. Kosinski's<br>
    a fraud.&quot;</p>
  <p>8 ANGLE ON KOSINSKI</p>
  <p> He steps closer for emphasis.</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    (smiles smugly)<br>
    You see, I have had this<br>
    discussion on other Starfleet<br>
    vessels. They didn't understand<br>
    it; why should you?</p>
  <p> Cutting through the rhetoric.</p>
  <p> ARGYLE<br>
    You are surely not saying it's<br>
    unexplainable?</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    I'm saying I'm not a teacher, and<br>
    don't want to become one. I have<br>
    neither the inclination nor time.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You have all the time you need.</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    I don't think you understand.<br>
    This has already been approved<br>
    by Starfleet Command.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But it hasn't been approved by<br>
    the chief engineer... or by me.</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    (a little snidely)<br>
    I didn't know that was necessary.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Now you do.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- 7/30/87 -- ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    Perhaps I should talk with Captain<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If you like, but it won't change<br>
    anything.</p>
  <p> Kosinski sees the resolve in Riker's eyes and knows he<br>
    can't bully his way through this.</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    How basic shall I be?</p>
  <p> Riker, without softening his expression in the<br>
    slightest, indicates with a wave that it's Kosinski's<br>
    call.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I leave that to you.</p>
  <p> Kosinski steps over to the computer. Everyone moves<br>
    a little closer, including Wesley. Kosinski's assistant<br>
    comes up next to the young man.</p>
  <p>9 EMPHASIZING KOSINSKI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> He gestures his assistant over to sit at an adjacent,<br>
    secondary computer keyboard. Then the assistant works<br>
    rapidly at this keyboard.</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    We can save a little time this<br>
    way. My assistant is laying in<br>
    my base formulas a bit more<br>
    rapidly than a human can do it...<br>
    (small chuckle)<br>
    ... even myself.</p>
  <p> Wesley is closely watching which keys the assistant is<br>
    using and what is appearing on the computer screen.</p>
  <p>10 COMPUTER SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> It is a three-dimensional geometric display which builds<br>
    and grows as WE WATCH, becoming a wonderfully complex<br>
    and incredibly beautiful pattern. It is nothing we<br>
    recognize nor understand. It is a theoretical<br>
    representation of warp power.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- 7/30/87 -- ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    Here is, in the simplest possible<br>
    terms, what I do. This warp drive<br>
    system was tuned only in the<br>
    grossest sense, at least to my<br>
    standard anyway. What I do is<br>
    specific.</p>
  <p> Kosinski waves his assistant back, addresses his primary<br>
    keyboard now and taps on a few keys. There is a slight<br>
    change.</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    How should I say this?<br>
    (finds the words)<br>
    Aah... sufficient to say for now,<br>
    these symbols and their<br>
    relationships have greater meaning<br>
    to me than to you...</p>
  <p> He taps on the keys again, and again there is a slight<br>
    change.</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... although you can in time learn<br>
    them. Then, those of you<br>
    sufficiently gifted, can duplicate<br>
    my results.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But the three percent efficiency<br>
    increase of the other vessels<br>
    could still have been caused by<br>
    other things such as simply<br>
    working more carefully, better<br>
    station coordination...</p>
  <p> ARGYLE<br>
    And you mention &quot;gifted.&quot; In<br>
    what way? Whatever any of us can<br>
    learn to do on a computer, another<br>
    computer can eventually perform<br>
    faster, more precisely...</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    Wrong! What the computer can't<br>
    do is create. Only the mind...<br>
    (taps his forehead)<br>
    ... is capable of true, original<br>
    thought.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- 7/30/87 -- ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Kosinski steps away from the computer. Riker and Argyle<br>
    follow him a few steps, then stop.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But what we're dealing with is<br>
    mechanics. However complex it<br>
    may be, it has to do with an<br>
    engine.</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    And that is exactly where you go<br>
    wrong. Warp drive has become so<br>
    complex that it is...</p>
  <p>11 ANGLE EMPHASIZING RIKER AND ARGYLE</p>
  <p> exchanging a puzzled look as:</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    ... as filled with mysteries as<br>
    nature itself.<br>
    (indicates)<br>
    If you'll view the screen with<br>
    me and consider the following.</p>
  <p>12 EMPHASIZING WESLEY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Drawn by curiosity, he moves closer to the computer<br>
    screen. The assistant, curious over the expressions<br>
    playing over Wesley's face, moves in beside him. In<br>
    b.g. Kosinski is touching a button or so on the keyboard<br>
    which produces minor changes on the screen as he<br>
    continues.</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    Is this merely &quot;mechanics&quot; or is<br>
    it nature that we deal with in<br>
    this? What else than nature are<br>
    elementals like space and time?</p>
  <p> Wesley looks puzzled as though some information on the<br>
    screen is out of place.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- 7/30/87 -- ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT KOSINSKI<br>
    (a statement, not (b.g.)<br>
    a question) You are trained through<br>
    Something troubles you the system -- you go in<br>
    about the way this is a straight line, competent,<br>
    configured. yes, and perhaps<br>
    even innovative in a<br>
    Wesley nods his head yes. minimalist way, but<br>
    Without Riker or Argyle what I am doing here is<br>

    Yes. But shouldn't (to Argyle)<br>

  <p> Wesley's attitude is KOSINSKI<br>
    important here. What he is (explodes)<br>
    doing is pure problem-solving. What do you mean, &quot;let<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're still trying to determine<br>

  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    I've always suspected this rate<br>
    of speed was possible, of course,<br>
    but, at this level -- never. We<br>

  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    Why not? Since I'm the one who<br>
    has made the so-called &quot;warp<br>

  <p> Wesley allows the assistant to lean on him as he gets to<br>
    his feet. The assistant pats the boy's shoulder as he<br>
    walks to his position. Again, he's tired -- worn -- but<br>
    not desperately so. It's going to get worse.</p>
  <p>47 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard is in his position. Troi is on his left. Tasha<br>
    is at the Tactical Station, Worf is monitoring the Aft<br>
    Stations, Geordi has the Conn and Data is at Ops.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> Kosinski's arrogance bristles.</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    You may tell the captain I am<br>
    ready, First Officer.</p>
  <p> Slightly to the side, the assistant gathers himself for<br>
    the effort. Wesley is near him. There's nothing Wesley<br>
    can do but hold a good thought. Which is what everyone<br>
    is doing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ready for you to engage, Captain.</p>

  <p> Everyone here is holding one thought -- SPEED! GO!</p>
  <p>51 ANGLE ON KOSINSKI</p>
  <p> He works the computer panel -- but nothing is happening.<br>
    The color drains from his face.</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    (panic rising)<br>
    It's not working...</p>
  <p>52 EMPHASIZING RIKER</p>
  <p> stepping closer -- and for the first time -- he, too, sees<br>
    the difference between what Kosinski is doing and what<br>
    his assistant is now doing.</p>
  <p>53 RIKER'S POV - THE ASSISTANT</p>
  <p> With great effort, the assistant forces himself to<br>
    concentrate.</p>
  <p>54 BACK TO EMPHASIZING RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> It's clear to him now. It's not Kosinski who's special --<br>
    it's the assistant. CAMERA CENTERS ON assistant who<br>
    focuses his total attention on the computer. Again he<br>
    phases -- pieces of him seem to disappear -- as though<br>
    leaving this dimension for another. Then, what he's<br>
    doing HAPPENS.</p>
  <p>55 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> It disappears. But this time it is a kind of speed<br>
    unlike anything ever seen.</p>
  <p>56 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Everyone reacting as the entire bridge and everyone on<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> Picard CROSSES to the turbolift. He speaks toward the<br>

    Main Engineering.</p>
  <p> The doors CLOSE.</p>
  <p>65 ANGLE ON WORF</p>
  <p> Something causes him to turn from his station and glance<br>
    to the side. What he sees makes him smile -- it's the<br>
    first time we've ever seen Worf smile. He stands and<br>
    moves toward it.</p>
  <p>66 ANGLE TO INCLUDE A KLINGON ANIMAL</p>
  <p> (Type of animal yet to be determined -- but it is LARGE.)<br>
    Worf and it are happy -- in a uniquely Klingon way -- to<br>
    see each other. But the rest of the bridge crew are<br>
    now on their feet, alarmed.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, I suppose that's what you...</p>
  <p> The animal BLINKS OUT OF EXISTENCE.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- 7/30/87 -- ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>69 ANGLE ON TASHA</p>
  <p> with a KITTEN having APPEARED on her console in front of<br>
    her. It MEOWS.</p>
  <p>70 INT. TURBOLIFT - PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as turbolift comes to a quick stop. Picard is already<br>
    moving forward as the doors OPEN onto NOTHINGNESS. A<br>
    sheer drop to the infinite. A vicious wind rips at<br>
    Picard where no wind is possible.</p>
  <p>71 ANOTHER ANGLE - PICARD</p>
  <p> He jams himself against the back of the turbolift. His<br>
    mind reeling. The doors automatically CLOSE. Then,<br>
    almost before Picard can react, the doors OPEN again.<br>
    He braces, steps gingerly OUT.</p>
  <p>72 EXT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard STEPPING OUT into the corridor to find everything<br>
    normal.</p>

  <p> HOLDING in the same position what is now a VERY BEGRIMED<br>
    KITTEN while Tasha herself is dressed very differently<br>
    in TATTERED CAST-OFF CLOTHING, HER FACE BEGRIMED TOO,<br>
    HER HAIR ASKEW. She puts the kitten down.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Now, run. This isn't a safe place<br>
    at all.</p>
  <p> She comes erect, alert, as from a distance comes the<br>
    SOUND OF SEVERAL ECHOING FOOTSTEPS. Then a hand-held<br>
    LIGHT PROBES NEARBY, PASSES. Tasha begins stealthily<br>
    retreating.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- 7/30/87 -- ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>75 ANOTHER ANGLE ON TASHA</p>
  <p> beginning to hurry, then quickly stopping again,<br>
    listening. MEN'S WHISPERS, MOVING CLOSER. Suddenly, a<br>
    hand reaches out and touches her shoulder.</p>
  <p>76 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - MATCHING REVERSE ANGLE ON TASHA</p>

    This is crazy! I was at the<br>

  <p>77 INT. CORRIDOR - TRUCKING WITH PICARD</p>
  <p> as he walks what appears to be an ordinary ship corridor<br>
    -- except for a crew pair who try to hurry past, looking<br>
    back over their shoulders, very concerned.</p>
  <p> FIRST CREWMEMBER<br>
    Captain, we need help...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (halting the pair)<br>
    How? What is troubling you?</p>
  <p> FIRST CREWMEMBER<br>
    Don't you see what's following<br>
    us?!</p>
  <p> They break away, HURRYING OFF. Picard whirls, looks in<br>
    the direction they were pointing.</p>
  <p>78 ANOTHER ANGLE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> with the corridor empty in the direction the crewmembers<br>
    indicated. Picard begins striding toward a corridor<br>
    turn in another direction.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- REV. 7/31/87 -- ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>79 ANGLE AT CORRIDOR TURN</p>
  <p> as Picard pulls up at the sight of an ELDERLY WOMAN,<br>
    (MOTHER PICARD) SEATED AT A SMALL TABLE IN HIS PATH.<br>
    She's brewing tea, smiles up at Picard.</p>
  <p> MOTHER PICARD<br>
    You look tense, Jean-Luc. Sit<br>
    and have a cup of tea.</p>
  <p> Picard is overwhelmed with emotion.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Maman.</p>
  <p> Immediately he feels it is not an image of his mother --<br>
    not a figment of his imagination.</p>
  <p> MOTHER PICARD<br>
    I'll make it good and strong, the<br>
    way you like it.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a step closer, trying to make sense out of<br>
    this strange reunion in a starship at the end of the<br>
    universe.</p>
  <p> MOTHER PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We will have a nice long talk.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Maman... this can't be! You've<br>
    been...</p>
  <p> MOTHER PICARD<br>
    Dead? But I'm always with you,<br>
    you know that.</p>
  <p> Picard eyes her, then seems to be able to accept that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Strange, but... yes, I've felt<br>
    that. But why now...suddenly...</p>
  <p> MOTHER PICARD<br>
    Why out here, you mean? At what<br>
    you see as the end of the<br>
    universe? Or do you see this as<br>
    the beginning of it?</p>

    short.</p>

    he's heard.</p>

  <p>82 ANGLE ON RIKER AND PICARD</p>
  <p> except that Picard is bending down toward empty corridor<br>
    -- his mother missing from Riker's viewpoint.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, you were reported headed<br>
    for...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (whirls; snaps)<br>
    Just a moment, Number One!</p>
  <p> Picard turns immediately back, but now with a stunned<br>
    expression coming over his face as he too now sees only<br>
    corridor. He slowly straightens up, wonderingly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- REV. 8/4/87 -- ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>83 CLOSE SHOT - PICARD</p>
  <p> moisture coming into his eyes now. He's genuinely<br>
    shaken and Riker, stepping into CLOSE TWO SHOT, sees it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Can I help you, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (beat)<br>
    No... no, let's help all of us.</p>
  <p>84 WIDER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Picard turning to the black Corridor companel. He<br>

  <p> The appropriate KLAXON BLASTS and LIGHTS come on.<br>
    Picard then moves in the direction Riker appeared<br>
    from and Riker follows.</p>
  <p>85 MONTAGE OF VARIOUS VESSEL AREAS</p>
  <p> featuring crewmembers stopped or stopping in the midst<br>
    of what must have been interesting illusions -- or were<br>
    they alternate realities? A MALE CREWMEMBER is caught<br>
    playing in a string quartet. The players are dressed in<br>
    period attire. Suddenly, he becomes aware that he's back<br>
    in uniform and has no violin. A FEMALE CREWMEMBER in a<br>
    &quot;tou-tou,&quot; pirouettes like a ballerina until she becomes<br>
    aware her dance sandals are gone and she stumbles off<br>
    balance.</p>

    them, Kosinski is off to the side facing away.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What is it Captain? Why are we<br>
    at General Quarters?</p>
  <p> Picard STEPS to a Wall Panel.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I had to get everyone's attention.<br>

  <p>88 ANGLE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> He shuts off the klaxon.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to the ship's company)<br>
    This is the captain. This is not<br>
    a drill. It seems that in this<br>
    place, the physical universe and<br>
    ... and the world of ideas are<br>
    intermixed. What we think also<br>

  <p> He turns his face from the wall, is diminished --<br>
    embarrassed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It wasn't him. It never was.<br>
    It was his assistant.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What are you talking about?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Kosinski wasn't the one<br>
    controlling the warp experiment.</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    It was me!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    The equations he punched in were<br>
    nonsense, just as we thought.</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    (almost in tears;<br>
    to Riker)<br>
    I honestly thought it was me.<br>
    I thought somehow... somehow that<br>
    I was operating on his level.</p>
  <p> Picard turns his attention to the assistant who is lying<br>
    on the table where Beverly attends him with a medical<br>
    tricorder.</p>
  <p> ARGYLE<br>
    It's also my fault, Captain. I<br>
    should have realized it wasn't<br>
    Kosinski.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How could you? How could<br>
    anyone... ?</p>

    Wesley did.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (whirls to Wesley)<br>
    If you knew something, why didn't<br>
    you say so?!</p>

  <p>91 CONTINUED</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He tried -- twice. But I didn't<br>
    listen.</p>
  <p> Picard nods. He can understand how that could happen,<br>
    and steps closer to where Beverly tends the assistant.</p>

    He's unconscious. Why?</p>

  <p> The Traveler on a medical table, Beverly and MEDICAL<br>
    ASSISTANT working over him with a medical tricorder and<br>
    other medical equipment, but obviously getting puzzling<br>

    Cause?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    You may want him here before we're<br>

    longer we may lose the ability<br>
    to tell the difference between<br>
    thought and reality. Regardless<br>
    of the risk, we must wake him...<br>
    now.</p>

  <p> In b.g., Wesley recoils slightly. He's too well<br>
    schooled to say anything to the Captain, but his concern<br>
    for the Traveler is evident.</p>
  <p>94 CLOSER ON MEDICAL TABLE</p>
  <p> Beverly makes her attempt with an atomized stimulant.</p>
  <p>95 ANGLE - PICARD, RIKER</p>
  <p> watching, trying to hide their concern.</p>
  <p>96 VARIOUS ANGLES</p>
  <p> as the Traveler comes slowly to consciousness. He looks<br>
    weak and worn. Picard moves in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you recognize me? I'm the<br>
    captain... I need answers.</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    Do my best... to provide...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Who are you? Or what?</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    I am -- a Traveler.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A traveler? What is your<br>
    destination?</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Destination?</p>
  <p> The Traveler seems to be growing a bit stronger.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, what place are you trying<br>
    to reach?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- 7/30/87 -- ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>96 CONTINUED</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    Place? No, there is no<br>
    specific place I wish to go.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then what is the purpose of this<br>
    journey?</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    Curiosity.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's not an answer. What is<br>
    it that you want?</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    I have certain... &quot;abilities.&quot;<br>
    They give me an understanding of<br>
    -- propulsion. I have been trading<br>
    this for passage on Starfleet<br>
    vessels.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Allowing Kosinski to take the<br>
    credit for what you did.</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    (trace of a smile)<br>
    It seemed the sensible way.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Until now.</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    Captain, I seek only<br>
    transportation in order to see<br>
    and experience your... your<br>
    reality. I am not a threat to<br>
    you, your ship or your crew.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    He isn't, Captain. I know he<br>
    isn't.</p>
  <p> Beverly silences Wesley with a look; he may be correct,<br>
    but he's out of line.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Our &quot;reality?&quot; And in satisfying<br>
    yourself, you have put my ship and<br>
    my crew at great risk.</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    I have made some mistakes.</p>
  <p><br>
    STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- REV. 8/7/87 -- ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>96 CONTINUED (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Some mistakes? What kind of<br>
    &quot;mistake&quot; can cause these<br>
    incredible explosions of velocity?</p>
  <p> The Traveler hesitates, just as a physicist of today<br>
    would be given pause if asked to explain nuclear fusion<br>
    to a caveman because...</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    ... I don't know if I can put it<br>
    in terms you'll understand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I believe that there may be a warp<br>
    speed that could have gotten us<br>
    to Galaxy M-Thirty-Three... but<br>
    there is no &quot;velocity&quot; of any<br>
    magnitude which could bring us<br>
    to wherever this is. Can you<br>
    tell us if our navigation sensors<br>
    are right? Is this millions of<br>
    light years from where we were?</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What got us here?</p>
  <p> The Traveler hesitates. Kosinski moves in closer. He<br>
    doesn't want to miss a word, there might be a way for<br>
    him to salvage something out of this after all.</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    Thought.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thought?!</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    You do understand don't you that<br>
    thought is the basis of all<br>
    reality? The... &quot;energy&quot; of<br>
    thought, to put it in your terms,<br>
    is very powerful.</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    That's not an explanation.</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    I have the ability to act like<br>
    a lens which focuses thought.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- 7/30/87 -- ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>96 CONTINUED (3)</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    That's just so much nonsense.<br>
    You're asking us to believe in<br>
    magic.</p>
  <p> As tired as he is, the Traveler can still find a chuckle.</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    Yes -- this could seem like magic<br>
    to you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, it actually makes some sense<br>
    to me. Only the power of thought<br>
    could explain what's been<br>
    happening. Especially out here.</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    Thought is the essence of where<br>
    you are now. You do understand<br>
    the danger?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Chaos. What we think is what<br>
    happens.</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    It pains me I was so careless,<br>
    Captain.<br>
    (sighs with regret)<br>
    My intent was only to observe,<br>
    not to cause this. You should<br>
    not be here until your far, far<br>
    distant future. Certainly not<br>
    until you have learned control.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You are from a different time,<br>
    aren't you?</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    Well -- no -- not exactly from<br>
    another &quot;time.&quot; Although as you<br>
    understand the concept... yes,<br>
    perhaps that term fits as well<br>
    as any.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And you have this ability to...<br>
    ah... &quot;travel.&quot;</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- REV. 7/31/87 -- ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>96 CONTINUED (4)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And others of your kind can also<br>
    &quot;travel?&quot;</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then, why -- in all of our history<br>
    -- has there never been a record<br>
    of you or someone like you having<br>
    visited us?</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    (laughs)<br>
    What wonderful arrogance. There<br>
    is no record because we have not<br>
    visited you before.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why not?</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    Ah. Well, up until now ... if<br>
    you'll forgive this... when<br>
    compared to many others in the<br>
    universe, you have been...<br>
    uninteresting. It's only now that<br>
    your life form begins to merit<br>
    serious attention. I'm...<br>
    sorry...</p>
  <p> The Traveler falls back into a kind of sleep.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, no -- none of that.</p>
  <p> Beverly begins hurriedly checking him over.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He's unconscious again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Revive him.</p>
  <p> Beverly hesitates, sees Picard's determination, gives<br>
    the Traveler another hypo injection. He begins to stir<br>
    back into consciousness. Beverly gives Picard a<br>
    concerned look.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Whatever you need from him, you<br>
    better get it soon.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    I suggest, sir, that the first<br>
    jump out of our galaxy was as he<br>
    said, a &quot;mistake&quot;...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Or he was distracted by something.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nods)<br>
    But it weakened him in some way,<br>
    leading to the incredible jump<br>
    out here.</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    Theory!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Kosinski)<br>
    Can you propose some facts that<br>
    fit this?</p>
  <p> Kosinski obviously can't. During this the Traveler is<br>
    back to consciousness, gathering some strength again.<br>
    Picard turns to him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (with a hard edge)<br>
    Can you get us back?</p>
  <p> KOSINSKI<br>
    Wait, Captain. Not so fast. We<br>
    have an opportunity for scientific<br>
    discovery here...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And report our observations how?<br>
    To whom?<br>
    (to Traveler)<br>
    Can you get us back?!</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    I will try.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One, you'll take the<br>
    Traveler to Main Engineering;<br>
    I'll be on the bridge...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    He is very weak.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know.</p>

  <p>96 CONTINUED (6)</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    The Captain is right. We don't<br>
    have much time.<br>
    (to all)<br>
    But first, I request a moment with<br>
    the captain. Alone!</p>
  <p> Picard reflects, then nods to all the others. They<br>
    LEAVE him alone with the Traveler. Wesley looks from<br>
    the captain to his new friend, turns and WALKS OUT too.</p>
  <p>97 TWO SHOT - PICARD AND TRAVELER</p>
  <p> Picard has watched Wesley leave, then:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Strange how he seems to care for<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> The Traveler nods -- touched.</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    He will forget me in time. Which<br>
    is as it should be.<br>
    (eyes Picard; then)<br>
    It is Wesley I wanted to speak to<br>
    you about.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The boy?</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    (nods)<br>
    It's best you do not repeat this<br>
    to the others... especially not<br>
    to the mother. Whatever may<br>
    happen, it is best it proceeds<br>
    naturally.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (hurriedly)<br>
    I must get my ship back; do we<br>
    have time for this?</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    Yes. He and a few like him are<br>
    why I travel.<br>
    (sitting upright; intent<br>
    now)<br>
    You have it in your power to<br>
    encourage him without<br>
    interfering...</p>

  <p>97 CONTINUED</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Encourage him in what?</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    How shall I explain? Are you<br>
    acquainted with the intricacies<br>
    of what is called here... music?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Somewhat.</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    And musical genius such as I saw<br>
    in one of your ship's libraries.<br>
    One called Mozart, for example?<br>
    (at Picard's nod)<br>
    Who as a small child wrote<br>
    astonishing symphonies as you call<br>
    them... whose genius made music<br>
    a tangible reality to be not only<br>
    heard, but also seen and felt<br>
    beyond the ability, the<br>
    understanding, of others?</p>
  <p> Traveler begins coming to his feet, Picard supporting<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Your Wesley is such a person.<br>
    Not with music but with the<br>
    equally lovely intricacies of<br>
    time, energy, propulsion...<br>
    (gestures)<br>
    ... and the instruments of this<br>
    vessel which allow all that to<br>
    be played.</p>
  <p> The Traveler begins moving weakly toward the hatch<br>
    leading to the corridor.</p>
  <p> TRAVELER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You are right, I must hurry now...<br>
    (pausing at the door)<br>
    You are right in something else.<br>
    He is also just a boy for now.<br>
    He should be encouraged... but<br>
    told none of this.</p>

    over and Picard indicates the Traveler.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Help him to Engineering. I'll<br>
    be on the bridge. We must try<br>
    to get back home.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> He helps support the Traveler, MOVING OFF.</p>
  <p>99 PANNING PICARD -- FURTHER ALONG CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as he comes upon a CREWMEMBER who stands before a wall<br>
    of flame. He's frozen with fear. Picard grabs the man<br>
    by the shoulder.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Put it out.</p>
  <p> CREWMEMBER<br>
    How?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Think! Put the flame out in your<br>
    thoughts.</p>
  <p> The crewmember looks confused for a beat, then as he turns<br>
    back to the fire, it's doused.</p>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>

  <p>119 ANGLE ON WESLEY</p>
  <p> Shaken, somehow, he realizes the Traveler is gone this<br>
    time for good.</p>
  <p>120 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Coming out of a MIXED WARP SPEED EFFECT to travel normal<br>
    warp.</p>
  <p>121 INT. BRIDGE - ESTABLISHING</p>
  <p> Everyone looking very relieved. The red alert lights<br>
    go out.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Warp one-point-five, sir...<br>
    (turns)<br>
    ... which is what my instruments<br>
    have read all along.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Our position reads exactly what<br>
    it was before this sleigh-ride<br>
    began, sir.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sleigh-ride?</p>
  <p> Picard waves Data off.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Or whatever you want to call it,<br>
    Data. I don't have a name for<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> The turbolift door OPENS. Riker ENTERS the bridge,<br>
    moving to his position as:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Traveler's gone, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Gone?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- 7/30/87 -- ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>121 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nods)<br>
    He phased completely out of<br>
    existence... at least out of our<br>
    existence.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a moment to consider this. Then:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Attention all decks. This is to<br>
    inform you that the Traveler has<br>
    left us. With your support, he<br>
    has returned us to our galaxy.<br>
    Wherever he has gone, we wish him<br>
    well.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing; to Riker)<br>
    Have the boy come up on the<br>
    bridge, Number One.</p>
  <p> Riker starts to either object or comment on this. Then<br>
    he decides instead to obey the order.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (speaking toward his<br>
    companel)<br>
    Wesley Crusher, report to the<br>
    Bridge.<br>
    (looks to Picard, adds)<br>
    On the double.</p>
  <p> A flicker of a smile from Picard... almost.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Our next assignment is on this<br>
    heading?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, Mister La Forge...<br>
    Increase to warp five. Same<br>
    heading.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Warp five, sir.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Same heading, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- 7/30/87 -- ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>121 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> The turbolift doors snap OPEN. It is Wesley, looking a<br>
    bit warily toward Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come onto the bridge, Wesley.<br>
    (as Wesley hesitates)<br>
    Move!</p>
  <p> Wesley hurries onto the bridge and approaches Picard.<br>
    All the Bridge Crew watch with interest. No one knows<br>
    what is coming.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander Riker told me how<br>
    supportive you were in<br>
    Engineering. Well done.</p>
  <p> Wesley stiffens with pride.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    At ease -- sit here in Command.</p>
  <p> Picard indicates the bench beside Troi. Wesley<br>
    hesitates.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain -- that's not allowed.<br>
    Your orders.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh, that's true. I can't waive<br>
    them again.<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    Only commissioned officers.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's quite all right, sir, I<br>
    understand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Please don't interrupt me, Wesley.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (very nervous again)<br>
    Sorry, sir...</p>
  <p> Picard looks first from Riker then to Wesley and back<br>
    to Riker. He knows that Riker is orchestrating this<br>
    a little.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- 7/30/87 -- ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>121 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Any commission rank?<br>
    (he pauses)<br>
    Even an ensign?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then he would have authorized<br>
    access to the bridge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, then, I'll have to make him<br>
    an Acting Ensign.<br>
    (he touches a switch)<br>
    Captain's log Stardate 41263.4.<br>
    For outstanding performance in<br>
    the best of Starfleet tradition<br>
    -- Wesley Crusher is made acting<br>
    ensign. With all the duties and<br>
    privileges of that rank.<br>
    (he clicks off)<br>
    And Mister Crusher, whether the<br>
    rank becomes permanent is up to<br>
    you.<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    At the first opportunity your<br>
    entrance application will be<br>
    tendered to Starfleet Academy.<br>
    Until then you will learn this<br>
    ship. Every operation -- every<br>
    function. Commander Riker -- a<br>
    duty schedule for Mister Crusher.<br>
    Heavy on study.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Meanwhile, you can sit and learn<br>
    something here.</p>
  <p> Wesley steps over and takes his seat. His eyes shining<br>
    as he looks around the bridge -- belonging for the first<br>
    time in his life.</p>
  <p>122 FULL ON COMMAND AREA</p>
  <p> Riker glances over at Wesley, then to Picard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where None... &quot; -- 7/30/87 -- ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>122 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sir, shall I send for Doctor<br>
    Crusher?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why? Is someone ill?<br>
    (beat; quietly to<br>
    Wesley)<br>
    Or do you want to go tell her<br>
    about this?</p>
  <p>123 ANGLE EMPHASIZING WESLEY</p>
  <p> Tempted, but:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    If you don't mind, sir, I'd like<br>
    to sit here awhile. I'll tell<br>
    her later.</p>
  <p>124 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Warps away.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
