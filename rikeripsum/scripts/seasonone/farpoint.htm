  TEASER</p>
<p align="center"> FADE IN:</p>
<p align="center">1 EXT. SPACE - STARSHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> The U.S.S. Enterprise NCC 1701-D traveling at warp speed<br>
  through space.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD V.O.<br>
  Captain's log, stardate 42353.7.<br>
  Our destination is planet Cygnus<br>
  IV, beyond which lies the great<br>
  unexplored mass of the galaxy.</p>
<p align="center">2 OTHER INTRODUCTORY ANGLES (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> on the gigantic new Enterprise NCC 1701-D.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD V.O.<br>
  My orders are to examine Farpoint,<br>
  a starbase built there by the<br>
  inhabitants of that world.<br>
  Meanwhile ...</p>
<p align="center">3 INT. ENGINE ROOM</p>
<p align="center"> Huge, with a giant wall diagram showing the immensity<br>
  of this Galaxy Class starship.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD V.O.<br>
  (continuing)<br>
  ... I am becoming better<br>
  acquainted with my new command,<br>
  this Galaxy Class U.S.S.<br>
  Enterprise.</p>
<p align="center">4 CLOSER ON VESSEL DIAGRAM</p>
<p align="center"> Showing the details and size of this enormous starship.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD V.O.<br>
  I am still somewhat in awe of its<br>
  size and complexity.</p>
<p align="center">5 INT. LOUNGE DECK</p>
<p align="center"> With its huge windows revealing the immense span of the<br>
  Starship's outer surface.<br>
</p>
<p align="center">5 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD V.O.<br>
  (continuing)<br>
  ... my crew we are short in<br>
  several key positions, most<br>
  notably ...</p>
<p align="center">6 INT. BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD, TROI, and DATA seated in the command area.<br>
  Starfleet LIEUTENANT WORF, a young Klingon, is at the<br>
  &quot;Ops&quot; station and a SUPERNUMERARY is at &quot;Conn&quot;.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD V.O.<br>
  (continuing)<br>
  ... a first officer, but I am<br>
  informed that a highly experienced<br>
  man, one Commander William Riker,<br>
  will be waiting to join our ship<br>
  when we reach our Cygnus IV<br>
  destination.</p>
<p align="center">7 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD AND DATA</p>
<p align="center"> As Picard turns to Data:</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  You will agree, Data, that<br>
  Starfleet's instructions are<br>
  difficult?</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  Difficult ... how so? Simply<br>
  solve the mystery of Farpoint<br>
  Station.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (smiles)<br>
  As simple as that.</p>
<p align="center"> TROI<br>
  Farpoint Station. Even the name<br>
  sounds mysterious.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  The problem, Data, is that another<br>
  life form built that base. How<br>
  do I negotiate a friendly<br>
  agreement for Starfleet to use<br>
  it while at the same time snoop<br>
  around finding how and why they<br>
  built it?</p>
<p align="center"><br>
  7 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  Inquiry ... the word snoop ... ?</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Data, how can you be programmed<br>
  as a virtual encyclopedia of human<br>
  information without knowing a<br>
  simple word like snoop?</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  Possibility ... a kind of human<br>
  behavior I was not designed to<br>
  emulate?</p>
<p align="center"> It is all Troi can do to keep from smiling.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  It means 'to spy, to sneak' ...</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  (interrupting;<br>
  delighted)<br>
  Ah! To seek covertly, to go<br>
  stealthily, to slink, slither ...</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (wanting to cut it off)<br>
  Exactly, yes ...</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  ... to glide, creep, skulk,<br>
  pussyfoot, gumshoe ...</p>
<p align="center"> Data trails off his words, finally becoming aware of<br>
  the annoyance registering on Picard's face. Troi cannot<br>
  keep back the smile now ... then suddenly her face is<br>
  contorted in pain.</p>
<p align="center"> TROI<br>
  Captain ... I'm sensing a ... a<br>
  powerful mind ...</p>
<p align="center"> Interrupted by the sound of a BRIDGE ALARM.</p>
<p align="center">8 WIDER ANGLE</p>
<p align="center"> All checking their consoles, puzzled at readings they're<br>
  getting.</p>
<p align="center"> WORF<br>
  Something strange on the detector<br>
  circuits ...</p>
<p align="center">8 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> OVERLAPPED by an ever more compelling SECOND BRIDGE<br>
  ALARM (similar to the old naval HONKING SOUND) begins<br>
  to sound. At the same time, the main viewer FLICKERS<br>
  and an unusual SHINING, SPARKLING GRID SHAPE APPEARS<br>
  stretching across the whole of the galaxy ahead of them.</p>
<p align="center">9 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND GRID (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> Emphasizing the incredibly SHINING GRID which the<br>
  Enterprise is approaching. Seeming impossibly large,<br>
  yet in some ways as delicate as a spiderweb, it is<br>
  composed of interlocking geometrical shapes.</p>
<p align="center">10 INT. BRIDGE - VARIOUS ANGLES</p>
<p align="center"> Data is looking up from his command position console,<br>
  showing as much alarm as we'll ever see on his face.</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  It registers as solid, Captain...</p>
<p align="center"> TROI<br>
  Or an incredibly powerful<br>
  forcefield. But if we collide<br>
  with either ...</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (to Conn)<br>
  Go to Condition Yellow. And shut<br>
  off that damned noise.</p>
<p align="center"> Conn turns OFF honking sound. Picard is taking time to<br>
  check all readings but we're now coming very close to<br>
  the strange grid.</p>
<p align="center"> WORF<br>
  Shields and deflectors, up, sir.</p>
<p align="center"> Milking the drama of approaching collision. Then,<br>
  conversationally:</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Reverse power, full stop.</p>
<p align="center"> CONN<br>
  Controls to full stop, sir.</p>
<p align="center"> The strange shimmering GRID on the viewer is now very<br>
  close to us as Enterprise movement stops.</p>
<p align="center"> CONN<br>
  Now reading full stop, sir.</p>
<p align="center">10 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> Overlapped by something akin to a ROLLING THUNDER STORM<br>
  accompanied by a BRILLIANT AND SUSTAINED FLASH OF LIGHT<br>
  ON THE BRIDGE to the side of Picard. The light burst<br>
  physically shakes all bridge crew for an instant, then<br>
  RESOLVES ITSELF INTO A HUMAN SIZE FIGURE standing at<br>
  that point on the bridge. As the bridge crew's eyes<br>
  adjust, it does indeed appear to be a human ... but one<br>
  dressed and posturing as an Elizabethan era sea captain<br>
  complete with Sir Walter Raleigh type &quot;court dress&quot;,<br>
  complete with neck ruffles, lace, leg stockings,<br>
  ceremonial sword, etc. Now and later, we shall know<br>
  this life form as &quot;Q&quot;.</p>
<p align="center">11 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> as &quot;Q&quot; (Elizabethan) makes a formal bow (of that 
  same<br>
  era) to Picard. At which the turbolift doors snap open<br>
  and TWO SECURITY CREW members start to ENTER, led by<br>
  Security and Weapons Officer NATASHA YAR. However, &quot;Q&quot;<br>
  merely gives a nod in that direction and a miniature of<br>
  the space grid outside APPEARS AT THE TURBOLIFT<br>
  ENTRANCE, barring the security team's entrance and<br>
  CLOSES THE TURBOLIFT DOORS. Then &quot;Q&quot; turns toward<br>
  Picard.</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (ELIZABETHAN)<br>
  You are notified that your kind<br>
  has infiltrated the galaxy too<br>
  far already. You are directed<br>
  to return to your own solar system<br>
  immediately.</p>
<p align="center">12 ANGLE TO INCLUDE OPS AND CONN</p>
<p align="center"> We will see Conn stealthily, carefully reaching to the<br>
  small phaser on his belt.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  That's quite a directive. Would<br>
  you mind identifying what you are?</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (ELIZABETHAN)<br>
  We call ourselves &quot;the Q&quot;. Or<br>
  you may call me that; it's all<br>
  much the same thing.<br>
  (indicating costume)<br>
  And I have presented myself to<br>
  you as a fellow ship captain so<br>
  that you will better understand<br>
  me.<br>
  (indicates)<br>
  Go back from where you...</p>
<p align="center">13 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> Interrupted by Conn drawing his phaser. But &quot;Q&quot; barely<br>
  nods toward Conn at which a FLUTTERING ELECTRIC BLUE WAVE<br>
  envelopes that bridge crewman, and we HEAR THE BRIEF<br>
  BEGINNINGS OF A SCREAM as Conn falls with the SOUND of<br>
  a frozen hard object striking the deck. Picard comes<br>
  to his feet, ignoring &quot;Q&quot; as:</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (ELIZABETHAN)<br>
  Stay where you are!</p>
<p align="center">14 EMPHASIZING PICARD</p>
<p align="center"> Who is clearly very angry as he kneels at the prone form<br>
  of Conn who appears to have been instantly frozen solid.<br>
  Troi hurries INTO SHOT kneeling too. There is even<br>
  white evaporation vapor rising up from the body.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Data, call medics!</p>
<p align="center"> TROI<br>
  He's frozen. Can you feel the<br>
  cold?</p>
<p align="center"> Picard grabs up Conn's phaser from the deck (reversing<br>
  it, wisely), stands and puts it under &quot;Q's&quot; nose.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  He would not have injured you!<br>
  (indicates phaser)<br>
  Do you understand this; the stun<br>
  setting?</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (ELIZABETHAN)<br>
  Knowing humans as you do, Captain,<br>
  would you want to be captured<br>
  helpless by them?<br>
  (moves closer)<br>
  Now, go back or you will certainly<br>
  die!</p>
<p align="center"> FADE OUT:</p>
<p align="center"> PART ONE </p>
<p align="center"> FADE IN:</p>
<p align="center">15 EXT. U.S.S. ENTERPRISE AND GRID (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> Appropriate THEME MUSIC with spaceship hanging<br>
  motionless, still facing the mysterious SHIMMERING GRID<br>
  that stretches in front of it from galaxy horizon to<br>
  horizon.</p>
<p align="center">16 INTO. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING CONN'S FORM</p>
<p align="center"> In the b.g. on a floating stretcher Conn is being taken<br>
  to the turbolift, advanced medical emergency aids are<br>
  attached to his body.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Is he still alive?</p>
<p align="center"> MEDIC<br>
  For now. We'll do our best, sir.</p>
<p align="center">17 EMPHASIZING &quot;Q&quot; (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> Ignoring the previous, intent instead on inspecting his<br>
  Elizabethan costume as Picard comes up to him.</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (ELIZABETHAN)<br>
  Your little centuries go by so<br>
  rapidly, Captain. Perhaps you'll<br>
  understand this better.</p>
<p align="center"> The Visitor moves his hand slightly. We hear the same<br>
  ROLLING THUNDER SOUND. Another BLINDING LIGHT FLASH<br>
  and his body remains the same humanoid face and figure<br>
  as with the Elizabethan dress, but now the green<br>
  officer's uniform of the U.S. Marine Corps. Over his<br>
  jacket pocket three rows of medals and his narrow<br>
  garrison cap shows the bars of a Captain.</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (MARINE CAPTAIN)<br>
  Actually, the issue at stake is<br>
  patriotism. You must return to<br>
  your world and put an end to the<br>
  communists. All it takes is a<br>
  few good men.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  What? That nonsense is centuries<br>
  behind us!</p>
<p align="center">17 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (MARINE CAPTAIN)<br>
  But you can't deny Captain, that<br>
  you're still a dangerous, savage<br>
  child-race.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Most certainly I deny it. I agree<br>
  that we still were when ...<br>
  (indicating)<br>
  ... humans wore costumes like that<br>
  four hundred years ago...</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (MARINE CAPTAIN)<br>
  At which time you slaughtered<br>
  millions in silly arguments about<br>
  how to divide the resources of<br>
  your little world. And four<br>
  hundred years before that you were<br>
  murdering each other in quarrels<br>
  over tribal god-images. And since<br>
  there have been no indications<br>
  that humans will ever change<br>
  .....</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  But even as far back as... !<br>
  (indicates)<br>
  ... that costume, we had begun to<br>
  make rapid progress.</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (MARINE CAPTAIN)<br>
  Oh? Shall we review your &quot;rapid<br>
  progress&quot;?</p>
<p align="center">18 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> The &quot;Q&quot; visitor moves a hand again to create THE 
  SAME<br>
  SOUNDS and the SAME BLINDING FLASH, producing the same<br>
  human image but this time unshaven and with an UGLY<br>
  AUTOMATION LOOK AND IN THE UNIFORM OF A MILITARY OFFICER<br>
  FROM THE MID 21st CENTURY WARS. Q's voice sounds a bit<br>
  drugged now as he eyes his new costume.</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (21ST CENTURY)<br>
  (interrupting)<br>
  Rapid progress to where humans<br>
  learned to control their military<br>
  with drugs.</p>
<p align="center">19 ANGLE INCLUDING OPS POSITION</p>
<p align="center"> As Worf gets a message and turns toward Picard.</p>
<p align="center">19 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> WORF<br>
  Sir, sickbay reports that<br>
  Lieutenant Graham's condition is<br>
  better.</p>
<p align="center"> All have turned toward Worf, showing relief.</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (21ST CENTURY)<br>
  Concern for one's comrade. How<br>
  touching.</p>
<p align="center"> WORF<br>
  (indicates &quot;Q&quot;)<br>
  And now, sir, a personal request.<br>
  Permission to clean up the bridge?</p>
<p align="center"> Picard shakes head, stares Worf down when he seems about<br>
  to protest. Meanwhile Tasha has come to her feet too:</p>
<p align="center"> TASHA<br>
  Lieutenant Worf is right, sir.<br>
  As Security Chief I can't just<br>
  stand here and ....</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Yes, you can, Tasha.</p>
<p align="center"> During this, &quot;Q&quot; has withdrawn a slender tube attached<br>
  to his 21st Century uniform, makes an adjustment which<br>
  lets a round pill roll into his mouth and bites down<br>
  on it with a &quot;POP&quot; SOUND.</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (21ST CENTURY)<br>
  Ah, yes... better!<br>
  (deep breath, feeling<br>
  it)<br>
  Then later, on finally reaching<br>
  deep space, humans of course found<br>
  enemies to fight out there too.<br>
  And to broaden those struggles....<br>
  (indicating Worf and<br>
  Tasha)<br>
  .... you again found allies to<br>
  permit still more murdering and<br>
  all over again the same old story.</p>
<p align="center">19 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (interrupting; angry)<br>
  No! The most dangerous 'same old<br>
  story' is the one we're meeting<br>
  now! Those who go on<br>
  misinformation, half-information,<br>
  self-righteous life forms who are<br>
  eager not to learn but to<br>
  prosecute, to judge anything they<br>
  don't understand or can't<br>
  tolerate.</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (21ST CENTURY)<br>
  What an interesting idea.<br>
  Prosecute and judge?</p>
<p align="center"> CAMERA CENTERS ON &quot;Q&quot; as he absorbs what Picard has<br>
  said. He takes a step or two, turns.</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (21ST CENTURY)<br>
  (continuing)<br>
  And suppose it turns out we<br>
  understand you humans only too<br>
  well?</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  We've no fear of what the true<br>
  facts about us will reveal.</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (21ST CENTURY)<br>
  The facts about you? Splendid,<br>
  splendid! You are a veritable<br>
  fountain of good ideas.<br>
  (smiling; pleasant)<br>
  There are preparations to make,<br>
  Captain, but when I return...</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; gives a 21st Century salute to Picard.</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (21ST CENTURY)<br>
  (continuing)<br>
  ... we will proceed exactly as you<br>
  suggest!</p>
<p align="center"> A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT and the alien visitor is gone.</p>
<p align="center">20 WIDE ANGLE ON BRIDGE</p>
<p align="center"> It takes a moment to accept the fact &quot;Q&quot; is really 
  gone<br>
  then Worf turns to Picard.</p>
<p align="center">20 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> WORF<br>
  Sir... respectfully submit our only<br>
  choice is to fight. If we<br>
  Klingons understand anything, it<br>
  is the meaning of that kind of<br>
  talk.</p>
<p align="center"> TASHA<br>
  My sentiments too, sir. Fight or<br>
  try to escape.</p>
<p align="center">21 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD</p>
<p align="center"> Turning to Troi:</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Sense anything, Commander?</p>
<p align="center"> TROI<br>
  (shakes head)<br>
  Its mind is much too powerful,<br>
  sir. And frightening. Concur we<br>
  avoid further contact if possible!</p>
<p align="center">22 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD</p>
<p align="center"> Clearly he has to come up with something. He reflects<br>
  for a moment more, then makes up his mind, turns to<br>
  Troi.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  From this point, no station<br>
  aboard, repeat no station, for<br>
  any reason will make use of<br>
  signals, transmission or intercom.<br>
  (crossing quickly to<br>
  Ops and Conn)<br>
  We'll try to take them by<br>
  surprise.<br>
  (to Worf)<br>
  Inform engineering to make ready<br>
  for maximum acceleration. We'll<br>
  find out what this Galaxy Class<br>
  can do.</p>
<p align="center"> WORF<br>
  Aye, sir.</p>
<p align="center"> As Worf stands and hurries off, Picard turns to Data.</p>
<p align="center">22 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Records search, Data. Results<br>
  of detaching the Saucer Section<br>
  at high warp speeds.</p>
<p align="center"> Data quickly draws on his memory.</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  Inadvisable at any warp speed,<br>
  sir.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Search theoretical.</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  (thinking; then)<br>
  It is possible, sir. But<br>
  absolutely no error margin.</p>
<p align="center"> Picard nods and stands, RAISES VOICE:</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Attention bridge crew!</p>
<p align="center">23 VARIOUS ANGLES</p>
<p align="center"> Picard waits until all are turned toward him.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (continuing)<br>
  Using print-out only, notify all<br>
  decks to prepare for maximum<br>
  acceleration. Maximum, you're<br>
  entitled to know, means we'll be<br>
  pushing our engines well past<br>
  safety limits. Our hope is to<br>
  surprise whatever that is out<br>
  there, try to outrun it.<br>
  (looks around, then)<br>
  Our only other option would be<br>
  to put tail between our legs and<br>
  return to Earth as they demand.</p>
<p align="center">24 INT. ENGINE ROOM - TRAVELING WITH WORF</p>
<p align="center"> As he takes us into WIDE CAMERA ANGLE, aiming both for<br>
  a feeling of the starship's huge size and enormous<br>
  power.</p>
<p align="center">25 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> Worf nodding at a reading which an Engineer shows him,<br>
  then EXITING to return to the bridge. Meanwhile,<br>
  engineering personnel work at their controls and a LOW<br>
  PITCHED WHINE quickly works itself up into a DEAFENING<br>
  HIGH PITCHED SHRIEK while ENERGY DISPLAYS APPEAR AT MAIN<br>
  ENGINE CONNECTIONS.</p>
<p align="center">26 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> Showing both the Enterprise and the mysterious grid.</p>
<p align="center">27 INT. BRIDGE - ANGLES INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER</p>
<p align="center"> Worf enters bridge from turbolift, crossing to his<br>
  position.</p>
<p align="center"> WORF<br>
  Engine room ready, sir.</p>
<p align="center"> Picard stands behind Data who is at the Conn position.</p>
<p align="center"> TROI<br>
  The board shows 'green', Captain.<br>
  All go!</p>
<p align="center"> Picard moving back to his command position as:</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Stand by...<br>
  (takes his seat, checks<br>
  bridge, then)<br>
  ENGAGE!</p>
<p align="center"> The entire bridge SHUDDERS under a SCREAM OF POWER as<br>
  we</p>
<p align="center"> CUT TO:</p>
<p align="center">28 EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> Suddenly into maximum warp, the energy release<br>
  momentarily DISTORTING BOTH THE ALIEN GRID AND THE STARS<br>
  IN SIGHT AROUND IT. When the EFFECT is over, the<br>
  starship has turned, seeming to almost brush against<br>
  the mysterious grid, and is then racing away from it.</p>
<p align="center">29 ANGLE EMPHASIZING GRID (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> With Enterprise in b.g. at warp speed, escaping. Then<br>
  the 'grid' suddenly shrinks in size, growing brighter<br>
  as it coalesces together INTO THE SHAPE OF A BRIGHTLY<br>
  COLORED SPINNING SHAPE which now races after the<br>
  Enterprise.</p>
<p align="center">30 INT. BRIDGE - VARIOUS ANGLES</p>
<p align="center"> The faces of the bridge crew reflect the fact that<br>
  Enterprise is at very high warp speed and continuing<br>
  to accelerate into even higher warp.</p>
<p align="center"> WORF<br>
  Velocity warp nine point two.</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  Heading, 351 Mark 11, sir.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Steady on that.</p>
<p align="center"> TASHA<br>
  The hostile is now giving chase,<br>
  sir. Accelerating fast.</p>
<p align="center"> WORF<br>
  We're now at Warp nine point<br>
  three, sir. Which takes us past<br>
  the red line, sir.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Continue accelerating.<br>
  (to Troi)<br>
  Counselor, at this point I'm open<br>
  even to guesses about what we've<br>
  just met.</p>
<p align="center"> TROI<br>
  (considers, then)<br>
  It... it felt like something beyond<br>
  what we'd consider a 'life form'.</p>

  TROI, TASHA</p>
<p align="center"> It is an immense courtroom meant to reflect strength<br>
  and power. (We'll discover that it dates back to the<br>
  mid-21st Century post-atomic crisis era.) Both decor<br>
  and legal procedures reflect the time when a desperate<br>
  humanity, still wounded and bleeding from nuclear war,<br>
  sought answers to its pain and problems through the<br>
  merciless strength of a new form of dictatorial<br>
  government representing neither capitalism nor<br>
  communism. Our four starship people are in old, ragged<br>
  and stained uniforms which 'demean' them as criminals.<br>
  In comparison with the gleaming steel and glass of the<br>
  rest of the courtroom, the Prisoner's Dock at which our<br>
  people sit is made of rough-hewn, hard and ugly wooden<br>
  benches. Suddenly, our Starfleet group is CAUGHT IN<br>
  A HARSH GLARING SPOTLIGHT. Data, looking around with<br>
  great curiosity, is the first to speak:</p>

<p align="center"> Important, the MANDARIN-BAILIFF is not a fun figure.<br>
  Despite the Asian robe and accent, he is an important<br>
  authority figure--and his expression and actions<br>
  underscore this. He caries a slim, portable view<br>
  screen, the face of which contains scrolled information<br>
  he will occasionally refer to. Now, as he nods to a<br>
  Court Functionary who uses an ancient, oriental bell,<br>
  DOLEFULLY CLANGING to gain attention.</p>

  to be intimidated into silence by a 21st CENTURY SOLDIER,<br>

  and Troi should not stand.</p>
<p align="center"> TROI<br>

  which gives &quot;his Honor&quot; physical access to every part<br>

  You are out of order!</p>
<p align="center"> But he's speaking to the downed military officer, not<br>
  to Tasha. Which turns out to be a sentence of death<br>
  -- carried out by a pair of Soldiers who step in,<br>
  raising their automatic weapons, FIRING at the Officer<br>
  lying on the floor. Spectators break into APPLAUSE as<br>
  the Officer slumps and lies unmoving.</p>

  Soldiers holding the guns at their heads, then to &quot;Q&quot;.<br>
  He seems to be taking too much time, and one of them<br>

<p align="center"> Picard's people can't help but show relief and even the<br>
  soldiers lighten up their stance and their grip on the<br>

<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (continuing)<br>
  ... provisionally so.</p>
<p align="center"> Surprised by this &quot;add on&quot;, the Soldiers begin bringing<br>
  their guns in close again, looking for guidance to &quot;Q&quot;<br>

<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (JUDGE)<br>

  Captain. But your test hardly<br>
  requires a 'long mission'.<br>

  Fascinating how in the midst of<br>

  fifteen-year-old son WESLEY.</p>
<p align="center">71 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> Like most other humans of this century, she doesn't look<br>
  her age. Although forty years old, she looks hardly<br>
  more than thirty. Her attractiveness is underscored<br>
  by a naturally provocative walk -- the woman can't help<br>
  it. This is counter-balanced by her quick intelligence<br>
  and her professional knowledge and skill as a physician.<br>
  Her son, Wes, has that same quick intelligence,<br>
  multiplied by four. That lively brain is ensconced in<br>
  the body of a perfectly normal boy with moderate good<br>
  looks, a cheerful personality, but with considerable<br>
  maturity for someone his age.</p>

  Mother, it's Commander Riker.</p>
<p align="center"> Beverly slows, lets Riker walk along with them. We see<br>

<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>

  scattering of alien vegetation too. It is a spacious<br>
  walkway with a number of pleasant shops and booths.<br>

  greyish life form, quiet and overly polite. Beverly,<br>
  Wesley and Riker move down a line of shops.</p>

<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>

  useful we could do while we wait.</p>
<p align="center">74 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> Beverly stops at a table in front of a shop selling<br>
  exotic materials. The modest selections of cloth are<br>
  lined up on the table, some draped for best effect.<br>
  Beverly looks over them critically, feeling weight and<br>
  texture. The Bandi SHOPKEEPER has stayed at the rear<br>
  of the booth.</p>
<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>
  &quot;Useful&quot;? How and what,<br>

<p align="center"> RIKER<br>

  of material which she holds up for the shopkeeper to<br>
  see.</p>
<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>
  Would this be available in emerald<br>
  green?</p>
<p align="center"> The Bandi Merchant smiles, nods and takes the bolt of<br>
  cloth INTO A SMALL CLOSED OFF AREA BEHIND. Wes watches<br>
  the merchant go as Beverly turns to look at Riker<br>
  appraisingly.</p>
<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>
  (continuing)<br>
  I'm sure, Commander, there are<br>
  reasons for a first officer to<br>
  want to demonstrate his energy<br>
  and alertness to a new captain.<br>
  But since my duty and interests<br>
  are outside the command<br>
  structure...</p>
<p align="center"> The Bandi Merchant comes quickly with the bolt of cloth<br>
  -- now emerald green -- interrupts Beverly by holding<br>
  it up for her approval.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Isn't it nice he happened to have<br>
  the right color?</p>
<p align="center"> Beverly glances sharply at Riker, suppressing a somewhat<br>
  chagrined look.</p>
<p align="center">74 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>
  (to Merchant)<br>
  Thank you. I'll take the entire<br>
  bolt. Charge it to Beverly<br>
  Crusher, Chief Medical Officer,<br>

  bolt of cloth.</p>
<p align="center">75 ANOTHER ANGLE - DOLLYING WITH BEVERLY, RIKER, WESLEY</p>

  I was accusing you of inventing<br>
  work in order to curry favor with<br>

<p align="center"> WESLEY<br>
  Finding the exact right color took<br>
  him only about twelve seconds,<br>

<p align="center"> LT. GEORDI LaFORGE and ENSIGN SAWYER MARKHAM are in the<br>

  young man, enthusiastic, energetic. He is still<br>
  inclined to shoot from the hip rather than consider<br>
  before speaking, but he is a capable (and very new)<br>
  graduate of the Academy. We SEE Geordi at first only<br>
  from behind, and we may routinely register the fact he<br>
  is black.</p>
<p align="center"> MARKHAM<br>
  Where is she? They say she's<br>

<p align="center">77 WIDER ANGLE</p>
<p align="center"> The two young men turn around sharply to find Riker has<br>
  come up behind them. The most important thing we notice<br>
  about Geordi is that he wears a strange flattish device<br>
  (like futuristic goggles) over his eyes. Although he<br>
  is technically blind, his head always turns toward the<br>
  person speaking to him because he can, in fact, see as<br>
  well or better than anyone through the use of the visual<br>
  prosthesis. As they realize that Riker is a senior<br>
  officer, both young men straighten to attention.</p>
<p align="center"> GEORDI/MARKHAM<br>
  Sir. Yes, sir.</p>
<p align="center"> Riker smiles at the ingrained and traditional response<br>

  The issue isn't what we call it,<br>

  is we can be dead certain...<br>

<p align="center">103 INT. PICARD'S CABIN</p>
<p align="center"> Much larger and more comfortable than the small battle<br>

  Come!</p>

<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (continuing)<br>

  Thank you, sir. I hope I show<br>
  some promise.</p>
<p align="center">103 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> An exchange of looks between the two. Clearly, Riker<br>

  Picard leads the way to a setting for coffee.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Some coffee.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  No thank you, sir.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (pours himself a cup)<br>
  And now I have a kind of &quot;what<br>
  sort of second-in-command have<br>
  I inherited?&quot; question.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Yes sir, I thought you might.</p>
<p align="center"> There's nothing disrespectful in Riker's tone of voice,<br>
  but he does leave an impression that he's not to be<br>
  walked on either.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  I noticed in your envelope that<br>
  Captain DeSoto thinks very highly<br>
  of you. One curious thing,<br>
  however, you refused to let him<br>
  beam down to Altair IV?</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  In my opinion, sir, Altair IV was<br>
  too dangerous to risk exposing<br>
  the captain.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  I see. A captain's rank means<br>
  nothing to you.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Rather the reverse, sir. A<br>
  captain's life means a great deal<br>
  to me.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Let me postulate something here,<br>
  Mister Riker. Isn't it just possible<br>
  that you don't get to be a<br>
  starship captain without knowing<br>
  when it's safe to beam down or<br>
  not? Isn't it a little<br>
  presumptuous for a first officer<br>
  to second guess his captain's<br>
  judgment?</p>
<p align="center">103 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Permission to speak candidly, sir?</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Always.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  You've been a first officer<br>
  yourself. You know that assuming<br>
  that responsibility must, by<br>
  definition, include the safety<br>
  of the captain. I have no problem<br>
  with following the rules you lay<br>
  down. But under no circumstances<br>
  will I compromise your safety.<br>
  If you have a problem with that,<br>
  sir, you can put me back on the<br>
  Hood before she leaves.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  You don't intend to back off that<br>
  position?</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  No, sir, I can't.</p>
<p align="center"> Picard takes another beat to study him carefully, then:</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  One further thing... a special<br>
  favor I have to ask of you.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Anything, sir.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Using the same kind of strength<br>
  you showed with Captain DeSoto,<br>
  I'd appreciate it if you can keep<br>
  me from making an ass of myself<br>
  with children.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Sir?</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  I'm not a family man, Riker, and<br>
  yet, Starfleet has given me a ship<br>
  with children aboard.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  (nods)<br>
  Yes, sir. And families...</p>
<p align="center">103 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  And I don't feel comfortable with<br>
  children. But, since a captain<br>
  needs an image of &quot;geniality&quot;<br>
  toward the little monsters, you're<br>
  to see that's exactly what I<br>
  project.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Aye, sir.</p>
<p align="center"> For the first time, Picard smiles, extending his hand.<br>
  We see he's surprisingly warm when he wants to be.<br>
  Riker takes Picard's hand for a firm and friendly<br>
  handshake.</p>

<p align="center"> WORF<br>
  Yes sir, Commander?</p>
<p align="center"> Riker crosses in, shakes hands.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Thank you, Lieutenant. Is<br>
  Commander Data on duty?</p>
<p align="center"> WORF<br>
  Commander Data is on a special<br>
  assignment, sir. He's using our<br>
  shuttlecraft to transfer an<br>
  admiral over to the Hood.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  An admiral?</p>
<p align="center"> WORF<br>
  He's been aboard all day, sir,<br>
  checking over medical layout.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Why the shuttlecraft? Can he just<br>
  beam over?</p>
<p align="center">104 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> WORF<br>
  I suppose he could, sir. But the<br>
  admiral's a rather remarkable man.</p>
<p align="center">105 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR - ANGLE AT INTERSECTION</p>

<p align="center"> Data and the admiral ENTER SCENE at the intersection.<br>
  The admiral is very old with an almost transparent look.</p>
<p align="center"> ADMIRAL<br>
  Have you got some reason to want<br>
  my atoms scattered all over space?</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  No sir. But at your age, sir,<br>
  I thought you shouldn't have to<br>
  put up with the time and trouble<br>
  of a shuttlecraft.</p>
<p align="center"> The admiral stops. Facing Data, he draws himself. up<br>
  as straight as he can. His voice is crotchety and<br>

<p align="center"> ADMIRAL<br>
  My age? Hold it right there, boy,<br>
  what about my age?</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  Sorry, sir. If that subject<br>

<p align="center"> ADMIRAL<br>
  Troubles me? What's so damned<br>
  troubling about not having died?<br>
  How old do you think I am?</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  One hundred forty-seven years,<br>

<p align="center"> ADMIRAL<br>
  I don't see any points on your<br>

<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  No, sir. I am an android.</p>
<p align="center"> ADMIRAL<br>

  Almost as bad.</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  (at a loss, but still<br>

<p align="center"> The admiral stares at him a moment, his severe blue eyes<br>
  gentling and his feisty scowl fading. He pats Data's<br>
  sleeve and nods slightly.</p>
<p align="center"> ADMIRAL<br>
  They are, boy. They are. And<br>
  also damned annoying at times.</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  Yes, sir.</p>

  effect on the way I serve you,<br>
  this vessel, or this mission.</p>
<p align="center"> Picard gives it a moment's thought, extends his hand.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Then, welcome aboard, Doctor.<br>
  I'm pleased to have you here.</p>
<p align="center"> Beverly allows only a perfunctory handshake.</p>
<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>
  Thank you. And now, if I can<br>
  return to my duties...</p>
<p align="center"> It is clear that Picard wanted to say more but she has<br>
  neatly blocked any further conversation.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (uncomfortably)<br>
  Well... as I said, &quot;welcome<br>
  Aboard&quot;.</p>
<p align="center"> She doesn't respond further and he has no choice but<br>
  to turn and exit.</p>
<p align="center">111 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND HOOD IN ORBIT (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> Again, EMPHASIZING the considerable difference in the<br>

  Enterprise requires minimal monitoring at this time.</p>
<p align="center">113 ANGLE ON TURBOLIFT DOORS</p>

<p align="center"> PICARD<br>

<p align="center"> MAIN VIEWER FLICKERS, then startles us with an ugly<br>
  FLASH OF LIGHT that becomes an IMAGE OF &quot;Q&quot; (JUDGE)<br>
  who is in LIMBO, but looking directly at Picard. His<br>
  VOICE BOOMS LOUDLY, annoyed in tone:</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (JUDGE)<br>
  DO YOU EXPECT ME TO WAIT PATIENTLY<br>
  THROUGH ALL THIS NONSENSE? OR<br>
  DID YOU THINK I WAS GONE?</p>
<p align="center"> Picard is as startled as Riker. The young Klingon,<br>
  Worf, comes tumbling out of the conn position, drawing<br>
  his phaser and placing himself protectively between<br>
  Picard and the threatening &quot;Q&quot; image.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Do you intend to blast a hole<br>
  through the viewer, Lieutenant?</p>
<p align="center"> Worf apologetically puts his phaser away, lets Picard<br>
  wave him aside.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>

<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Of course you will. We've a long<br>

  takes the sting out of what he just said.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  (lowers voice)<br>
  Hope you're right, sir. About<br>
  the long voyage ahead.</p>
<p align="center"> Picard looks to main viewer as if checking that &quot;Q&quot; 
  is<br>
  truly gone.</p>

<p align="center"> VARIOUS ANGLES - AS APPROPRIATE</p>
<p align="center"> As Riker, Data and Wes move INTO SHOT with Picard. Wes<br>
  is instantly aware that his soaked clothing is dripping<br>
  water onto the starship deck. He'd like to remove<br>
  himself but knows that Picard has already seen his<br>
  puddle forming on the deck.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Mister Data has agreed to join<br>
  my away team, Captain.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (with another glance<br>
  toward Wes's puddle)<br>
  Very good.</p>
<p align="center"> WES<br>
  Sir, maybe I should get something<br>
  to wipe this water up.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (coolly)<br>
  Good idea.</p>
<p align="center"> Picard turns and EXITS.</p>
<p align="center">147 INT. SICKBAY - BEVERLY AND WESLEY</p>
<p align="center"> Wesley is wiping himself dry now. He is<br>
  enthusiastically trying to explain his adventures.</p>
<p align="center"> WESLEY<br>
  -- and there's a low gravity<br>
  gymnasium, too. It would be hard<br>
  to get bored on this ship.</p>
<p align="center">148 CLOSER TWO SHOT - BEVERLY AND WESLEY</p>
<p align="center"> As he wipes, he's been turning something over in his<br>

<p align="center"> WESLEY<br>
  Mom...<br>
  (beat)<br>
  could you get me a look at the<br>
  bridge?</p>
<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>
  That's against the captain's<br>
  standing orders.</p>
<p align="center"> WESLEY<br>
  Are you afraid of the captain,<br>
  too?</p>
<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>
  I certainly am not!</p>
<p align="center"> WESLEY<br>
  But Captain Picard is a pain,<br>
  isn't he?</p>
<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>
  Your father liked him very much.<br>
  Great explorers are often lonely,<br>
  ... no chance to have a family...</p>
<p align="center"> WESLEY<br>
  Just a look, at the bridge, Mom.<br>
  From the turbolift when the doors<br>
  open. I wouldn't get off. I<br>
  promise.</p>
<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>
  You're looking for trouble, Wes.</p>
<p align="center"> He shuts up. Beverly looks at him and can't ignore the<br>
  very real want in his eyes.</p>
<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>
  (continuing)<br>
  Let's see what we can do.</p>
<p align="center"> On Wes's delighted grin:</p>
<p align="center"> CUT TO:</p>
<p align="center">149 EXT. FARPOINT STATION/CITY - DAY - EMPHASIZING STATION</p>
<p align="center"> TO ESTABLISH our location.</p>
<p align="center">150 INT. STATION SHOPPING AREA - DAY - ON AWAY TEAM</p>
<p align="center"> Which is made up of Riker, Data, Troi, Tasha and Geordi.<br>
  There are a number of people in the mall area, some in<br>
  identifiable Enterprise-type uniforms. The others are<br>
  in various civilian clothes. They are taking in the<br>
  Bandi shops, booths, food and drink offered by Bandi<br>
  vendors.</p>
<p align="center"> TASHA<br>
  Recommend that someone could begin<br>
  by examining the underside of the<br>
  station, sir.</p>
<p align="center"> TROI<br>
  Our sensors do show some passages<br>
  down there, sir. Perhaps you and<br>
  I?</p>
<p align="center"> Troi glances at Riker with just a shade of archness,<br>
  perhaps the lift of an eyebrow. Riker glances away,<br>
  troubled.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Tasha, you and the Counselor.</p>
<p align="center"> Troi and Tasha move off. Riker turns to Geordi.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Let's us start with the topside.<br>
  Have you noticed anything unusual?</p>
<p align="center"> Riker and the others move out of scene, examining<br>
  everything they pass.</p>
<p align="center"> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<p align="center">151 INT. ANOTHER STATION AREA</p>
<p align="center"> ON GEORDI as he looks around the area, moving slowly<br>
  and carefully scanning. Then he shakes his head.</p>
<p align="center"> GEORDI<br>
  Well, I can't see through solid<br>
  matter, sir, but the material so<br>
  far looks very ordinary.</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  Confirmed by the construction<br>
  records, sir. Almost exactly the<br>
  same material that Starfleet uses.</p>
<p align="center"> Riker reaches to his insignia, to switch on his<br>
  communicator.</p>
<p align="center">151 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Riker to Tasha, Troi, come in!</p>
<p align="center"> We milk the next few moments, Riker growing<br>
  apprehensive. Then, finally, with Riker showing relief:</p>
<p align="center"> TASHA'S VOICE<br>
  (from communicator)<br>
  We were about to call you, Team<br>
  Leader. We've found something<br>
  interesting.</p>
<p align="center">152 INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY</p>
<p align="center"> Not at all what one would expect of a &quot;service tunnel&quot;,<br>
  if this is indeed that. These are smooth, rounded,<br>
  glistening walls whose GLOW lights up the entire<br>
  passageway. (We'll see something similar later on a<br>
  mystery vessel). Tasha is activating her communicator.</p>
<p align="center"> TASHA<br>
  We're in a passageway directly<br>
  under the station sir. But the<br>
  tunnel walls here are make from<br>
  something we've never seen before.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER'S VOICE<br>
  And Troi, have you sensed anything<br>
  there?</p>
<p align="center"> Troi appears reluctant as she activates her<br>
  communicator.</p>
<p align="center"> TROI<br>
  Sir, I've avoided opening my mind.<br>
  Whatever I sensed in the<br>
  Groppler's office became very<br>
  painful.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  I'm sorry, Counselor, but you<br>
  must. We need more information.</p>
<p align="center"> Troi complies... then her face contorts in agony and<br>
  a SMALL SCREAM ESCAPES. She sinks to her knees, Tasha<br>
  hurrying in to support her.</p>
<p align="center"> TROI<br>
  (continuing)<br>
  No, no, such pain. It's so close to<br>
  us here... pain, pain..</p>
<p align="center">152 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER'S VOICE<br>
  (overlapping)<br>
  Hang on, I'm coming... Enterprise,<br>
  lock us onto her signal!</p>
<p align="center"> Tasha has her arm around Troi, whispering words of<br>
  comfort.</p>
<p align="center">153 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> After a moment, the familiar TRANSPORTER SOUND BEGINS.<br>
  Riker, Data, and Geordi BEAM IN, SOLIDIFY. Then Riker<br>
  hurries over to Troi while Data and Geordi examine their<br>
  surroundings with great curiosity.</p>
<p align="center">154 ANGLE ON TROI</p>
<p align="center"> Riker helping her very tenderly:</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  I'm sorry. Close your mind from<br>

<p align="center"> TROI<br>
  It's also unhappiness... terrible<br>
  despair...</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Who?</p>
<p align="center"> TROI<br>
  I don't know! No lifeform anything<br>
  like us.</p>
<p align="center"> Riker is looking around at the glowing walls.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  What in the hell kind of place<br>
  is this?<br>
  (turning)<br>
  Geordi, what do you see?</p>
<p align="center"> Geordi has been inspecting the wall closely. He shakes<br>
  his head.</p>
<p align="center"> GEORDI<br>
  It's of no material I recognize,<br>
  sir. Or have even heard of.</p>

<p align="center"> standing just inside the turbolift door. Beverly is<br>
  uncomfortable; Wes is all eyes, taking in as much as<br>

  to stay in the turbolift.</p>
<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>

<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>

  me on the turbolift.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Your son?</p>
<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>
  His name's Wesley. You last saw<br>
  him years ago when...</p>
<p align="center"> She trails her words; Picard understands.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Oh, back then.</p>
<p align="center"> He glances from Beverly to Wesley, clears his throat.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (continuing)<br>
  Well -- as long as he's here...</p>
<p align="center">159 WIDER - INCLUDING WESLEY, BEVERLY, PICARD</p>
<p align="center"> Wesley looks to Picard hopefully. Beverly waits, then<br>
  Picard shrugs, tries to sound friendly.</p>
<p align="center">159 CONTINUED:</p>

  a look around?</p>
<p align="center"> Wesley is out like a shot.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (continuing; quickly)<br>
  But don't touch anything!</p>
<p align="center"> Wes is in awe. To him, this is the equivalent of a<br>
  devout Catholic stepping into the nave of St. Peter's<br>
  Basilica. The turbolift is on the level of the<br>
  &quot;horseshoe&quot;, so the command positions are spread below<br>
  him. Picard moves down to the captain's chair level,<br>
  Wes moving with him. He is careful to put his feet down<br>
  just right so he doesn't even scuff the floor. Picard<br>
  watches, steps aside to gesture toward the command<br>
  chair.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (continuing)<br>
  Try it out.<br>
  (as Wes does so)<br>
  The panel on your right is for<br>

  control, intercoms, and so on.</p>
<p align="center"> WESLEY<br>
  (nodding; pointing)<br>
  Yes sir. And here, the backup conn<br>

  shield controls.</p>
<p align="center"> Picard looks closely at Wes, perplexed.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  The forward viewscreen is<br>

<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  How the hell do you know that,<br>
  boy?</p>
<p align="center"> Before Beverly or Wes can reply, a VERY DISTINCTIVE<br>
  SIGNAL SOUNDS (Captain's comm signal) and Wes, closest<br>
  to the control, transfers the signal into audio as:</p>
<p align="center">159 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
<p align="center"> WES<br>
  Perimeter alert, Captain!</p>
<p align="center"> Wesley is instantly embarrassed; Beverly is mortified;<br>
  Picard is ang7ry.</p>
<p align="center"> WES BEVERLY<br>
  I'm sorry. I didn't mean Wes! You shouldn't<br>
  to... have touched anything...</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Off the bridge! Both of you.</p>
<p align="center"> Worf has come to his feet, not sure whether or not he<br>
  should respond to the call. Beverly is hustling Wesley<br>
  toward the turbolift.</p>
<p align="center"> WORF<br>

<p align="center">224 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> As Data and Riker raise their phasers toward Zorn.</p>
<p align="center"> ZORN<br>
  (in terror)<br>
  No, no, please don't!</p>
<p align="center"> Data and Riker trigger their phasers and we SEE a SORT<br>
  OF COLORED GLOW on the FORCEFIELD HOLDING Zorn, the GLOW<br>
  SPREADING OVER THE ENTIRE FORCEFIELD. Then, suddenly<br>
  the FORCEFIELD DISAPPEARS, GLOW AND ALL, and Zorn<br>
  tumbles out onto the floor free of restraint.</p>
<p align="center">225 EMPHASIZING &quot;LIVE&quot; PART OF CELL WALL (EFFECTS)</p>
<p align="center"> Where the wall seems to be &quot;alive&quot;, undulating. Beyond<br>
  it, Tasha is assisting Zorn to his feet, supporting him.<br>
  Meanwhile, Troi looks around Zorn's &quot;cell&quot;, sensing<br>
  something troubling. Riker has turned on his<br>
  communicator:</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Away team to Enterprise...</p>
<p align="center"> A TENDRIL OF PLASMA EMERGES FROM THIS PART OF THE WALL,<br>
  swaying and moving toward Troi.</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  (interrupting; warning)<br>
  Troi... !</p>
<p align="center"> But the TENDRIL is already wrapping around her. Data<br>
  tries to pull the TENDRIL from Troi, succeeds only in<br>
  getting a NEW TENDRIL wrapped around himself.</p>
<p align="center">226 ANOTHER ANGLE (EFFECTS)</p>
<p align="center"> The floor of the area suddenly going soft, away team<br>
  members sinking into it while still ANOTHER SECTION OF<br>
  WALL FOLDS ITSELF OVER TASHA. (What we're seeing is<br>
  this part of the mystery &quot;vessel&quot; becoming a living<br>
  thing.)</p>
<p align="center">226 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Enterprise, come in. Beam us...</p>
<p align="center"> Interrupted as his feet are YANKED OUT FROM UNDER HIM.</p>

  Now!</p>
<p align="center"> WORF<br>
  Captain... !</p>
<p align="center">228 ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> Toward which Lieutenant Worf is pointing. On it the<br>
  IMAGE of the mystery vessel is BEGINNING TO CHANGE IN<br>
  SHAPE. The firm, hard edges of the spaceship are giving<br>
  way to something softer, very mysterious in nature.</p>
<p align="center">229 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> In which we SEE a familiar BLINDING FLASH and &quot;Q&quot;<br>
  appears, now wearing the uniform of a STARFLEET CAPTAIN.</p>

  Your time is up, Captain.</p>

<p align="center">230 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; gestures upward, at which Picard is suddenly 
  lifted<br>
  into the air and then to the side of &quot;Q&quot;'s hand motion<br>
  in that direction.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  &quot;Q&quot;, I've people in trouble over<br>
  there... !</p>
<p align="center"> As Picard hovers above, &quot;Q&quot; steps up and sits in<br>
  Picard's command position. Bridge personnel are coming<br>
  to their feet angrily, then hesitate as:</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (continuing)<br>
  Everyone, at ease! That's an<br>
  order!<br>
  (to &quot;Q&quot;)<br>
  My people are in trouble, &quot;Q&quot;.<br>
  Help them; I'll do whatever you<br>

  is gently deposited onto the deck.</p>

<p align="center"> As the same strange transporter SOUND that accompanied<br>
  Zorn's &quot;kidnapping&quot; is heard and the same STRANGE<br>
  TRANSPORTER EFFECT APPEARS, this time MATERIALIZING FIVE<br>
  IMAGES -- Riker, Data, Troi, Tasha, and Groppler Zorn.</p>
<p align="center">232 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD</p>
<p align="center"> Very surprised, looking from his away team to &quot;Q&quot;.</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (STARFLEET)<br>
  You'll do whatever I say?</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (hesitates; nods)<br>
  It seems I did make that bargain.</p>
<p align="center"> TROI<br>
  The agreement isn't valid, sir.<br>
  It wasn't &quot;Q&quot; that saved us.</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (STARFLEET)<br>

  Save yourselves! It may attack<br>
  you now.</p>
<p align="center">233 ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> On which the changed IMAGE of the mystery &quot;vessel&quot; 
  seems<br>
  to be floating in closer to the Enterprise.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  It was that which sent us back,<br>
  Captain.</p>
<p align="center"> TROI<br>
  Yes sir. It's not a vessel, sir.<br>
  It's alive somehow...</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (STARFLEET)<br>
  She lies! Destroy it while you<br>
  have a chance.<br>
  (to Tasha)<br>
  Make phasers and photon torpedoes<br>
  ready... !</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  No! Do nothing he suggests!</p>
<p align="center"> ZORN<br>
  But that thing was killing my<br>
  people, Captain...</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  True, but why? Was there a<br>
  reason?</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (STARFLEET)<br>
  It is an unknown, Captain! Isn't<br>
  that enough?</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  If you had earned that uniform<br>
  you're wearing, you'd know that<br>
  the unknown is what brings us out<br>
  here!</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (STARFLEET)<br>
  Wasted effort, considering the<br>
  human intelligence.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Let's test that...<br>
  (to Zorn)<br>
  ... starting with the tunnels you<br>
  have under Farpoint, Groppler.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Identical to the ones on that<br>
  space vessel lifeform, over there.<br>
  Why was it punishing you,<br>
  Groppler?</p>
<p align="center">233 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  In return for pain you caused to<br>
  some other creature?</p>
<p align="center"> ZORN<br>
  We did nothing wrong! It was<br>
  injured, we helped it...</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (interrupting; to Zorn)<br>
  Thank you, that was the missing<br>
  part.<br>
  (turns)<br>
  Tasha, rig phasers to deliver an<br>
  energy beam.</p>
<p align="center"> TASHA<br>
  (puzzled)<br>
  Aye, sir.</p>
<p align="center"> Tasha steps to her panel, makes settings on controls<br>
  there.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Yes, Captain, I understand now.<br>
  It has to be conceivable that<br>
  somewhere in the galaxy there<br>
  could exist creatures able to<br>
  convert energy into matter...</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (nodding)<br>
  And into specific patterns of<br>
  matter. Much as our transporters<br>
  do.</p>
<p align="center"> TASHA<br>
  (indicating)<br>
  On the viewer, Captain!</p>
<p align="center">234 ANGLE EMPHASIZING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> Where the vessel/creature IMAGE is SOFTENING FURTHER<br>
  INTO AN AMORPHOUS, COLORFUL AND LOVELY SHAPE. Picard<br>
  turns to the Groppler, demanding:</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Zorn, you captured something like<br>
  that, didn't you?</p>
<p align="center"> On main viewer, the IMAGE NOW SHOWS LOVELY FEATHERY<br>
  TENDRILS, and it is BEGINNING TO MOVE DOWN TOWARD THE<br>
  PLANET. Zorn reacts to this, shows panic.</p>
<p align="center">234 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> ZORN<br>
  Warn my people, please! Leave<br>
  Farpoint Station immediately!</p>
<p align="center"> &quot;Q&quot; (STARFLEET)<br>
  He's lied to you, Captain.<br>
  Shouldn't you let his people die?</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (nods to Ops)<br>
  Transmit the message. &quot;Leave<br>
  Farpoint immediately&quot;.</p>
<p align="center"> TROI<br>
  Then it was a pair of creatures<br>
  I was sensing. One down there<br>
  in grief and pain, the other up<br>
  here, filled with anger...</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  (nodding)<br>

<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
