  <p> TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>A1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> moving at sub-warp.</p>
  <p>1 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Minimum BRIDGE CREW -- TASHA; GEORDI is at Conn; DATA at<br>
    Ops; RIKER and PICARD in the Command Position. WORF<br>
    turns from his Aft Station.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain! Communication from<br>
    Starfleet. They have recorded<br>
    a disturbance in the Neutral Zone.</p>
  <p>2 REACTIONS</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is the nature of the<br>
    disturbance?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A battle. Quadrant nine --<br>
    coordinates zero-seven-zero, mark<br>
    three. No information who is<br>
    involved. They are asking if we<br>
    can investigate.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Answer &quot;affirmative.&quot;<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Lieutenant La Forge, lay in the<br>
    course.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, I have no reports of any<br>
    Federation ships in that area.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ferengi?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's a little out of their area.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - REV. 1/14/88 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Should we separate the saucer?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's get some more information<br>
    first.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Course set.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Speed -- warp seven.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Warp seven. Aye.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Engage.</p>
  <p>3 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it warps towards us.</p>
  <p>4 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p>It's very tense. Worf at Science; Data at Ops; Picard --<br>
    alert, watching.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We are approaching the Neutral<br>
    Zone.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Sir... Sensors indicate several<br>
    recent photon explosions and heavy<br>
    phaser activity.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have analyzed the residue of<br>
    the explosives. They are not of<br>
    any known Ferengi design. It is<br>
    possibly Romulan.</p>
  <p> Picard REACTS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - 1/13/88 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's a name we haven't heard<br>
    for a while.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And I could have gone a lot longer<br>
    without hearing it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If the Romulans have returned to<br>
    this sector we should know about<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Shall we move to the Battle<br>
    bridge?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not yet. Worf, any further<br>
    activity?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Negative, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Slow to half impulse.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Slowing to one-half impulse.</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship comes out of warp speed.</p>
  <p>6 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Everyone is tense and expectant.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Entering quadrant nine-zero-seven,<br>
    mark three.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Shields and deflectors up.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have located a ship. It is<br>
    drifting.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - REV. 1/15/88 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On the Main Viewer.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p>7 ANGLE TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> There is a distant ship.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Magnify!</p>
  <p> The IMAGE on the Screen INCREASES in size. It is now<br>
    possible to see extensive battle damage.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The life-support systems on the<br>
    ship are failing, propulsion,<br>
    navigation, and all<br>
    communication, inoperative.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any trace of the other ship?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    None, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If it is a Romulan vessel, it<br>
    could be cloaked.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Send this to Starfleet. We are<br>
    entering the Neutral Zone.<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Get us in a little closer, Mister<br>
    La Forge. Stay sharp everyone.</p>
  <p>8 OMITTED</p>
  <p>9 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> which displays THE BATRIS. Everyone studies the damaged<br>
    vessel as the Enterprise moves around it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - 1/13/88 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's Talarian.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any life signs?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Nothing yet.</p>
  <p> There is a lot of tension.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have identified the vessel.<br>
    It is the Batris. A general<br>
    cargo vessel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Long way from home.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stay sharp. If this is a result<br>
    of a Romulan attack, they could<br>
    still be in the area.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain. Possible life signs.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What do you mean &quot;possible?&quot;</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I cannot be positive. The<br>
    readings emanate from a location<br>
    near what is left of Main<br>
    Engineering. There is a great<br>
    deal of magnetic and radioactive<br>
    clutter making a positive<br>
    determination difficult.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll prepare an away team.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant Yar, remain at your<br>
    post. Whoever attacked the<br>
    freighter may still be in the<br>
    area.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (reluctantly)<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - 1/13/88 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, Geordi. Let's go.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant La Forge, are we close<br>
    enough to use the Visual Acuity<br>
    transmitter?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We can try it, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then please do. And Number One -<br>
    everything about this seems wrong.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Agreed. It smells like a trap.</p>
  <p> And they DEPART.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - REV. 1/14/88 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>10 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it slowly APPROACHES the other ship.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 41503.7.<br>
    We have entered the Neutral Zone.<br>
    A Talarian freighter has been<br>
    severely damaged in a battle.<br>
    Why, and with whom is unknown.<br>
    Personal note: I hope this event<br>
    is not a precursor of things to<br>
    come, and that the peace which<br>
    has endured for the last several<br>
    decades will continue.</p>
  <p>11 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Riker, Data and Geordi have gathered and are preparing<br>
    to beam over. A check of equipment. Geordi clips on<br>
    the transmitter for his VISOR.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What exactly does that device do?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data and I have been working on<br>
    a way to transmit what my VISOR<br>
    sees. If it works, the bridge<br>
    will be able to monitor us.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is very restricted. The signal<br>
    from Geordi's VISOR is so complex<br>
    that it is difficult to encode<br>
    and breaks down easily.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That means it doesn't have much<br>
    range.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Correct. The effective range is<br>
    a few kilometers, but we're<br>
    working on that.<br>
    (touches communicator)<br>
    Bridge, this is Lieutenant La<br>
    Forge.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - 1/13/88 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    This is the bridge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I have attached the Visual Acuity<br>
    Transmitter.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    We are receiving.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I am switching off.</p>
  <p>12 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as they gather on the Transporter Pad.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Set phasers on stun.</p>
  <p> They all check their weapons.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Let's be ready for anything.</p>
  <p> He takes a quick, final look at his team.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing; to the<br>
    TRANSPORTER CHIEF)<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p>13 INT. BATRIS - CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The corridor is very DIMLY LIGHTED. There is evidence<br>
    of the recent battle everywhere. Charred walls -<br>
    damaged bulkheads. The transporter effect brings the<br>
    away team INTO THE SCENE. They are very tense. Data<br>
    scans with his tricorder as the others look around.</p>
  <p>14 GEORDI</p>
  <p> steps slightly to the side.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    La Forge to Enterprise.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - 1/13/88 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>15 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard on the bridge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain, I am switching on the<br>
    transmitter.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ready to receive.<br>
    (to the bridge crew)<br>
    Put this on the Main Viewer.</p>
  <p> He leans forward as the IMAGE COMES ON the Screen.<br>
    For the first time, Picard sees as Geordi sees.<br>
    (Pattern and image to be determined.)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Extraordinary.</p>
  <p>16 INTERCUT</p>
  <p> The other members of the bridge crew as they, too,<br>
    REACT with astonishment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand him better than I<br>
    ever have.</p>
  <p>17 MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi's VISIONS. (TBD)</p>
  <p>18 ANGLE ON PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> For a moment all else is forgotten as he is consumed<br>
    by the image on the Main Viewer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Geordi. What was that? Over to<br>
    the left.</p>
  <p> Geordi looks to the left.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - 1/13/88 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That -- right there? No -- back.<br>
    Yes. That -- right there. What<br>
    is it?</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    It's Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    To me it's just an undefined<br>
    upright form, standing in a wild<br>
    visual frenzy. Can you filter out<br>
    the extraneous information?</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    No, I get it all simultaneously.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's a jumble. How can you make<br>
    heads or tails of it?</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    I select what I want to see and<br>
    disregard the rest.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How is that possible?</p>
  <p>19 INT. BATRIS - CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Geordi chuckles.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    How, in a noisy room, can you pick<br>
    out one specific voice or sound?</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    It's something you learn.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Exactly. It's something I have<br>
    learned. Does that make it<br>
    clearer?</p>
  <p>20 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard stares at the viewscreen, trying to accomplish<br>
    in minutes what took Geordi a lifetime to learn.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - REV. 1/14/88 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. Look over at Data.</p>
  <p> Geordi complies and WE SEE the difference between them<br>
    from Geordi's point of view.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There's an aura around Data.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yes, of course. He's an android.</p>
  <p>21 INT. BATRIS - CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Data and Riker are getting impatient with this<br>
    conversation.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    From the way you say that, you<br>
    must think we all see it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Don't you?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain - I don't mean to break<br>
    this up, but...</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yes, of course, Number One.<br>
    Proceed.</p>
  <p> Riker leads the away team down the corridor.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am detecting high levels of<br>
    Deuterium gas. Probably coming<br>
    from the leakage in the drive<br>
    system.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Toxic?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Not as yet.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - 1/13/88 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>22 OMITTED</p>
  <p>23 INT. BATRIS - ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> As the members of the Enterprise move forward, the<br>
    damage becomes move extensive. They pause at an<br>
    intersection.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The life signs are emanating from<br>
    the far side of Engineering.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's the safest way around?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    All routes are equally dangerous.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Which one is the least dangerous?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is no significant<br>
    difference.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then steady on.</p>
  <p> Geordi notices something.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Commander, a fissure is developing<br>
    in the bulkhead. The skin of the<br>
    ship is losing its integrity.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where? I don't see it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There.</p>
  <p> Riker looks, but still cannot see anything except the<br>
    charred bulkhead.</p>
  <p>24 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard is standing in front of the Main Viewer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    It looks to me like a spectrograph<br>

    The life signs are very strong<br>
    now. They are coming from over<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is there any other way around?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Negative. This is the only way.<br>
    I think the safest way to proceed<br>
    is for me to cross alone. The<br>
    heat and toxic gases have less<br>

  <p> What Picard saw was Data RETURNING. He pauses halfway<br>
    across the Engineering compartment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I found them. The door to their<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    The control mechanism. It is<br>
    inoperative.</p>
  <p> Riker squeezes his arm through a twisted piece of metal<br>
    and pounds on the door.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is Commander Riker of the<br>
    USS Enterprise. Can you hear me?</p>
  <p> There is no response.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I advise against the use of<br>
    phasers. The gas buildup is too<br>
    great, Commander.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes. A phaser discharge now could<br>

    We are about to force the door.</p>
  <p>40 INT. BATRIS - DOOR TO AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM</p>
  <p> as Data steps closer to the door. With considerable<br>
    difficulty he wedges one hand in between the sliding<br>
    door panels. Then slowly he gets the other hand in<br>
    place. Data, now with both hands in between the door<br>
    panels, puts his great strength to work again, and<br>
    slowly pries the doors APART.</p>

    them all the door is OPENED. Riker STEPS THROUGH.</p>
  <p>44 INT. BATRIS - ENGINEERING COMPARTMENT</p>
  <p> As Riker ENTERS the room he sees TWO BLURRED FIGURES.<br>
    The first steps forward. It's dreamlike. A figure<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am Jean-Luc Picard, the captain<br>
    of this vessel.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    My name is Korris -- captain of<br>
    the Klingon Defense Force. This<br>
    is Lieutenant Konmel.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you mind telling me what<br>
    happened?</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    Not at all.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Firstly, what were you doing on<br>
    that ship? It's not Klingon.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    We were passengers. The Talarians<br>
    were taking us to outpost<br>
    M-Zed-Five.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What was the ship doing in the<br>
    Neutral Zone?</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    We were attacked without warning<br>
    by a Ferengi cruiser. During the<br>
    course of the battle we must have<br>
    unknowingly entered the Neutral<br>
    Zone.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The weapons were not Ferengi.</p>
  <p> Now the two Klingons turn their full attention on Worf.<br>
    It's a time for evaluation.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    What is your name?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am Lieutenant Worf.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    And you are a member of this<br>
    crew?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - 1/13/88 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Korris pauses a beat, then continues.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    You are correct. The weapons were<br>
    Klingon, but the vessel was<br>
    Ferengi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What precipitated the attack?</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    I don't know -- we were in our<br>
    quarters.</p>
  <p> KONMEL<br>
    The captain of the freighter had<br>
    no combat experience so he did<br>
    not anticipate the first attack,<br>
    which was nearly fatal.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    We took control -- with his<br>
    permission. The Ferengi called<br>
    for surrender. I told the captain<br>
    to agree to all their terms. We<br>
    had one chance -- I was confident<br>
    it would be enough.</p>
  <p> KONMEL<br>
    As adversaries the Ferengi are<br>
    not very worthy.</p>
  <p> Worf listens with relish to the story of the battle.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Still, your weapons were limited,<br>
    and their ship superior.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    Yes -- all we had was an ancient<br>
    battery of Merculite rockets.<br>
    Our only chance was to trick them<br>
    into lowering their shields.</p>
  <p> KONMEL<br>
    We reduced power and lured them<br>
    in.</p>

  <p>59 CONTINUED: (3)</p>

    They suspected nothing.</p>
  <p> KONMEL<br>
    Then, when they lowered their<br>
    shields to beam over a boarding<br>
    party, we opened fire.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Your strategy was very sound.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There are still a few items that<br>
    are not clear.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    Captain -- we are hungry and tired.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, of course.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    If there is anything more you need<br>
    to know about this incident -- we<br>
    will be available.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> Worf leads them OUT of Sickbay.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What do you think, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's a lot more to this than<br>
    we've been told. Why was the<br>
    Talarian ship so far off course?<br>
    What was its point of departure?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And why would three Klingon<br>
    officers hitch a ride on a broken-down<br>

    tell, there comes a LOW RUMBLING GROWL as the moment<br>
    of death approaches. Then -- with a SHUDDER it happens.<br>
    The wounded man dies. For a beat, Korris continues to<br>
    stare into the dead man's eyes. Then, like an<br>

    inside them. It is not the WAIL of the dead, but the<br>
    exaltation of the victorious. Then -- as one, they<br>
    stop. The looks they exchange between them are the<br>

  <p> Worf, Korris and Konmel walk along.</p>
  <p> KONMEL<br>
    The opponent that killed Kunivas<br>
    should have been an enemy -- then<br>
    his death would have been even<br>
    more glorious.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (stunned by the<br>
    revelation)<br>
    If the opponent was not an<br>
    enemy... who was it?</p>
  <p> For a beat, neither Korris nor Konmel answer.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Tell me -- what really happened?</p>
  <p> Korris gives Worf a long steady gaze.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    I do not wish to anger you. We<br>
    are after all, brothers lost among<br>
    the infidels.<br>
    (he pauses; then)<br>
    How did you come to this ship and<br>
    that uniform?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Through an act of kindness. The<br>
    Romulans attacked the Khitomer<br>
    outpost. Everyone was killed.<br>
    I was buried under the rubble and<br>
    left for dead. A human Starfleet<br>
    officer found me. He took me to<br>
    his home on Gault and told his<br>
    wife to raise me as his son.</p>

  <p>74 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KONMEL<br>
    How old were you?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Before the age of inclusion --</p>
  <p> KONMEL<br>
    That young?</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    (with disdain)<br>
    Gault is a farming colony.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    When my foster brother and I were<br>
    of age we entered the Starfleet<br>
    Academy. He hated it and returned<br>
    to Gault. I stayed.</p>
  <p> KONMEL<br>
    You haven't spent much time among<br>
    your own kind.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Almost none.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    So when the night was still and<br>
    quiet, and the sound of the blood<br>
    rushing through your veins filled<br>
    your ears, the only way to<br>
    silence it was to slip out into<br>
    the night and, like the hunter<br>
    that spawned you, join in the<br>
    struggle of life and death... but<br>
    you were unable...</p>
  <p> KONMEL<br>
    ... And those around you did not<br>
    understand. You frightened them.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    They shunned you. Cursed you.<br>
    Called you vile names, and you<br>
    knew not why. Even now do you<br>
    know why you are driven? Why you<br>
    cannot relent -- or repent -- or<br>
    confess -- or abstain? How could<br>
    you know? There have been no other<br>
    Klingons to lead you to that<br>
    knowledge.</p>

  <p>74 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes -- those feelings are part of<br>
    me, but I control them. They do<br>
    not rule me.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    Yes, to fit in, the humans demand<br>
    you change the one thing you<br>
    cannot change. Yet, because you<br>
    cannot -- you do, for that too is<br>
    the mark of the warrior. You said<br>
    I mock you -- I do not. I salute<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> There is a pause as the bonding which began in the<br>
    death ritual, now continues.</p>
  <p> KONMEL<br>
    But, against whom do you test<br>
    yourself? Against what enemy do<br>
    you charge into battle?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have been in battle.</p>
  <p> Korris moves closer to Worf.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    Then you understand.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I do.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    Brother, this peace, this<br>
    alliance, is like a living death<br>
    to warriors like us.</p>
  <p> KONMEL<br>
    You are right, we lied to your<br>
    captain. We commandeered that<br>
    freighter -- left the crew behind,<br>
    and were in search of a place<br>
    where we could live our lives as<br>
    true Klingons.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You did not fight the Ferengi.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    It was one of our own cruisers<br>
    sent to bring us back.</p>

  <p>74 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    You destroyed a Klingon ship?</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    I did not want to battle our<br>
    brothers. But, we had no choice.<br>
    Our leaders sent the cruiser.<br>
    They have been corrupted by the<br>
    illusion of peace.</p>
  <p> KONMEL<br>
    They have traded our birthright<br>
    -- so they may die in their<br>
    sleep...</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    ... A peace that makes the Klingon<br>
    heart that beats in my chest<br>
    wither and die.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at his fellow warriors for a long beat.<br>
    Korris changes the mood.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Is it permitted for you to show<br>
    us around this ship?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes -- of course.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    No, sir. Not yet.</p>

  <p> Worf proudly leads Korris and Konmel through, and the<br>
    two visitors are suitably impressed.</p>
  <p> KONMEL<br>
    What magnificent battles we could<br>
    have at the helm of this ship.</p>
  <p> Worf gives him a sharp look.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Perhaps your dreams of glory no<br>
    longer fit the time. They<br>
    belong buried with the past.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    Standing here we will never know.<br>
    The answer lies out there. Our<br>
    instincts will lead us.</p>
  <p> KONMEL<br>
    Instincts that have not been<br>

    I can figure out why they look<br>
    into the dying man's eyes - but<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> K'NERA<br>
    He is a criminal. A renegade who<br>
    with two others stole that<br>
    freighter, and somehow destroyed<br>
    the Klingon cruiser sent to bring<br>
    them back. We expect the<br>

  <p> As before -- Worf and the two Klingons; Tasha and her<br>
    security team. Suddenly, the turbolift doors located<br>
    between them, OPEN and a mother and her young daughter<br>
    STEP OFF. As the little girl turns, she almost runs<br>
    into Korris. The girl FREEZES. The mother is<br>
    surprised to find the two Klingons standing there.<br>

  <p>83D BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> As Tasha watches, Korris slowly reaches down and picks<br>
    up the little girl. The mother catches her breath.<br>
    Tasha EDGES FORWARD and touches her communicator.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Bridge -- we have a hostage<br>
    situation on Deck Seventeen.</p>
  <p> Korris shoots her a glance. Then -- milking the moment<br>
    slightly -- he turns and hands the little girl to Worf,<br>
    who smiles as he takes her. Tasha looks relieved and<br>
    surprised as she touches her communicator.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Bridge, this is Lieutenant Yar<br>
    -- disregard. The situation is<br>

    (continuing)<br>
    By order of the captain, you are<br>
    confined to Security.</p>
  <p> Korris smiles and looks over at Worf, then turns and<br>
    allows the security team to LEAD him and Konmel AWAY.<br>
    Worf delivers the little girl to her grateful mother.</p>

    I thought for a minute we had a<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Oh?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Yes. It looked like Korris was<br>
    going to hold the little girl as<br>
    a hostage.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That is not our way.</p>
  <p> Worf looks down the corridor as the security team of<br>

  <p> TASHA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p>88 INT. SECURITY AREA</p>
  <p> Konmel and Korris construct a Klingon weapon. Each<br>
    takes off his belt buckle. Korris twists them<br>
    together. Then each removes the side panels from their<br>
    boots. These too, fit together and form more of the<br>
    weapon, which now begins to GLOW. Then Konmel removes<br>
    the item he took off the dead Klingon. He turns it<br>
    until it forms into a tube which he attaches to the<br>
    other pieces and this becomes the barrel. The weapon<br>
    takes shape. The bracelet which Korris takes from his<br>
    wrist becomes the muzzle. Konmel's the stock.</p>
  <p>88A ANGLE ON KORRIS</p>
  <p> He holds the very deadly looking &quot;phaser&quot; and with a<br>
    nod of his head, he indicates the forcefield.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - REV. 1/14/88 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p> ANGLE ON KONMEL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> removes what looks like a very common button from his<br>
    uniform, then leans down and carefully attaches it to<br>
    the bottom of the forcefield. The field instantly IS<br>
    NEUTRALIZED.</p>
  <p>89 INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE SECURITY AREA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The two security guards immediately realize the<br>
    forcefield is down.</p>
  <p> GUARD<br>
    (on communicator)<br>
    This is Ramos -- the forcefield<br>
    in Security Three has...</p>
  <p> He never finishes. Korris and Konmel COME BURSTING<br>
    OUT the door. Korris FIRES at one guard. A PHASER<br>
    FIGHT breaks out. Konmel and the two security guards<br>
    are killed, as Korris ESCAPES.</p>
  <p> ANOTHER ANGLE - OUTSIDE SECURITY AREA</p>
  <p> Tasha and a team of security guards ARRIVE. She touches<br>
    her communicator.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Lieutenant Yar to bridge. There<br>
    has been an escape. Two of my<br>
    security are dead. So is Konmel.<br>
    Korris is loose -- and armed.</p>
  <p>90<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    92</p>
  <p>93 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The crew REACTS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Keep me informed, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> TASHA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, visual on K'Nera.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Visual on, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - 1/13/88 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>93 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There will be a slight delay,<br>
    Captain. Korris has escaped.</p>
  <p> K'NERA<br>
    He is a trained Klingon warrior,<br>
    perhaps more than you can handle.<br>
    It is no disgrace to request our<br>
    assistance.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think we can handle the<br>
    situation.</p>
  <p>94 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Korris COMES BURSTING around the corner. Those on<br>
    duty REACT. Korris brandishes his weapon... They BACK<br>
    OFF, and he CONTINUES THROUGH -- past the Dilithium<br>
    Crystal Chamber. He PAUSES and looks around for a<br>
    position of advantage.</p>
  <p>94A INT. MAIN ENGINEERING - ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Tasha and her team ENTER cautiously.</p>
  <p>94B ANGLE ON KORRIS</p>
  <p> He's found a ladder and is climbing to the second<br>
    level.</p>
  <p>94C ANGLE ON TASHA</p>
  <p> as she sizes up the situation.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Captain. Korris is in Main<br>
    Engineering.</p>
  <p>95 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING - ANOTHER SECTION</p>
  <p> where Korris is barricaded. The phaser pointing<br>
    directly at the Di-Crystal Chamber.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - 1/13/88 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>95 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Commander Korris. This is a<br>
    futile effort. You cannot win.</p>
  <p> Korris does not respond, then:</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    I will speak only to my countryman<br>
    -- only to Worf.</p>
  <p>95A INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> REACTIONS from Picard and Worf to this demand.</p>
  <p>96 ANGLE ON TASHA</p>
  <p> as she looks around to see where Korris is.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Captain, he has a phaser aimed<br>
    directly at the Dilithium Crystal<br>
    Chamber. At that range, one blast<br>
    and...</p>
  <p>97 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Everyone's uncertain as to what to do next.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Permission to leave the bridge,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll both go.</p>
  <p> Worf and Picard LEAVE the bridge as the crew watches<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - 1/13/88 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>98 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> ESTABLISHING.</p>
  <p>99 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> as Worf and Picard APPROACH. Tasha has contained the<br>
    situation and cleared out all but her security force<br>
    who have been strategically placed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's the siutation?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    He's on the second level. Armed<br>
    with a phaser. We do not have<br>
    a clear field of fire.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How do you suggest we proceed?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Wait him out.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain. May I speak with him?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    I don't think that's a good idea.<br>
    Right now he's running on<br>
    adrenalin. Let it cool. There's<br>
    no place he can go.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He will wait only as long as he<br>
    believes it is to his advantage,<br>
    the moment it is not, he will fire<br>
    his phaser into the Dilithium<br>
    Crystal Chamber.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    That would destroy the Enterprise<br>
    and him along with it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes... he knows.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - 1/13/88 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>99 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard is pensive for a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Talk to him, Worf.</p>
  <p> Worf nods, and WALKS THROUGH Engineering toward the<br>
    Di-Crystal Chamber.</p>
  <p>99A ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Worf moves up beside the Di-Crystal Chamber, he<br>
    looks up and sees:</p>
  <p>99B ANGLE ON KORRIS</p>
  <p> He's perched on the second level. He has a clear field<br>
    of fire. Before another could reach him, he could<br>
    easily take out the Di-Crystal Chamber. He sees Worf.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    Brother -- I knew you would come.</p>
  <p>99C ANGLE ON WORF</p>
  <p> He glances over to the ladder and walks toward it.<br>
    Korris continues to talk.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    Now I... we have a chance.</p>
  <p>99D ANGLE ON KORRIS</p>
  <p> He relaxes slightly because now has has an ally.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    I could not do it alone, but I<br>
    would rather die here, than let<br>
    the traitors of Kling pick the<br>
    meat from my bones. With you it<br>
    will work.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What will work?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - 1/13/88 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>100 BACK TO SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Worf nears the top of the ladder and swings onto the<br>
    catwalk.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    I will demand Captain Picard give<br>
    us access to the Battle Bridge.<br>
    We will separate from the rest<br>
    of the ship, and together, we will<br>
    light up the galaxy. Imagine the<br>
    fear which will roll before us.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain Picard will not comply.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    He cannot -- dare not -- refuse us.<br>
    In order to save themselves, they<br>
    will give us what we demand -- then,<br>
    brother, we are free.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Put down the phaser.</p>
  <p> Korris is surprised.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    Wait. I do not believe this.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Believe it.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    I have tasted your heart. You<br>
    have been with them, but you are<br>
    still &quot;of&quot; us. Do not deny the<br>
    challenge of your destiny. Get<br>
    off your knees and soar. Open<br>
    your eyes and let the dream take<br>
    flight.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    My brother, it is you who does<br>
    not see. You are looking for<br>
    battles in the wrong place. The<br>
    test of the warrior is not without --<br>
    it is within.</p>
  <p> Worf touches his chest.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - 1/13/88 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>100 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Here we meet the challenge. It<br>
    is the weaknesses in here the<br>
    warrior must overcome.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You have talked of glory -- and<br>
    conquest -- and legends we will<br>
    write.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    Yes -- the birthright of every<br>
    Klingon.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yet in all you say, where are the<br>
    words -- duty -- honor -- loyalty.<br>
    Without which a warrior is<br>
    nothing.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    What are you saying?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Put down the phaser.</p>
  <p> Korris ignores the command -- as he continues to rail at<br>
    Worf.</p>
  <p> KORRIS<br>
    Living among these humans has<br>
    sucked the Klingon heart out of<br>
    you. You are a sham. My words<br>
    were dust upon the ground. Your<br>
    blood has no fire -- you are weak<br>
    -- like them. I don't care what<br>
    you look like -- you are no<br>
    Klingon.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Perhaps not.</p>
  <p> And without warning -- he BLASTS Korris. The phaser<br>
    is set on kill.</p>
  <p>101 ANGLE ON KORRIS</p>
  <p> as he FALLS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - 1/13/88 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>101A ANGLE ON WORF</p>
  <p> He REACTS.</p>
  <p>102 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING - PICARD, TASHA, SECURITY<br>
    TEAM</p>
  <p> Tasha and the others START TO MOVE FORWARD.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wait.</p>
  <p> The security team FREEZES.</p>
  <p>103 ANGLE ON WORF</p>
  <p> He steps over to Korris, leans down and takes the dying<br>
    Klingon's head in his hands and with his thumbs pries<br>
    open the eyes. For a long moment he stares into them.</p>
  <p>104 PICARD AND TASHA</p>
  <p> as they watch the ritual.</p>
  <p>105 ANGLE ON WORF</p>
  <p> After a beat, he leans back his head and ROARS a<br>
    warning to those who have gone before. A Klingon<br>
    warrior is coming -- beware.</p>
  <p>106 ANGLE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> OFF his REACTION.</p>
  <p>107 OMITTED</p>
  <p>108 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard and Worf EXIT the turbolift. As Picard takes<br>
    his Command Chair:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Open hailing frequencies.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hailing frequencies open.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - REV. 1/14/88 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>108 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander K'Nera, this is Captain<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> The image of the Klingon Commander COMES ON the<br>
    Viewscreen.</p>
  <p> K'NERA<br>
    Yes, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Korris and the other Klingon are<br>
    dead.</p>
  <p> K'NERA<br>
    May I speak with Lieutenant Worf?</p>
  <p> Picard motions for Worf to step forward.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, Commander.</p>
  <p> K'NERA<br>
    How did they die?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They died well.</p>
  <p> K'Nera nods.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you wish the bodies?</p>
  <p> K'NERA<br>
    They are now only empty shells -<br>
    dispose of them as you see fit.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Worf, when your tour of duty on the<br>
    Enterprise is complete -- consider<br>
    serving with us. Your training<br>
    and experience would be of benefit<br>
    to us -- and perhaps there are some<br>
    things we could teach you.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will consider it. Thank you.</p>
  <p> K'Nera nods and CLICKS OFF.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - REV. 1/15/88 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>109 ANGLE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> He REACTS with mild surprise at Worf's statement and<br>
    looks over at Tasha, who is also surprised.</p>
  <p>110 CLOSE ON WORF</p>
  <p> Worf pauses for a beat, then replaces the crewman at<br>
    a Forward Position. As he sits, Worf senses the<br>
    tension, and hears the SILENCE. He slowly turns and<br>
    looks back at them.</p>
  <p>111 FULL SHOT</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker -- and the rest wait for some explanation.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I was just being polite, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commendable, Lieutenant. Mister La<br>
    Forge, set course for Starbase<br>
    Eight-four.</p>
  <p> Geordi taps in the information.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Really... I have no desire to<br>
    leave the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> They continue to just look at him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> Worf turns back to his console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Course set.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Speed -- warp five.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Warp five.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... And Worf.</p>
  <p> Worf turns and looks at Picard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Heart Of Glory&quot; - REV. 1/15/88 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>111 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The bridge wouldn't be the same<br>
    without you.</p>
  <p> A look between Worf and the others, who are in complete<br>
    agreement.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Engage.</p>
  <p> A very satisfied Worf turns back to his console as<br>
    Geordi engages the warp drive. Picard settles back<br>
    with a smile, as do all the others.</p>
  <p>112 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
