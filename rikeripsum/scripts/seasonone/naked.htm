  <p> STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION <br>
    &quot;The Naked Now&quot; <br>
    <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> racing through space at warp speed.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 41209.2.<br>
    We are running at Warp 7 to<br>
    rendezvous with the science vessel<br>
    S. S. Tsiolkovsky...</p>
  <p>2 FULL ON WHITE DWARF (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> with the S.S. Tsiolkovsky in orbit. Then the Enterprise<br>
    appears and moves in to join the research vessel.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... which has been routinely<br>
    monitoring the collapse of a red<br>
    supergiant star into a white<br>
    dwarf. What has brought us here<br>
    is a series of strange messages<br>
    indicating something has gone<br>
    wrong aboard the research vessel.</p>
  <p>3 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> All regulars on duty -- Data at Ops, Geordi at Conn, Tasha<br>
    and Worf upstage intent on main viewer which shows the<br>
    Enterprise moving in parallel with the research vessel.<br>
    First, a STATIC GARBLE, then a WOMAN'S VOICE over the<br>
    audio channel, low and insinuating. INDISTINCT VOICES,<br>
    LAUGHTER, IN B.G. indicate the SOUNDS OF A NOISY PARTY.</p>
  <p> WOMAN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Well, hello Enterprise.<br>
    Welcome... I hope you have a lot<br>
    of pretty boys on board... because<br>
    I'm willing... and waiting...</p>
  <p> They wait for more, then Picard nods toward Data.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 6/30/87 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (touches com panel)<br>
    S.S. Tsiolkovsky, repeat your<br>
    message.</p>
  <p> WOMAN'S COM VOICE<br>
    (laughter, then)<br>
    In fact... we're going to have a<br>
    real blowout here... Thought that<br>
    would interest you. Waiting!</p>
  <p> She LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY. There is MORE LAUGHTER FROM<br>
    THE OTHERS, some cries of &quot;DO IT! GO AHEAD!&quot; in b.g.<br>
    of the transmission, an EXPLOSIVE SOUND -- and then<br>
    silence. After a beat:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain... what we just heard is,<br>
    well...impossible.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Report.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    I believe that last sound we heard<br>
    was an emergency hatch being<br>
    blown.</p>
  <p> The subspace channel is still open -- all we HEAR is<br>
    the HISS OF EMPTY AIR.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you certain... yes, of course<br>
    you are.</p>
  <p> Riker comes to his feet fast, gets a nod from Picard,<br>
    motions for Data, Geordi and Tasha to follow him to the<br>
    turbolift.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sensor scan now reveals no life<br>
    signs aboard, Captain.</p>
  <p>4 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - ANGLE ON AWAY TEAM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The away team consists of RIKER, GEORDI, DATA, TASHA,<br>
    and a SECURITY GUARD. Data and Geordi have tricorders;<br>
    Tasha has the large phaser.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Put us on their bridge, Chief.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 6/30/87 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER CHIEF<br>
    Life support systems are not<br>
    functioning in that area, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker nods to the TRANSPORTER CHIEF at the console.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then put us in the main corridor.<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p> The Transporter Chief works his console controls deftly.<br>
    As the TRANSPORTER EFFECT AND SOUNDS BEGIN AND BUILD:</p>
  <p>5 INT. TSIOLKOVSKY MAIN CORRIDOR - ON AWAY TEAM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The TRANSPORTER EFFECT COMES IN, FADES DOWN, leaving<br>
    the away team materialized. The ship is very quiet --<br>
    a low HUM of working equipment, but without the murmur<br>
    of living beings.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Cover the ship as planned. Move<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi put tricorders on &quot;record&quot; and all move<br>
    out.</p>
  <p>6 INT. SECOND CORRIDOR - ON RIKER AND DATA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> This corridor shows signs of phaser char marks on the<br>
    walls. There is litter on the deck -- food, a wine<br>
    bottle, discarded clothes. Data records the scene with<br>
    his tricorder, as:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Indications of what humans would<br>
    call... a &quot;wild party?&quot;</p>
  <p> Riker has moved quickly to a door at the end of the<br>
    corridor. It is shut, but there is a small viewscreen<br>
    set in the wall beside it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Their bridge. If this thing<br>
    works, be sure to record ---</p>
  <p> He activates the viewscreen, takes a look, and GROANS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 6/26/87 4.</p>
  <p>7 CLOSE SHOT - SMALL VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Narrow view of a small bridge (SET FRAGMENT), mostly<br>
    consoles, maybe a command chair. And beyond these, the<br>
    emergency hatch set in the bulkhead -- the hatch is<br>
    gone, and the cold glitter of a starfield winks beyond<br>
    it. (SET DRESSING NOTE: There should be no loose<br>
    objects visible, only items that are firmly anchored<br>
    to deck or bulkhead. Anything loose would have been<br>
    swept into space when the air rushed out into the<br>
    vacuum.)</p>
  <p>8 WIDER SHOT - RIKER AND DATA</p>
  <p> Riker steps aside, gesturing to Data to record the scene<br>
    on the viewer as:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You were right. Somebody blew<br>
    the hatch and they were all sucked<br>
    out into space..</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Correction, sir, blown out.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A common mistake, sir...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (emphasis)<br>
    I know! Thank you, Data.</p>
  <p> TASHA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Commander Riker, it's Lieutenant<br>
    Yar, location Engineering. Ten<br>
    people here, sir, all frozen.<br>
    No vital signs.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (touches communicator)<br>
    Frozen how?</p>
  <p> TASHA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Looks to me like someone was<br>
    &quot;playing&quot; with the environmental<br>
    controls, sir. Just let all the<br>
    heat bleed away into space.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    That's ridiculous!</p>
  <p> TASHA'S COM VOICE<br>
    That's what I say, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 6/26/87 5.</p>
  <p>9 INT. PERSONNEL QUARTERS - ANGLE ON ENTRY DOOR</p>
  <p> as it opens heavily and causes a slight AIR HISSING.<br>
    Geordi ENTERS from the corridor, reacts to the AIR<br>
    HISSING, hits a wall control on the inside. His<br>
    expression changes to one of dismay as he looks around.</p>
  <p>10 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> CAMERA ANGLE REVEALS a room partially covered with<br>
    frost. We glimpse several male and female bodies,<br>
    scantily clad or (implied) nude, possibly a couple<br>
    entwined. All are frozen and dead. Bits of frost-covered<br>
    lingerie and other intimate clothing are<br>
    scattered around. Geordi touches his insignia.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sir, Lieutenant La Forge in the<br>
    crew quarters. Something in here.</p>
  <p>11 BACK TO GEORDI</p>
  <p> as he HEARS A SOUND, the BUMP BUMP of a door bumping<br>
    against the jamb. Geordi hurries across the small room<br>
    toward the adjoining bathroom.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Hello!</p>
  <p>12 INT. BATHROOM - ANGLE ON GEORDI</p>
  <p> Nothing inside, Geordi decides to check the closed<br>
    shower stall, yanks the door open -- and a frozen<br>
    WOMAN'S BODY, fully clothed, falls out into his arms.<br>
    Although startled, Geordi has the presence of mind to<br>
    catch the ice-covered corpse and lower it to the floor.</p>
  <p>13 CLOSER ON GEORDI</p>
  <p> Examining the frozen woman who had once been attractive,<br>
    shakes his head in pity. He rests one hand on the wet<br>
    side wall of the shower to brace himself as he prepares<br>
    to stand upright again.</p>
  <p>14 VERY CLOSE ON GEORDI'S HAND AND &quot;DROPS&quot; (INSERT))</p>
  <p> Several drops of &quot;water&quot; on the icy shower wall where<br>
    Geordi's hand rests coalesce and move onto his<br>
    hand (per Justman effect).</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 6/26/87 6.</p>
  <p>15 INT. TSIOLKOVSKY MAIN CORRIDOR - EMPHASIZING RIKER</p>
  <p> as he uses his communicator.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Riker to Captain, I have a report<br>
    for you.</p>
  <p>16 INT. ENTERPRISE MAIN BRIDGE - CLOSE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> Worf at Ops (port) and crewman at Conn (starboard).</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (tabs com control)<br>
    Picard here.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    They're all dead, sir. Some were<br>
    apparently blown out the emergency<br>
    hatches.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There were eighty people on that<br>
    ship, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yes sir. As I said, all dead.</p>
  <p> Picard looks incredulous.<br>
    FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 6/26/87 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>17 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND TSIOLKOVSKY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Tsiolkovsky still drifts in space. The Enterprise<br>
    is nearby. Over this:</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental. We<br>
    are downloading the research<br>
    information gathered on the<br>
    collapsing...</p>
  <p>18 CLOSE ANGLE ON DWARF STAR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> looking somehow strange, unstable, although we'd see<br>
    no surface movement at this range.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... star nearby. I am concerned<br>
    at being in such close orbit, but<br>
    the Tsiolkovsky's research<br>
    records...</p>
  <p>19 INT. ENTERPRISE MEDICAL CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> with Picard striding toward Dr. Crusher's office.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... will no doubt predict the time<br>
    of the star's final collapse.</p>
  <p>20 INT. CRUSHER'S OFFICE - ON BEVERLY, PICARD AND TROI</p>
  <p> Beverly is examining information as it comes up on a<br>
    desktop viewer. (NOTE: We see only the back of the<br>
    viewer and the flicker of light on her face as the<br>
    information changes.) Troi is there too, also watching<br>
    the screen.</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS, strides over to examine the viewing<br>
    screen too.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can't find anything unusual in<br>
    any of the tricorder readings<br>
    they've sent over, Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 6/26/87 8.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard straightens up, and Beverly turns around to look<br>
    at him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Give me a theory, Doctor.<br>
    Anything!</p>
  <p> Beverly's silence is eloquent. She shakes her head,<br>
    her face has a worried look.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (turning; continuing)<br>
    Troi? Did you feel anything from<br>
    over there?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Perhaps some residual<br>
    confusion... and exhilaration, too.<br>
    But I'm not too certain of that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Madness? Mass hysteria?<br>
    Delusion?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Any or all, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right. Let's bring the away<br>
    team back. Set the transporter<br>
    for maximum decontamination. And<br>
    then full examinations and<br>
    observation when they're here.</p>
  <p> He turns and heads for the door.</p>
  <p>21 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND TSIOLKOVSKY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as before.</p>
  <p>22 INT. ENTERPRISE SICKBAY - BEVERLY, RIKER, GEORDI,<br>
    DATA</p>
  <p> Data is just getting up from one of the hospital beds<br>
    as:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If you were any more perfect,<br>
    Data, I'd write you up in a<br>
    Starfleet medical textbook.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 6/26/87 9.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am already listed in several<br>
    biomechanical texts, Doctor.</p>
  <p> Beverly doesn't quite yet know how to take Data. Riker<br>
    does, and grins.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes... of course.<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    You're next, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> Data LEAVES. Geordi obligingly lies down on the<br>
    hospital bed, and Beverly starts to monitor him with<br>
    a small instrument.</p>
  <p>23 ANGLE ON MEDICAL VIEWSCREEN</p>
  <p> The readings come on -- nothing radical anywhere.</p>
  <p>24 WIDER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Beverly looks up at the o.s. viewscreen, then:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Normal -- all across.<br>
    Except... why are you perspiring?</p>
  <p> Geordi appears to have a fine sheen of perspiration on<br>
    his face.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I suppose because you have it too<br>
    hot in here. What else would it<br>
    be?</p>
  <p> Both Beverly and Riker have reacted to this un-Geordi<br>
    reply.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That doesn't... sound exactly like<br>
    you, Geordi.</p>
  <p> Geordi looks up, then replies pleasantly, grinning.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe it wasn't.<br>
    (indicates Beverly)<br>
    Maybe she threw her voice.</p>
  <p> He means it as a joke but no one is amused.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 6/30/87 10.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Joke.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Of course. But I would like to<br>
    run another test or two on you,<br>
    Lieutenant.</p>
  <p>25 INT. MAIN BRIDGE AND CRUSHER'S OFFICE (INTERCUTS)</p>
  <p> as Picard turns to his panel.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Sickbay to Bridge...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard here. Go ahead, Doctor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    I'm confining Lieutenant La Forge<br>
    to Sickbay until further notice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do we have a problem, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    I don't know yet.</p>
  <p>26 INT. ENTERPRISE MAIN BRIDGE - FULL SHOT</p>
  <p> as Riker ENTERS from a turbolift and crosses toward<br>
    Data, who is working at one of the science stations at<br>
    the rear of the Bridge. All other Bridge Personnel are<br>
    in place -- Picard, Tasha, Worf at Ops, Crewman at<br>
    Conn.</p>
  <p>27 CLOSER TWO SHOT - RIKER AND DATA</p>
  <p> Data looks up as Riker approaches him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, I need help in locating some<br>
    library-computer information.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Specifics, sir?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 6/30/87 10A.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> He is resting on a hospital bed. Beverly finishes<br>
    working over him with a medical instrument, checks a<br>
    reading on it, moves toward her office. (NOTE: At no<br>

  <p>30 INT. SICKBAY - ON GEORDI</p>
  <p> He sits up, takes off his communicator and lays it to<br>
    one side. Then he gets to his feet, and quietly EXITS<br>
    the Sickbay. A moment, then Beverly comes back IN --<br>
    stares at the empty bed, snatches up Geordi's<br>
    communicator and runs for the door.</p>

  <p>34 INT. CRUSHER'S QUARTERS - ANGLE ON WESLEY AND<br>
    GEORDI</p>
  <p> The boy is in the living space, near a table littered<br>
    with delicate futuristic tools.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 7/1/87 13.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He has an intricately shaped tube attached to a miniature<br>
    control device. It is a MINIATURE TRACTOR BEAM (OPTICAL).<br>
    As Geordi watches, Wesley is using the device to maneuver a<br>
    chair in the air.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's a model of the same kind of<br>
    tractor beam our ship uses... with<br>
    some ideas of my own added.</p>
  <p> He hoists the chair higher, floats it sideways, lets<br>
    it settle to the deck. Geordi is fascinated.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So that's your science project.<br>
    Wes, you are something!</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Meanwhile, the captain won't let<br>
    me visit the bridge.</p>
  <p> Wesley goes to the littered table, pulls out a<br>
    transparent cube, slides it into a slot on a small flat<br>
    (portable) machine.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    So I use this to imagine I'm<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> Wesley touches a control and a light goes on at the tiny<br>
    machine.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S VOICE<br>
    Take the helm, Mister Crusher.<br>
    Set a course for thirty-seven mark<br>
    one hundred eighty. Warp six.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (indicates)<br>
    That's the captain's voice.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Pieced together from words he's<br>
    used on the intercom.<br>
    (indicates)<br>
    I can pretend he's ordering me<br>
    to take the Enterprise anywhere.<br>
    And listen to this...</p>
  <p> Wesley touches another control.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 6/30/87 14.</p>

  <p> PICARD'S VOICE<br>
    Chief Engineer, report to the<br>
    Bridge. Commander Riker, report<br>
    to the Bridge. Doctor Crusher,<br>
    report to the Bridge.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What d'you think?</p>
  <p> Geordi puts a friendly arm about the boy's shoulder.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I think the captain's lucky you're<br>
    on his side.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But he still won't let me on the<br>
    bridge. And there's nothing there<br>
    I don't understand.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Wish I understood myself that<br>
    well.</p>
  <p> Wesley turns at the &quot;down&quot; note in Geordi's voice.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You okay?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No. Suddenly I seem to be burning<br>
    up inside.</p>
  <p> Geordi stands, moves for the door.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    Wow it's hot in here.</p>

  <p> She ENTERS SCENE from behind him, looking for a reaction<br>
    from him.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>

    Medical's been worried about you.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    Help me.</p>
  <p> Tasha studies him a beat. He seems so sad, so lonely.<br>
    Then:</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Lieutenant Yar in the Observation<br>
    Lounge. Send a team here now.</p>
  <p> After a beat, Geordi swings around to look at her, pain<br>
    and longing chasing across his face.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Tasha... I said &quot;help me.&quot; Help<br>
    me not to give in to the wild<br>
    things coming into my mind...</p>
  <p> Tasha is moved, tries to fight it off.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Geordi -- my job is security...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Please.</p>
  <p> Tasha folds him into arms.</p>

    Yes, helping is more important.<br>

  <p>37 BACK TO SHOT</p>
  <p> A Security Guard hurries into the room, stops as Tasha<br>
    motions him to a halt.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Help me to see like you do.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 6/26/87 16.</p>

    But you already see better than<br>
    I can.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I see more. But more isn't<br>
    better!</p>
  <p> He tears off the prosthesis, exposing eyes that have<br>
    flat gray irises with no pupil, incapable of expression.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Geordi...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I want to see in shallow, dim,<br>
    beautiful human ways.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    We'll talk about it, Geordi.<br>
    (takes his arm)<br>
    I'm going to take you to Sickbay<br>
    now. All right?</p>
  <p> He bobs his head, willing to be assisted. As she leads<br>
    him away:</p>

  <p> The dwarf star in view too.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V. O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental. I<br>
    am concerned that away team member<br>
    Lieutenant La Forge has been taken<br>
    to Sickbay. The report: &quot;unusual<br>
    behavior.&quot;</p>
  <p>39 INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE ON BEVERLY, GEORDI, TROI</p>
  <p> Geordi is lying on a hospital bed still struggling to<br>
    control his emotions, while Beverly works her medical<br>
    instruments over him, glancing up now and then at the<br>
    o.s. viewscreen to check the results. Troi is assisting<br>
    the monitoring.</p>
  <p>40 INT. CRUSHER'S OFFICE - ON TASHA AND PICARD</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    ... and then we got him down to<br>
    sickbay so Dr. Crusher could<br>
    examine him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He wasn't violent?</p>
  <p> She glances over her shoulder back toward the treatment<br>
    room.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    No, sir. He was very upset... he<br>
    kept talking about wanting normal<br>
    eyes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you, Lieutenant. I'll be<br>
    in Sickbay.</p>
  <p> Picard HURRIES OUT immediately. It's clear he has much<br>
    on his mind. Tasha moves to EXIT, then pauses.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 6/26/87 18.</p>
  <p>41 CLOSE ON TASHA</p>
  <p> wiping a hand over her lightly perspiring brow. As she<br>
    EXITS, it is clear she feels strange somehow.</p>
  <p>42 INT. SICKBAY - ON BEVERLY, GEORDI, TROI, PICARD</p>
  <p> Beverly administers a hypospray to Geordi, which finally<br>
    begins to calm his emotional state. As Picard joins<br>
    them, Beverly turns and indicates her medical<br>
    viewscreen.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    According to our medical readouts,<br>
    there's still nothing wrong with<br>
    him. He looks like he's running<br>
    a temperature but every instrument<br>
    we have says he's not.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor, every person on that ship<br>
    over there died. Is there any<br>
    chance that whatever did it is<br>
    loose on my ship?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If you mean a disease, sir, I'd<br>
    say there's no chance of it. We<br>
    used full decontamination, we<br>
    examined each team member<br>
    carefully...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    The entire crew over there somehow<br>
    managed to kill themselves,<br>
    Doctor. If it wasn't a disease,<br>
    what else could have made them<br>
    do that?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The obvious alternatives would<br>
    be in areas of insanity, severe<br>
    emotional upset...<br>
    (stops short; to Troi)<br>
    Troi, do you feel anything unusual<br>
    in the lieutenant here?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Security reported he was longing<br>
    for normal eyesight. A rather<br>
    sudden yearning for that.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 6/26/87 19.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Since his records show no previous<br>
    mention of that, the fact that it's<br>
    happened now could be important.</p>
  <p> Troi centers her attention on Geordi, mentally probing.<br>
    Then:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But all I feel from him is<br>
    confusion. If I didn't know<br>
    better, I'd say he was<br>
    intoxicated.</p>
  <p> The Captain throws a quick look toward Beverly who<br>
    shakes her head firmly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Our tests would have shown that.<br>
    Also any signs of drugs,<br>
    hallucinogens or other<br>
    contaminants.</p>
  <p>43 INT. ENTERPRISE MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON RIKER AND DATA</p>
  <p> still at the science station, Data's fingers flying over<br>
    tabs on the console. He looks at the viewscreen, shakes<br>
    his head. Worf and Crewman as before.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Can you provide more information,<br>
    sir? Seeking an instance of<br>
    someone showering with their<br>
    clothing on is...is...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I know... like looking for a needle<br>
    in a haystack.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    Why should anyone wish to expend<br>
    their time in such a search?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Correction, Data, I should have<br>
    said proverbial needle in a<br>
    haystack.</p>

    allusion, or tribal memories,<br>
    or...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    That's it! Historical! I<br>
    remember now that I was reading<br>

  <p> Troi's quarters are tastefully decorated, including a<br>
    scattering of art objects that may be Betazoid in origin<br>
    -- perhaps a wall hanging, a unique piece of pottery<br>
    or statuette, or paintings. At the moment, there are<br>
    also a number of lovely dresses and gowns draped over<br>
    the furniture. Troi ENTERS and stops inside the door,<br>
    staring.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

  <p>47 INCLUDING TASHA</p>
  <p> She is somewhat agitated and has a light sheen of<br>
    perspiration as she holds one of Troi's gowns against<br>
    her, judging it for color. The size, of course, would<br>
    be all wrong for her.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Not for you. Tasha, I feel you're<br>

    to Tasha, and she is moving with the sexiest walk<br>
    imaginable -- quite unlike her usual straightforward<br>
    stride. Her whole expression has acquired a sexy pout.<br>
    She approaches an intersection where several crewpersons<br>

    and I'll...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Because ship captains control<br>
    their own vessels, young man!</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But, sir, you don't do it<br>
    yourself. You give the orders,<br>
    someone else does it. What's<br>
    wrong with giving me the orders<br>
    to do it?</p>
  <p> Worf and Conn have exchanged looks during this although<br>
    Conn has begun to perspire and appears uncomfortable.<br>
    Worf sees something unusual on his console, interrupts<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, getting unusual readings<br>
    now from the dwarf star... !</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stand by a moment on that.<br>
    (toward main viewer)<br>
    Wesley... !<br>
    (softens it)<br>
    Wes... are you aware that you're<br>
    acting strangely... that a kind<br>
    of &quot;infection&quot; was brought back<br>
    from the Tsiolkovsky that acts<br>
    like intoxication?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (considers it)<br>
    Are you saying that's why I feel<br>
    so... so &quot;hot,&quot; so strange?</p>
  <p> Picard wants to shout back &quot;of freakin' course!&quot; but he<br>
    controls himself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's a very adult bit of<br>
    reasoning, Wes...</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Are you saying I'm &quot;drunk?&quot; I<br>
    feel strange but also good.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Because...<br>
    (corrects his tone of<br>
    voice)<br>
    Because you've lost the capacity<br>
    for self-judgment. Alcohol does<br>
    that but this contaminant we've<br>
    brought back does it even more<br>
    so.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What would you do if you got your<br>
    ship back?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's very important I do because<br>
    we must immediately put a tractor<br>
    beam on the Tsiolkovsky, then tow<br>
    it out of...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Tractor beams are my specialty,<br>
    Skipper! I'll contact you when<br>
    that's done; Wesley out!</p>

    with a view of the dwarf star. It is in the midst of a<br>
    gigantic FLARE.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wes!</p>
  <p> Conn gets up from his position now, weaves toward the<br>
    turbolift.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Conn, where are you headed?</p>
  <p> No answer. Conn will EXIT by turbolift as:</p>

    SHIMODA</p>
  <p> Wesley is working some controls on one of the consoles,<br>
    singing:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Lock on, Tsiolkovsky, lock<br>
    on... lock on, Tsiolkovsky, lock<br>
    on...</p>
  <p> Behind him, Shimoda still sits on the floor, playing<br>
    something like &quot;jacks&quot; with the isolinear optical chips<br>
    from the computer, scooping up the chips in orderly<br>
    groups -- 1, 2, 3, etc.</p>
  <p>89 INT. ENGINEERING - ON MACDOUGAL AND RIKER</p>
  <p> They work together at the console opposite the entrance<br>
    to Engineer's Office, probing deep into the guts of the<br>
    console. A small array of tools lies between them, which<br>
    they share.</p>
  <p> MACDOUGAL<br>
    You got the logic probe?<br>
    (he hands it to her)<br>
    Thanks.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where's the sonic driver?</p>
  <p> She grunts and gestures at the spread of tools. Riker<br>
    looks, finds it, dives into the console again. MacDougal<br>
    works quickly, steps back.</p>
  <p> MACDOUGAL<br>
    There. Let's see if this'll cut<br>
    out his tractor beam power.</p>
  <p> She reaches inside the console and switches something.<br>
    She and Riker both turn to look behind them.</p>
  <p>90 ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW INTO ENGINEER'S OFFICE<br>

    (waits; then)<br>
    Wesley Crusher, come in!</p>
  <p> One of the turbolift doors HISSES OPEN and Data ENTERS<br>
    the Bridge. Picard whirls to him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Data! At least you're<br>
    functioning.. !</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Fully, Captain, fully.</p>
  <p> But it obvious from the look on his face and his weaving<br>
    movements that Data is not at all himself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, intoxication is a human<br>
    condition. Your mind is<br>
    different, it's not the same...</p>

    I'm busy, Doctor. Impossible.</p>
  <p> But Beverly EXITS Bridge into Ready Room. Picard<br>

    Damn!</p>
  <p>95A INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS, finds Beverly waiting. She has a slight<br>
    smile on her face.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I believe I'm infected myself.</p>
  <p> Beverly steps toward Picard, suddenly GIGGLES. It's the<br>
    same high pitched sound we've heard from some others.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you know what the infection<br>
    is? Hurry!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 6/30/87 45.</p>
  <p>95A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard realizes that Beverly is beginning to smile at<br>
    him a bit sexily. She tries to stop doing so. All this<br>
    is complicated for her by the fact she has begun lately<br>
    to find this man increasingly attractive.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Sorry.<br>
    (wipes off smile)<br>
    It is definitely like alcohol<br>
    intoxication, the same lack of<br>
    good judgment...<br>
    (smiling sexily again)<br>
    For example right now, I find you,<br>
    well, extremely...extremely...<br>
    (stops)<br>
    Of course we haven't time for that<br>
    sort of thing...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What sort of thing?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (eyeing his body)<br>
    Oh God would I love to show you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor, there must be a cure!<br>
    Some formula, similar to the old<br>
    one...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    Dammit... dammit, dammit, my dear<br>
    captain. You owe me something.<br>
    You do realize that, don't you?<br>
    I'm a woman; I haven't the comfort<br>
    of a husband, a man...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not now, Doctor, please...</p>
  <p> Then he's alarmed to find himself GIGGLING, wiping<br>
    moisture from his forehead.</p>
  <p>96 ANGLE EMPHASIZING WORF</p>
  <p> On the Bridge, Ready Room door in b.g. He turns<br>
    as Picard and Beverly EMERGE from the Ready Room.<br>
    Beverly ENTERS the nearby Turbolift, turns and waves<br>
    &quot;bye-bye.&quot; Picard fights the urge to giggle, waves<br>
    back. The doors close. Picard, very irritated at<br>
    self, regains control. Worf presses his intercom.</p>

  <p> Picard very concerned at what he is seeing; Beverly<br>
    reacting to his concern; even the bemused Data watching<br>
    it with some interest. Beverly turns, CROSSES toward<br>
    the turbolift where she will EXIT. As Riker ENTERS.<br>
    Meanwhile:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What we're seeing, sir, is a huge<br>

    Worf, you know what to do. Take<br>

  <p> Worf works controls, gets nothing, leaps over to the<br>

  <p>121 WIDER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Wesley reacts at the nearness now of the star material.<br>
    Then looks at his tractor device.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    If this were a hundred times more<br>
    powerful than it is...</p>
  <p>122 INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE ON GEORDI</p>
  <p> as Beverly administers the hypo to Geordi with Picard<br>
    looking on.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I made this a broader based<br>
    remedy... I hope. But it's still<br>
    close to the formula from the old<br>
    Enterprise's records...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Decades ago, light years away...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But almost exactly the same<br>
    conditions as here.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What was in that, Doctor? My<br>
    head's beginning to clear...</p>
  <p> Both react to the sight of Geordi beginning to sit up<br>
    alertly. Beverly whirls, injecting Picard... then<br>
    herself. She presses the hypo on him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Take this to Engineering. I'll<br>
    make up more hypos for the others.</p>
  <p>123 INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE</p>
  <p> as before but with Riker gloomy now. Data and Wesley<br>
    continuing work. But Wesley is struck with an idea,<br>
    leaps to the Engineering Room control board.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 6/26/87 55.</p>
  <p>123 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Eyes it, then:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Why not try it with the real<br>
    thing?!<br>
    (to MacDougal)<br>
    Why not reverse fields on this,<br>
    Ma'am? If we only need an extra<br>
    minute...</p>
  <p> MACDOUGAL<br>
    It would take weeks of laying out<br>
    new circuits...</p>
  <p>124 EMPHASIZING WESLEY</p>
  <p> studying the Engineering Room board.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But why not just see it in your<br>
    head?<br>
    (thinks, presses<br>
    switches)<br>
    Come off the main lead, split at<br>
    the force activator,<br>
    then...then...<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    If I could just think straight<br>
    about this...</p>
  <p>125 WIDER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Picard bursts in, presses his hypo against MacDougal,<br>
    then Riker, then another person, etc.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We didn't make it, Captain. If<br>
    we had just a minute or so more...</p>
  <p>126 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE, TSIOLKOVSKY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> with the star material looming large as it rushes down<br>
    upon them.</p>
  <p>127 INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - ON WESLEY</p>
  <p> His fingers begin to dance on the panel.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 7/2/87 56.</p>
  <p>127 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, then reversing power leads,<br>
    back through the force<br>
    activator... repulser beam hard<br>
    against the Tsiolkovsky...</p>
  <p>128 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE, TSIOLKOVSKY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Tsiolkovsky now begins drifting to one side,<br>
    beginning to spin clear with the Enterprise moving away<br>
    from it.</p>
  <p>129 INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> Riker eyes the viewer in surprise.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're pushing away!</p>
  <p> Data lifts his hands from the command computer board.<br>
    The isolinear optical chips GLOW on the board.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing; into<br>
    communicator)<br>
    Bridge, engage engines!</p>
  <p>130 EXT. SPACE - TSIOLKOVSKY AND MASS OF MATERIAL<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The mass of material crashes into the Tsiolkovsky. Her<br>
    warp and impulse engines EXPLODE SIMULTANEOUSLY on<br>
    impact in a mighty BLAZE OF LIGHT. But Enterprise is<br>
    accelerating out of trouble.</p>
  <p>131 INT. ENTERPRISE MAIN BRIDGE - FULL SHOT</p>
  <p> Geordi at Conn now. Relief. Beverly is there still<br>
    administering hypo injections. The red alarm lights<br>
    have stopped.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sir, something seemed to move us<br>
    aside at the last minute.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (into his com)<br>
    Do we owe our thanks to Commander<br>
    Data, sir?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 7/2/87 57.</p>
  <p>131 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yes. And... Wesley may have given<br>
    us a few seconds, too.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Did he say Wesley? The boy?</p>
  <p> Beverly nods with a pleased look.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He said Wesley.</p>
  <p>132 INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE</p>
  <p> Picard sees Riker smiling at him. He scowls, begins<br>
    to EXIT.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It is only fair to mention Wesley<br>
    in a log entry, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (stops; nods)<br>
    Fair is fair. And let's credit<br>
    his science teacher, too.</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS; Riker follows him.</p>
  <p>133<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    134</p>
  <p>135 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - PANNING</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker and Data ENTER from the Turbolift and<br>
    move toward their positions. Worf at Ops and Geordi<br>
    at Conn positions turn with pleased expressions.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Congratulations, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    To many people.</p>
  <p> During which Troi and Tasha also ENTER from Turbolift<br>
    now, move to their positions. Tasha is back to normal,<br>
    wearing her regular duty uniform, hair and makeup as<br>
    stringent as usual. Data sees, nods.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Naked Now&quot; - REV. 7/2/87 58.</p>
  <p>135 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data starts to turn away but Tasha has colored, turns<br>
    toward him.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Data! I'm only going to tell<br>
    you this just once... It never<br>
    happened.</p>
  <p> Data gives her a very puzzled look, goes to position<br>
    still puzzling over it.</p>
  <p>136 OMITTED</p>
  <p>137 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD</p>
  <p> as he sits in his position, looks around the Bridge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I put it to all of you we may end<br>
    up with a fine crew... if we keep<br>
    working at it.<br>
    (nods for emphasis;<br>
    then)<br>
    So let's get to our next job,<br>
    Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir. Helm, stand by for warp<br>
    three. Heading two-hundred<br>
    ninety-four mark thirty-seven.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Warp three, two-hundred<br>
    ninety-four mark thirty-seven,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Engage!</p>
  <p>138 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE</p>
  <p> Accelerating into WARP SPEED.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
