  TEASER </p>
<p align="center"> FADE IN:</p>
<p align="center">1 EXT. SPACE - USS ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> The great ship orbits a blue-green planet softly cloaked<br>
  in a swirl of cloud cover.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
  Captain's log, stardate 41249.3.<br>
  We have orbited the two major<br>
  planets of the Beta Renner system<br>
  taking aboard delegates from<br>
  those two worlds. Since achieving<br>
  space flight, their major life<br>
  forms, the Anticans and the<br>
  Selay...</p>
<p align="center">2 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM 4 - ANGLE ON PICARD</p>
<p align="center"> in full dress uniform, waiting impatiently near the<br>
  platform. O.S. TRANSPORTER SOUND IS BUILDING.</p>
<p align="center">3 ANGLE ON TRANSPORTER</p>
<p align="center"> as FIVE FIGURES begin to form in the sparkling<br>
  TRANSPORTER EFFECT. As they solidify, they are revealed<br>
  as FIVE ALIENS (Selay). The Chief Delegate is SSESTAR.<br>
  All Selay are tall and two axhandles across the<br>
  shoulders. Their reptilian heads are sinister -- sleek<br>
  scaled skin, lipless mouths, and beady eyes. The<br>
  markings on their heads are cobra-like, and folds of<br>
  skin at the neck imply a cobra hood.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
  (continuing)<br>
  ... have become deadly enemies.<br>
  But both have also applied for<br>
  admission into our Federation.<br>
  We are to deliver these<br>
  delegates to this sector's neutral<br>
  Conference Planet called<br>
  &quot;Parliament&quot; in the hope their<br>
  dispute can be resolved.</p>
<p align="center"> STAR TREK: &quot;Lonely Among Us&quot; - 8/21/87 - TEASER 2.</p>
<p align="center">3 CONTINUED</p>
<p align="center"> Picard gestures the Selay off the platform with a<br>
  somewhat strained smile.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  I am Captain Picard. We hope<br>
  to make this journey pleasant<br>
  and comfortable. Arranging<br>
  that will be my first officer,<br>
  Commander Riker.</p>
<p align="center">4 REVERSE ANGLE - ON RIKER AND TASHA</p>
<p align="center"> also in dress uniform, waiting near the Transporter<br>
  control console. TASHA concentrates on the Selay<br>
  delegates as RIKER steps forward formally.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Welcome aboard. If you'll follow<br>
  me...<br>
  (starts MOVING OFF)<br>
  ... I'll show you the<br>
  accommodations we've...</p>
<p align="center">5 WIDER ANGLE</p>
<p align="center"> The Selay leader, Ssestar, interrupts:</p>
<p align="center"> SSESTAR<br>
  We can already smell the Anticans.<br>
  They were taken aboard first?</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Only because their world was the<br>
  first on our heading to<br>
  Parliament.</p>
<p align="center"> SSESTAR<br>
  Will our quarters be near the<br>
  Anticans?</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  About one hundred meters apart.<br>
  Is that all right?</p>
<p align="center"> SSESTAR<br>
  No. Unsatisfactory.</p>
<p align="center"> Picard starts to frown, but Riker nods to the captain<br>
  -- he'll handle it.</p>
<p align="center"> STAR TREK: &quot;Lonely Among Us&quot; - 8/21/87 - TEASER 3.</p>
<p align="center">5 CONTINUED</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  I believe we can accommodate their<br>
  wishes, Captain.<br>
  (to Ssestar)<br>
  We'll rearrange suite assignments.<br>
  If you'll follow me?</p>
<p align="center"> Ssestar hesitates, then grunts an assent and motions<br>
  his people to follow as he moves toward the door.</p>
<p align="center"> SSESTAR<br>
  And we must be upwind from the<br>
  Anticans.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Of course, sir...</p>
<p align="center"> The delegation EXITS with Riker. As they leave and the<br>
  DOORS CLOSE:</p>
<p align="center"> TASHA<br>
  Neither seem very promising<br>
  Federation candidates.</p>
<p align="center"> Picard nods, begins EXITING with Tasha.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Even Parliament's peacemakers may<br>
  find this case difficult.</p>
<p align="center">6 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> The ship moves majestically out of orbit, goes into the<br>
  WARP SPEED EFFECT.</p>
<p align="center">7 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE</p>
<p align="center"> All the regular crew at their stations, except for<br>
  Geordi and Worf, who are absent. A replacement CONN<br>
  OFFICER is at that panel, next to DATA at Ops.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (to Riker)<br>
  Do you understand the basis of<br>
  all that nonsense between them?</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  No sir. I didn't understand that<br>
  kind of hostility even when I<br>
  studied Earth history.</p>
<p align="center"> STAR TREK: &quot;Lonely Among Us&quot; - 8/21/87 - TEASER 4.</p>
<p align="center">7 CONTINUED</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Oh? Well, yes, but these life<br>
  forms feel such passionate hatred<br>
  over differences in customs, God<br>
  concepts, and even strangely enough,<br>
  economic systems...</p>
<p align="center">8 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
<p align="center"> Data has frowned at something on his panel, looks around<br>
  at Picard.</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  Sir, my sensors are picking up<br>
  an unusual energy object ahead.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  On screen.</p>
<p align="center"> Data punches up the command.</p>
<p align="center">9 ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> A strange ENERGY PATTERN moving at warp speed.</p>
<p align="center"> TASHA<br>
  Confirmed, sir. My sensors read<br>
  nothing solid but considerable<br>
  energy in...<br>
  (puzzles over reading)<br>
  ... in changing patterns.</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  Traveling at warp speed, too.<br>
  Intriguing.<br>
  (tabs panel, looks up)<br>
  I can find no match with anything<br>
  in our records, sir.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (eyes viewer; then)<br>
  Change course for a close sensor<br>
  pass... we'll then increase warp<br>
  speed to reach Parliament on<br>
  schedule.</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  Aye, sir.</p>
<p align="center"> STAR TREK: &quot;Lonely Among Us&quot; - 8/21/87 - TEASER 5.</p>
<p align="center">10 INT. SENSOR MAINTENANCE ROOM - ON GEORDI AND WORF</p>
<p align="center"> The room is small, busy with equipment, including one<br>
  key console. GEORDI is leaning over the complicated<br>
  console and talking to WORF as he runs a pattern on the<br>
  panel.</p>
<p align="center"> GEORDI<br>
  Why the interest in this, Worf?<br>
  It is just routine maintenance<br>
  on the sensor assemblies.</p>
<p align="center"> WORF<br>
  Simple, Geordi. Our captain<br>
  wants his junior officers to<br>
  learn, learn, learn...</p>
<p align="center"> GEORDI<br>
  (grins)<br>
  Not just the junior ones.<br>
  (indicates)<br>
  Okay, hold this relay off-line<br>

  (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> Worf is where he moved in at the console relay. Geordi<br>
  is standing to one side. Suddenly there is a BRIEF GLOW<br>
  (OPTICAL) from the key console to Worf. The big Klingon<br>
  jerks as though something has struck him, and he<br>
  convulses spasmodically and collapses. Geordi tabs his<br>
  communicator instantly.</p>

<p align="center"> ACT ONE </p>
<p align="center"> FADE IN:</p>
<p align="center">18 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> plunging through space at warp speed, leaving the<br>
  &quot;cloud&quot; behind.</p>
<p align="center">19 INT. SENSOR MAINTENANCE ROOM - ON WORF AND GEORDI</p>
<p align="center"> Worf still lies in a heap on the floor, Geordi leaning<br>
  over him and checking for life signs. Worf begins to<br>
  stir, slowly at first, as the doors SLIDE OPEN and<br>
  Beverly and ASSISTANT ENTER at a dead run, medical<br>
  devices in hand. They quickly kneel at Worf, begin<br>
  checking him.</p>
<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>
  What happened?</p>
<p align="center"> GEORDI<br>
  Don't know. It seemed like he<br>
  was hit by...<br>
  (shakes head)<br>
  ... some sensor feedback, maybe.</p>
<p align="center"> Worf suddenly starts to powerfully flail his arms and<br>
  legs around, struggling against something we can't see.<br>
  The assistant tries to hang on, but Worf's Klingon<br>
  strength sends him across the room. Then, as Worf<br>
  flails at furniture in his way, easily splitting it,<br>
  Beverly has opened the medical kit with quick<br>
  efficiency, pulls out a hypospray, and administers it.</p>
<p align="center">20 CLOSER - EMPHASIZING WORF</p>
<p align="center"> He stops struggling, looks around with eyes that seem<br>
  to be seeing for the first time. An expression of<br>
  wonder and amazement crosses his face. Beverly and<br>
  Geordi exchange a glance, both clearly concerned.</p>
<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>
  Lieutenant Worf?<br>
  (no response)<br>
  Lieutenant, can you hear what I'm<br>
  saying?</p>
<p align="center"> Worf manages a sort of grunt, holds up a hand and<br>
  stares at it. Then he moves his body, trying to get<br>
  his feet under him. He is at first unable to get the<br>
  right coordination down, as though this simple act is<br>
  as foreign to him as it is to a newborn.</p>
<p align="center"> STAR TREK: &quot;Lonely Among Us&quot; - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 
  9.</p>
<p align="center">20 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>
  (continuing)<br>
  Let's get him up.</p>
<p align="center"> They rise. Worf watches and sees how they do it. As<br>
  they both reach down to boost him by the arms, he<br>
  manages to get to his knees and start to push to his<br>
  feet. Beverly is studying him closely. He does not<br>
  seem violent now; he stares around more like a young and<br>
  bewildered child. Beverly nods to Geordi, picks up her<br>
  medical kit, and they start to lead Worf OUT. He moves<br>
  with them, slowly and carefully putting one foot ahead<br>
  of the other.</p>
<p align="center">21 INT. READY ROOM - ANGLE ON GEORDI AND PICARD</p>
<p align="center"> Picard is at his desk, Geordi standing before it.<br>
  Picard looks up at him, frowning as:</p>
<p align="center"> GEORDI<br>
  He was just monitoring the sensor<br>
  console when he jerked as though<br>
  something hit him. What my<br>
  sensors showed...<br>
  (frowns)<br>
  ... It was kind of a... glow... just<br>
  for a second. I can't explain it.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Could your VISOR device have<br>
  malfunctioned?</p>
<p align="center"> GEORDI<br>
  Doubt it, sir. It seemed what<br>
  I was seeing was something real.</p>
<p align="center">22 INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE ON BEVERLY, TROI, WORF</p>
<p align="center"> Worf lies on an examination table, Beverly and assistant<br>
  working over him with her medical scanners. Troi looks<br>
  up at the o.s. medical viewscreen, then back at Worf.<br>
  The Klingon is quiet now, his eyes moving around the<br>
  room and to the women. His attitude is one of quiet and<br>
  deep curiosity. Beverly finishes, smiles down at Worf.</p>
<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>
  I'm going to give you something<br>
  to help you rest. Just relax.</p>
<p align="center"> STAR TREK: &quot;Lonely Among Us&quot; - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 
  10.</p>
<p align="center">22 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> Worf's expression remains unchanged. Beverly brings out<br>
  a hypospray and activates it on his arm. His eyelids<br>
  begin to sag closed almost immediately. Beverly puts<br>
  away the hypospray, motions Troi into her office.</p>
<p align="center">23 INT. CRUSHER'S OFFICE - BEVERLY AND TROI</p>
<p align="center"> on their ENTRY:</p>
<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>
  Fortunately, he's stronger than<br>
  an orbital tug. There's nothing<br>
  physically wrong with him. What<br>
  have you sensed?</p>
<p align="center"> TROI<br>
  Nothing... which bothers me. He<br>
  has never shielded his feelings<br>
  from me. I can't understand why<br>
  he is suddenly doing it now.</p>
<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>
  Are you able to perceive anything<br>
  at all, Counselor? It may be<br>
  important.</p>
<p align="center"> TROI<br>
  (beat; concentrating)<br>
  Perhaps... very faintly.<br>
  Almost... like a frightened<br>
  child.</p>
<p align="center"> BEVERLY<br>
  Worf &quot;frightened?&quot;</p>
<p align="center"> TROI<br>
  It doesn't make much sense but...<br>
  (beat; concentrating)<br>
  Yes, it's fear. Definitely there.</p>
<p align="center"> They exchange puzzled looks.</p>

<p align="center">25 INT. BADAR N'D'D'S QUARTERS - ON TASHA AND<br>
  BADAR N'D'D</p>
<p align="center"> BADAR N'D'D is wraith-thin, pale, with glittering<br>
  lupine eyes; and when he curls his mouth in what looks<br>
  like a smile, some extremely long, sharp canines are<br>
  revealed. His clothing can only be described as<br>
  disreputable -- dark and loose, somehow lumpy (as though<br>
  it hides body parts we don't want to know about).<br>
  Tasha's tremulous smile is offset by a twitch of her<br>
  nose that indicates Anticans don't smell too nice.<br>
  Riker ENTERS.</p>
<p align="center"> TASHA<br>
  Sorry to call you, sir, not<br>
  strictly security, it's about<br>
  the dietary requirements of the<br>
  Antican delegates.</p>
<p align="center">26 INTERCUT RIKER AND TASHA</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  I thought that had been taken care<br>
  of in advance, Tasha.</p>
<p align="center"> TASHA<br>
  So did we, sir. Their live<br>
  animals were beamed aboard -- We<br>
  were going to preserve the meat<br>
  for them, but ....<br>
  (squeamishly)<br>
  ... they say we must bring it to<br>
  them alive.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  (beat)<br>
  Then do so!<br>
  (to the Antican)<br>
  Lieutenant Yar was... confused.<br>
  We no longer enslave animals<br>
  for food purposes.</p>
<p align="center"> BADAR N'D'D<br>
  But we have seen humans eat meat!</p>
<p align="center"> The Antican grins -- a terrifying display of long,<br>
  sharp fangs.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  You've seen something as fresh<br>
  and tasty as living meat, but<br>
  inorganically materialized out<br>
  of patterns used by our<br>
  transporters.</p>
<p align="center"> BADAR N'D'D<br>

<p align="center">27 INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE ON BEVERLY AND WORF (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> Worf lies sedated on one of the beds, being<br>
  automatically monitored by the medical computers.<br>
  Beverly approaches with a medical instrument in hand<br>
  to take some samples. She leans over the bed, using<br>
  the instrument on his arm. As she does, there is a<br>
  SUDDEN SPLIT-SECOND BURST OF ELECTRIC-LIKE ENERGY<br>
  BETWEEN THEM. Beverly is highlighted briefly by a BLUE<br>
  GLOW (OPTICAL). She steps back away from the bed,<br>
  blinking as if trying to assimilate some new<br>
