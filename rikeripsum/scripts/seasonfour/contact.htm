    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. ALIEN MEDICAL FACILITY - CORRIDOR - DAY</p>
  <p> CLOSE ON a wide sliding door opening... TWO MALCORIAN<br>
    MEDICAL TECHNICIANS rush someone on a gurney through<br>
    the doors and into a small room crowded with medical<br>
    equipment for emergency trauma care. The level of<br>
    technology in evidence is approximately mid 21st<br>
    century Earth with just enough differences to tell us<br>
    that this is an alien world. There are two treatment<br>
    bed/tables, cabinets and trays with medical<br>
    instruments, and a display for reading scans. The<br>
    Malcorians are humanoid with a slight difference in<br>
    facial features... their hands are shaped like mittens<br>
    without fingers (and if this is a difficult makeup job,<br>
    they can all wear gloves.)</p>
  <p> There is a sense of urgency as the Technicians rush the<br>
    gurney into the Emergency Room... two young Malcorian<br>
    physicians, NILREM (male) and TAVA (female) quickly<br>
    move equipment and get a table ready for the incoming<br>
    patient. Throughout the following scene, we should<br>
    NOT SEE the face of the man lying on the gurney, but<br>
    he is in Malcorian civilian garb and has a large<br>
    bandage on his head. We may notice he does wear gloves<br>
    (mittens) on his hands. They have the gurney in<br>
    position and the Technicians help to move the victim<br>
    off the gurney and onto the table.</p>
  <p> NILREM<br>
    Ready... lift!</p>
  <p> They all lift and move the victim on the table. The<br>
    Technicians now move away and EXIT.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;First Contact&quot; - 11/28/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The two doctors move with the smooth efficiency of<br>
    hurried professionalism. They begin to attach the<br>
    victim to alien emergency equipment...</p>
  <p> NILREM<br>
    He took a severe blow... possible<br>
    trauma to the telencephalon...</p>
  <p> TAVA<br>
    (examining patient)<br>
    Start fifteen octares of<br>
    quadroline. We'll need a complete<br>
    del-scan series.</p>
  <p> Nilrem takes stethoscope-type device and puts it on the<br>
    patient's STOMACH. Nilrem listens... frowns...</p>
  <p> NILREM<br>
    (incredulous)<br>
    I can't find his cardial organ...</p>
  <p> Tava quickly grabs the patient's wrist...</p>
  <p> TAVA<br>
    What do you mean? I'm reading<br>
    a steady circulation...</p>
  <p> Nilrem goes searching for the heart with his scope...<br>
    moves it around... finally places it on his chest...</p>
  <p> NILREM<br>
    There it is... up here...</p>
  <p> TAVA<br>
    In his digestive tract?</p>
  <p> NILREM<br>
    Have you ever seen anything like<br>
    this... ?</p>
  <p> They exchange a puzzled look and then Nilrem gets back<br>
    to work as Tava gingerly uses his hands to probe the<br>
    man's stomach...</p>
  <p> TAVA<br>
    He's missing three costal struts<br>
    on one side and four on the other...</p>
  <p> NILREM<br>
    You think that's something... look<br>
    at this...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;First Contact&quot; - REV. 11/30/90 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Moving to see Nilrem at the man's feet, having removed<br>
    his shoes and socks, showing toes --</p>
  <p> NILREM<br>
    He has digits on his terminus...</p>
  <p> Reactions... they move to his hands and peel off his<br>
    gloves... to reveal fingers on his hand... more<br>
    reactions. They exchange a look. Look at him.</p>
  <p> TAVA<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    What are you?</p>
  <p> MOVE TO REVEAL RIKER lying unconscious on the table.<br>
    His face has been altered so he looks like a Malcorian.<br>
    On Riker...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;First Contact&quot; - REV. 12/6/90 - ACT ONE 4.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>2 INT. RIKER'S ROOM - DAY</p>
  <p> Close on Riker in a bed, head bandaged, monitors<br>
    working... waking up... he gropes for his bearings a<br>
    second, then reacts as he sees --</p>
  <p>3 ANGLE - A GROUP OF SIX DOCTORS</p>
  <p> including Nilrem and Tava are at the foot of his bed,<br>
    watching him with extraordinary curiosity... Riker<br>
    feels the pain in his head...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> A senior physician (BEREL) has joined the group... an<br>
    overworked man who doesn't need any more in his life<br>
    right now, certainly not an alien in his hospital.</p>
  <p> BEREL<br>
    You're in the crisis room at the<br>
    Sikla Medical Facility. You've<br>
    had a severe injury, but you're<br>
    going to be all right.</p>
  <p> Riker takes this in for a moment... nods again in<br>
    understanding. His head hurts terribly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I was caught in the riot when the<br>
    police moved in... that's the last<br>
    thing I remember.</p>
  <p> BEREL<br>
    Can you tell us your name?</p>
  <p> Riker is careful... it's all starting to come back to<br>
    him and he wants to make sure he doesn't say the wrong<br>
    thing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Rivas. Rivas Jakara.</p>
  <p> BEREL<br>
    Rivas Jakara. Where do you live?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;First Contact&quot; - 11/28/90 - ACT ONE 4A.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (well-rehearsed)<br>
    In the Marta community on the<br>
    southern continent...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;First Contact&quot; - REV. 12/6/90 - ACT ONE 5-5A. </p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TAVA<br>
    You're a long way from home.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Are there any members of your<br>
    family we should notify...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No... I have no family.</p>
  <p> He lifts his hand as if to rub his head and then sees<br>
    the primitive equipment he's attached to.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can't stay here... I have to<br>
    get back...</p>
  <p> BEREL<br>
    You're in no condition to leave<br>
    yet...</p>
  <p> Berel studies him with an experienced eye... doesn't<br>
    believe Riker's telling the truth... still, using very<br>
    good bedside manner, he manages a reluctant grin as<br>
    he moves to a more intimate position, perhaps sitting<br>
    on the corner of the bed...</p>
  <p> BEREL<br>
    There are several... unusual<br>
    things about your case, Mister<br>
    Jakara... your cranial lobes, for<br>
    example. They seem to be surgical<br>
    implants...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I did have some cosmetic<br>
    surgery... to correct a genetic<br>
    birth defect...</p>
  <p> Picking up his hand... looking at the fingers...</p>
  <p> BEREL<br>
    And these? Another birth defect?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;First Contact&quot; - REV. 12/6/90 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (acknowledges, of<br>
    course)<br>
    Yes, isn't that something? My<br>
    father's were the same way...</p>
  <p> NILREM<br>
    (sharp)<br>
    You want us to believe that all<br>
    your abnormalities are inherited<br>
    genetic traits?</p>
  <p> Berel shoots him a look, and Nilrem backs off.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I understand your confusion. My<br>
    personal physician is much more<br>
    familiar with these... genetic<br>
    irregularities... to be honest,<br>
    I'd feel better if I were back<br>
    home under her care...</p>
  <p> BEREL<br>
    Why don't I talk to her about<br>
    that... what's her name?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Crusher... but actually, I'm not<br>
    sure you'll be able to reach her.</p>
  <p> BEREL<br>
    Why not?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    She's taking... a sabbatical.</p>
  <p> A long look by Berel. Then...</p>
  <p> BEREL<br>
    Well, we'll do the best we can<br>
    for you.</p>
  <p> Berel pats him on the wrist, rises. About to leave, a<br>
    'Columbo' afterthought...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;First Contact&quot; - REV. 12/6/90 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> BEREL<br>
    Oh, there was one other thing...<br>
    (he pulls a phaser out<br>
    of his pocket)<br>
    We found this curious looking<br>
    device in your clothes... what<br>
    is it?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Oh, it's just a toy I was taking<br>
    home... a present...</p>
  <p> BEREL<br>
    I thought you didn't have any<br>
    family...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    For a neighbor's child.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Did they find anything else, I<br>
    had one piece of jewelry... a<br>
    metal pin...</p>
  <p> BEREL<br>
    No, I'm sorry. This was all we<br>
    found...</p>
  <p> Berel glances at the others, they all leave. Riker<br>
    immediately breaks his pretense, looks to the heavens<br>
    with an 'oh shoot' look, tries to get up... but pain<br>
    shoots through his head and he must retreat back to<br>
    bed...</p>
  <p>4 INT. MEDICAL FACILITY CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> As the group comes out. Tava moves to Berel...</p>
  <p> NILREM<br>
    (voice rising)<br>
    &quot;Genetic irregularities&quot;?... that<br>
    thing isn't even the same species<br>
    as we are...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;First Contact&quot; - REV. 12/6/90 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEREL<br>
    (looks hard at him)<br>
    Keep your voice down.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The last thing we need is a panic<br>
    in here over some...</p>
  <p> He sighs, cannot bring himself to say it... Nilrem<br>
    finishes it...</p>
  <p> NILREM<br>
    It's all the space flights...<br>
    they've attracted creatures from<br>
    outer space...</p>
  <p> BEREL<br>
    Now, that's exactly the kind of<br>
    thing I don't want to hear ... is<br>
    that understood?</p>
  <p> TAVA<br>
    What are you going to do?</p>
  <p> BEREL<br>
    (sighs)<br>
    With all the medical facilities<br>
    available, why did he have to end<br>
    up here?</p>
  <p> NILREM<br>
    I think we ought to call Central<br>
    Security.</p>
  <p> BEREL<br>
    I'm not calling anybody yet. Not<br>
    until we've done a lot more. A<br>
    lot more. I want his story<br>
    checked out...<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;First Contact&quot; - REV. 12/6/90 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEREL (Cont'd)<br>
    Run a complete search through the<br>
    medical library... be absolutely<br>
    certain there's never been<br>
    anything like him...</p>
  <p> NILREM<br>
    What if there're more of them?<br>
    They could be everywhere...</p>
  <p> BEREL<br>
    (calm down)<br>
    Somebody get Nilrem a calmative.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We ought to see if we can find<br>
    the physician Crusher. And give<br>
    this thing...<br>
    (handing the phaser to<br>
    Nilrem)<br>
    ... to somebody in technical to<br>
    check out.</p>
  <p> On the move --</p>
  <p> TAVA<br>
    What about him?</p>
  <p> BEREL<br>
    Cordon off this wing... I want<br>
    security on his door twenty-nine<br>
    hours a day... and I want this<br>
    kept quiet...<br>
    (frowns)<br>
    They've already questioned my<br>
    judgement on the diagnostic<br>
    center, criticized my resource<br>
    allocations... all they need to<br>
    hear now is that I'm treating<br>
    alien creatures...</p>
  <p> The last is said going away as they turn a corner, down<br>
    a hallway...</p>
  <p>5 EXT. CAPITAL CITY (MATTE SHOT) - DAY</p>
  <p> A large, metropolitan city that could be from mid 21st<br>
    century Earth, with a few alien touches. Moving in on<br>
    an impressive government building...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;First Contact&quot; - REV. 11/30/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>6 INT. DURKEN'S OFFICE - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> DURKEN is the leader of his people and this is a<br>
    fitting office for a man of his stature, oval shaped<br>
    with windows that look outside. Durken himself is in<br>
    his fifties, slight in stature, no Ronald Reagan here,<br>
    there is a gentle, Woodrow Wilson quality, thoughtful,<br>
    brilliant, committed. With him here is MIRASTA, a<br>
    woman 30-35 years old, and the Minister for Internal<br>
    Security, KROLA. He is older than Durken, with a keen<br>
    intellect and piercing eyes. Two other non-speaking<br>
    members of the cabinet are present.</p>
  <p> Mirasta, the Minister of Science, is displaying a star<br>
    chart with some rough animation on a wall monitor...</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    At twelve-point-four after launch,<br>
    the warp field generator will be<br>
    activated...</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    That's when it would break the<br>
    light barrier?</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    Yes, Chancellor. If we're<br>
    successful, the craft will leave<br>
    our star system in a matter of<br>
    minutes and will be on its way<br>
    toward the Garth system...</p>
  <p> KROLA<br>
    (non-supportive)<br>
    And then what?</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    (with a disarming smile)<br>
    And then, Krola, we'll see what's<br>
    there...</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    How long, Mirasta?</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    We have the prototype design for<br>
    the warp engine... it would simply<br>
    be a matter of building the<br>
    actual production units. If I<br>
    get your approval today... ten<br>
    months, maybe less.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;First Contact&quot; - REV. 11/30/90 - ACT ONE 10A.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Krola shakes his head, but is extremely pleasant and<br>
    politic throughout... this is an argument they've had<br>
    many times before, there is even a smile on his face...</p>
  <p> KROLA<br>
    Chancellor, I'll admit Mirasta's<br>
    enthusiasm for her work is<br>
    seductive, but perhaps we're<br>
    moving too fast...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;First Contact&quot; - REV. 11/30/90 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    (acknowledging, with<br>
    humor)<br>
    As fast as the speed of light,<br>
    Krola...</p>
  <p> KROLA<br>
    Why am I always the only realist<br>
    in a room full of dreamers... ?</p>
  <p> All laugh...</p>
  <p> KROLA<br>
    Please, I must be serious...<br>
    there was another demonstration<br>
    today... some violence. Your<br>
    opponents will see this as another<br>
    example of your determination to<br>

    traditional ways...</p>
  <p> Durken stands, moves as he talks...</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    My opponents look back as I look<br>
    forward. I cannot believe that<br>
    my people would choose to retreat<br>
    after all we've done...</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    I agree.</p>
  <p> KROLA<br>
    The people were willing to accept<br>
    your social reforms because they<br>
    believe in you, Chancellor. But<br>
    there are many who say we have<br>
    gone far enough... all of these<br>
    new ideas... new technology...<br>
    and now space travel... it<br>
    confuses them, frightens them...</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    And I will not allow them to<br>
    remain in the dark ages... the<br>
    warp program will proceed as you<br>
    have outlined, Mirasta...<br>
    (beat, smiles to Krola)<br>
    And then we will slow down, Krola,<br>
    to let everyone catch their breath<br>
    including you...</p>

  <p>7 INT. MIRASTA'S LAB - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> From this room, a person can personally supervise and<br>
    control rocket launches, satellite operations, radio<br>
    and optical telescope functions, receive telemetry,<br>
    etc. If the head of NASA wanted to be completely<br>
    &quot;hands-on&quot; in the next fifty years, this is the kind<br>
    of place he/she would have. There should be computers,<br>
    monitors, printers, observational equipment, models<br>
    of spacecraft, etc.</p>
  <p> Mirasta enters... sits down at one of the computer<br>
    monitors and taps in a few commands.</p>
  <p> Behind her, Picard and Troi MATERIALIZE. Mirasta<br>
    turns in her chair toward the door reacting to the<br>
    noise... Picard is dressed in his uniform, Deanna in<br>
    conservative civilian garb. They are not posing as<br>
    aliens.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Excuse me, Mirasta Yale?</p>
  <p> She glances at them curiously.</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    Yes?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My name is Jean-Luc Picard. This<br>
    is my associate Deanna Troi. May<br>
    we come in?</p>
  <p> Mirasta is already on her feet... their appearance is<br>
    clearly not of local origin.</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    Who are you?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Please don't be alarmed by our<br>
    appearance... we've come with<br>
    some... important information.</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    About what?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    About space. About the universe<br>
    you are preparing to enter.</p>
  <p> Off her look...</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    We are from a federation of<br>
    planets, Mirasta... Captain Picard<br>
    is from a planet called Earth more<br>
    than two thousand light years from<br>
    here. I am from another planet<br>
    called Betazed.</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Uh huh.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have been monitoring your<br>
    progress toward warp drive<br>
    capability. When a society<br>
    reaches your level of technology<br>
    and is clearly about to initiate<br>
    warp travel, we believe it is time<br>
    to make first contact. We prefer<br>
    meeting like this rather than a<br>
    random confrontation in deep<br>
    space.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We've come to you first because<br>
    you are a leader in the scientific<br>
    community. And scientists can<br>
    generally accept our arrival more<br>
    easily than others.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We almost always encounter fear<br>
    and shock on this sort of mission.<br>
    We hope you will be able to help<br>
    facilitate our introduction.</p>
  <p> A beat as Mirasta digests this, then...</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    Is this a joke? Did Lupo and the<br>
    others at the lab put you up to<br>
    this?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (grins)<br>
    I assure you this is no joke.<br>
    (holding up his hands)<br>
    You can see we are quite<br>
    physically different than<br>
    Malcorians.<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Welcome aboard.</p>
  <p> And this is standard procedure. Worf is there for<br>
    security precautions. Beverly is there in case the<br>

    It's beyond words... everything<br>
    I've ever dreamed about...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    When I was a child, my parents<br>
    would take me to the<br>
    planetarium... and we would sit<br>
    in the dark and it was as if I<br>
    was on a spaceship on my way to<br>
    another world... to meet people<br>
    from other planets...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Now that you're about to travel<br>
    beyond your own solar system, you<br>
    will meet a great many more people<br>
    from other planets, Mirasta...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Federation prefers to make<br>
    first contact like this... rather<br>
    than a random confrontation in<br>
    deep space.</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    A part of me still expects the<br>
    lights to come up as the program<br>
    ends...</p>
  <p> They sit at a table looking down at the planet...</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    How did you know about me?</p>
  <p> This becomes a little more touchy and Picard and Troi<br>
    are well experienced in breaking the ground...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We try to learn as much as<br>
    possible about a planet before<br>
    first contact.</p>

    your humor... try to better<br>
    understand you as a people...</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    I hate to think how you would<br>
    judge us based on our popular<br>
    music and entertainment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    To be sure, we get an incomplete<br>
    picture from long distance...<br>
    that's why we also do on-surface<br>
    reconnaissance.</p>
  <p> Mirasta does not react negatively to this and has yet<br>
    to grasp the hard realities of what lies ahead... she's<br>
    enchanted by the moment... her reaction is almost like<br>
    she's just been let in on a wonderful secret...</p>

    You've had people on our planet?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    For several years.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (off her reaction)<br>
    We've found that the most<br>
    hazardous aspect of this kind<br>
    of mission is a lack of sufficient<br>
    information...</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    You don't have to explain. I<br>
    understand.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But not everyone on my planet<br>
    would. They'd think you were<br>
    trying to infiltrate our society.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We do have a complication here,<br>
    Mirasta. One of our people is<br>
    missing. My first officer,<br>

    He was on the surface to<br>

    our observation team when he<br>
    disappeared. Our people have made<br>
    inquiries... but we have not been<br>
    able to locate him. If there's<br>
    any way you can help...</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    Of course. Where was Riker's last<br>

  <p> Mirasta acknowledges.</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    We've got to find him before<br>
    someone realizes what he really<br>
    is... if this gets out prematurely,<br>
    it will seriously complicate<br>
    matters.</p>
  <p> And now she begins to take stock of what is<br>
    forthcoming.</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    Introducing you to this world<br>
    will not be an easy matter.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It never is.</p>
  <p> MIRASTA</p>
  <p> You must already know that my<br>
    people are in a transitory<br>
    stage... an old staid culture<br>
    has been pulled into the future<br>
    by Chancellor Durken... but it<br>
    is not easy to discard deep-rooted<br>
    beliefs. Our entire ideology is<br>
    based on the assumption that the<br>
    Malcorian is the supreme lifeform<br>
    and that our world is the center<br>
    of the universe. Your arrival<br>
    will change our entire<br>
    understanding of life...<br>
    (beat, frankly)<br>
    Some will not want it to change.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What about Durken?</p>

  <p>10 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    Durken will be open-minded. But<br>
    cautious. I strongly suggest that<br>
    you do not discuss your<br>
    surveillance teams with him...<br>
    not right away at least.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But, with the disappearance of<br>
    Commander Riker, wouldn't it be<br>
    prudent...</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Captain Picard, you must trust<br>
    me on this. If you tell the<br>
    Chancellor about Commander Riker,<br>
    it would undermine everything you<br>
    hope to accomplish here.<br>
    (Picard and Troi react)<br>
    Durken would assign Krola, the<br>
    Minister of Security, to find him.<br>
    Krola has his own political<br>
    agenda. He will perceive you as<br>
    the greatest threat my people have<br>
    ever known. And he will not<br>
    hesitate to use Riker to prove<br>
    he is correct.</p>
  <p> Off Picard's reaction...</p>

    Mister Jakara, this new era of<br>

    that turn out to be weather<br>
    balloons.</p>

  <p> BEREL<br>

  <p> DURKEN<br>
    Captain Picard. Is there<br>
    somewhere we might speak together?<br>
    Without distraction?</p>
  <p> Picard nods.</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    Chancellor, with your permission,<br>
    I will... beam back to the<br>
    surface.<br>
    (with a glance toward<br>
    Picard, re: Riker)<br>
    I have several matters to attend<br>
    to.</p>

    No, Minister. He has not returned<br>

  <p> Picard pours two glasses from his bottle of Chateau<br>
    Picard...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've been saving this for a<br>
    special occasion. My brother on<br>
    Earth produces fruit known as<br>
    grapes which he turns into wine.<br>
    He's really quite good at it.</p>
  <p> He raises the two glasses... offers one to Durken.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have a tradition, Chancellor,<br>
    called a toast... a drink to<br>
    salute one's friends and good<br>
    fortune. I propose a toast to<br>
    a new friendship.</p>
  <p> They drink.</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    (surprised, recognizing<br>
    the taste)<br>
    We have something very much like<br>
    this here on Malcor Three.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am sure we will find much in<br>
    common.</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    And much that is not in common.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    An opportunity to learn from one<br>
    another.</p>
  <p> Durken studies Picard, stands, thoughtful...</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    You speak the language of<br>
    diplomacy very well, Captain<br>
    Picard... it is a language I<br>
    appreciate and understand... but<br>
    I have learned to not always trust<br>
    it...</p>

    Chancellor, we are not here to<br>

    you we will not interfere with<br>

    planet... that is, in fact, our<br>
    Prime Directive.</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>

    Is that your way of maintaining<br>
    superiority?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    To instantly transform a society<br>

    You're right of course.<br>

    I am overwhelmed, Captain Picard.<br>
    Quite overwhelmed.<br>
    (looks out the window)<br>
    I come home each night to a loving<br>
    wife and two beautiful<br>
    daughters... we eat the evening<br>
    meal together as a family, I feel<br>
    that's important... and they<br>
    always ask me if I've had a good<br>
    day.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How shall you answer them tonight,<br>
    Chancellor?</p>
  <p> Durken turns...</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    Well, I'll have to say... this<br>
    morning, I was the leader of the<br>
    universe as I knew it... this<br>
    afternoon, I am only a voice in<br>
    a chorus.<br>

  <p> Riker is on his feet, battling the pain in his head and<br>
    dizziness... he looks in the closet and finds the<br>
    clothes he wore when he was brought in, starts to get<br>
    dressed...</p>
  <p>21 ANGLE - THE WINDOW</p>
  <p> he examines it... it is sealed shut... as he begins<br>
    to look for something he can use to break it, a nurse<br>
    (LANEL) ENTERS the room. She stops short as she sees<br>
    Riker at the window, but instead of crying out for<br>
    help, she glances out toward the guard and allows the<br>
    door to close with her inside. She is quite nervous.</p>
  <p> LANEL<br>
    There are guards out there.<br>
    You'll never escape that way.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts, curious about suddenly having an ally...</p>
  <p> LANEL<br>
    (tentative)<br>
    I'm not afraid of you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Good. Because there's nothing<br>
    to be afraid of...</p>
  <p> LANEL<br>
    We shouldn't fear the unknown.<br>
    We should embrace it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Can you help me get out of here?</p>
  <p> LANEL<br>
    Are you really an alien? It's<br>
    all right to tell me.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, I'm not an alien...</p>
  <p> LANEL<br>
    I don't believe you. You are an<br>
    alien.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    To the left. All right. Let's<br>
    do it.</p>
  <p> LANEL<br>
    Why should I?</p>
  <p> Riker takes a deep breath... moves closer to her...<br>
    with dramatic flair...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You know why. Because I don't<br>
    belong here. Because I have to<br>
    get back to my ship in space.</p>
  <p> She looks into his eyes.</p>

  <p> LANEL<br>
    It's not so much to ask. And then<br>
    I'll help you escape.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's not that easy. There are...<br>

    Nilrem jumps on his back, Riker throws him off, but<br>

  <p> BEREL<br>
    I'm just a physician, Minister.<br>
    I don't know much about affairs<br>
    of state. But he is a living,<br>
    intelligent being. I don't care<br>
    if the Chancellor himself calls<br>
    down here. I have sworn an oath<br>
    to do no harm. And I will not.</p>
  <p> KROLA<br>

    Yes, she's tried to accept the<br>
    responsibility.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a long, thoughtful beat... then nods.<br>
    Cut your losses and start to rebuild...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're right. It was my error,<br>
    not hers.</p>
  <p> Picard rises.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;First Contact&quot; - REV. 12/5/90 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Chancellor, no starship mission<br>
    is more dangerous than first<br>
    contact. We never know what we<br>
    face when we open the door to a<br>
    new world. How will we be<br>
    greeted? What are the dangers?<br>
    Centuries ago, a disastrous first<br>
    contact with the Klingon Empire<br>
    led to decades of war. It was<br>
    decided then that we must do<br>
    surveillance before making<br>
    contact. It was a controversial<br>
    decision. But I believe it<br>
    prevents more problems than it<br>
    creates.</p>
  <p> Durken leans back, more comfortable with what Picard is<br>
    saying, but still not satisfied...</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    I appreciate the logic of your<br>
    position, Captain. But it would<br>
    seem a full disclosure after<br>
    contact would have been in order.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    In time, there would have been<br>
    full disclosure. I know I can<br>
    only ask you to believe that.<br>
    On some worlds, it is not even<br>
    an issue. But here, everything<br>
    our observers reported suggested<br>
    the people of this world would<br>
    almost certainly react negatively<br>
    to our arrival. We could see<br>
    our surveillance might even be<br>
    interpreted as an act of<br>
    aggression.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I was hoping that we would find<br>
    Commander Riker before you did...<br>
    so the matter would not<br>
    complicate our introduction. And<br>
    it was a mistake.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;First Contact&quot; - REV. 12/6/90 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> A more open expression appears on Durken's face... he<br>
    almost smiles.</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    A mistake I might have made in<br>
    your place.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I rather like it actually.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Like it?</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    That you make mistakes like any<br>
    man.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh, I've made some fine ones in<br>
    my time.</p>
  <p> There is another connection between the two men that<br>
    goes a long way toward healing this rift.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Will you release my officer?</p>
  <p> And Durken never changes expression and his eyes never<br>
    leave Picard's...</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    We'll talk again later, Captain.</p>
  <p> That's the best Picard can do for now. He<br>

    consciousness... he is in bad shape... the pain in his<br>
    head is suffocating and yet the drugs in his system<br>
    won't let him rest... there is a drugged intensity in<br>
    his eyes... on the monitors, graphs measuring his life<br>
    signs make beeping sounds which move more quickly as<br>
    the drugs take hold. He cannot raise his head. As we<br>
    pull back, he sees Krola and Nilrem.</p>
  <p> KROLA<br>

    Leave us.</p>
  <p> Nilrem EXITS. Krola moves closer to Riker. He is<br>

  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    Thank you for seeing me.</p>
  <p> Durken looks at her, still disappointed.</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    If I did not depend so much on<br>
    your expertise in space matters,<br>
    I would have asked for your<br>
    resignation.</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    I felt I was acting in the best<br>
    interests of our people,<br>
    Chancellor.</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    (sharp)<br>
    When you are selected to occupy<br>
    this office, then you'll have the<br>
    privilege of deciding the best<br>
    interests of our people.<br>
    (softens, personal)<br>
    Picard, I can excuse. But you,<br>
    Mirasta, you should have trusted<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> Her eyes drop, she nods, understands.</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>

    Chancellor -- we must release<br>
    Riker to Picard... Any hope for<br>

  <p> DURKEN<br>

    I am prepared to release Riker<br>
    after we've interrogated him...</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    Are you prepared for him to die,<br>
    Chancellor?<br>
    (off Durken's look)<br>
    His injuries are extremely<br>
    serious. A mob at the medical<br>
    facility almost killed him. Krola<br>
    has ordered drugs to be used to<br>
    revive him for questioning, drugs<br>
    that are dangerous in his<br>
    condition. Without medical aid<br>
    from his ship, I believe Riker<br>
    will not survive the day. You<br>
    must tell Picard where he is.</p>
  <p> Off Durken's look...</p>
  <p>35 INT. RIKER'S ROOM - DAY</p>
  <p> The interrogation continues. Riker is exhausted.</p>
  <p> KROLA<br>
    You have lied since the moment<br>

    you are lying now, Commander.</p>

    such lethal weapons?</p>
  <p> Riker looks at the phaser...</p>

  <p> KROLA<br>

    to be sure.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It is... for defense...</p>
  <p> The beeper on the medical monitor flutters... Riker's<br>
    eyelids come halfway down... Krola glances at the<br>
    machines...</p>
  <p> KROLA<br>
    Perhaps, like many conquerors,<br>
    you believe your goals to be<br>
    benevolent. I cannot. For<br>
    however you would describe your<br>
    intentions, you still represent<br>
    the end to my way of life. I<br>
    cannot permit that to occur.</p>

    to welcome your people with arms<br>
    open and eyes closed. I must<br>

  <p> He puts the phaser in Riker's limp hand... aims it at<br>
    himself...</p>
  <p> KROLA<br>
    When they find us, I will be dead,<br>
    killed by your weapon. The lines<br>
    will be drawn. A peaceful accord<br>
    will no longer be an option.</p>

  <p> DURKEN (Cont'd)<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    ... but my people are not ready<br>
    to accept what you represent.<br>
    Everything that happened at the<br>
    hospital proves it. Krola is the<br>
    best evidence of all. We must<br>
    slow down and allow all those like<br>
    him to join us in the present<br>
    before we move into the future.</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    But when we encounter other beings<br>
    in space, our people must be<br>
    ready...</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    The warp program will have to be<br>
    delayed... we will divert more<br>
    resources into education and<br>
    social development to prepare for<br>
    the day when we are ready.</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    Chancellor, I strongly disagree.</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    (nods, sadly)<br>
    I know.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Captain Picard, you once said that<br>
    if I ask you to leave, you would<br>
    without hesitation. I'm afraid<br>
    I must ask you to do just that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is your decision, Chancellor.<br>
    But I must say I regret that we<br>
    won't have the opportunity of<br>
    knowing your people better.</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    We are a good people, Captain.<br>
    A society with much potential.<br>
    Once we cross this threshold of<br>
    space, we will have to give up<br>
    the self-importance, the conceit<br>
    that we are the center of the<br>
    universe.<br>

  <p> DURKEN (Cont'd)<br>
    But this is not the time. For<br>
    now, it is better that we continue<br>
    to enjoy that sweet innocence.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But how can you keep us a<br>
    secret... when so many have seen<br>
    and heard so much?</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    The stories will be told for many<br>
    years, I have no doubt... of the<br>
    ship that made contact... of an<br>
    alien who was held prisoner in<br>
    a medical facility... there will<br>
    be charges of a government<br>
    cover-up... some of the witnesses<br>
    will tell their tales and most<br>
    people will laugh at them and go<br>
    back and watch more interesting<br>
    fiction on the daily broadcasts.<br>
    It will pass.</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    I'm sorry to say... he's probably<br>
    right.</p>
  <p> Picard rises.</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    Captain, I have one last<br>
    request... take me with you.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts, glances at Durken.</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    (tacit approval)<br>
    She will be unhappy with the<br>
    restrictions I must place on her<br>
    at home, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Mirasta)<br>
    We may not be back in your<br>
    lifetime. And I have to believe<br>
    that you are not fully prepared<br>
    for the risks of space, Mirasta...</p>

  <p>42 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> MIRASTA<br>
    I have been prepared for the risks<br>
    of space since I was nine years<br>
    old sitting in a planetarium.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, to my Ready Room...</p>
  <p> Worf ENTERS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Escort Chancellor Durken to the<br>
    transporter room, Lieutenant...<br>
    and then assign quarters to<br>
    Minister Yale. She'll be staying<br>
    on board.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Until we return then...</p>
  <p> DURKEN<br>
    With luck, we will both still<br>
    be around to renew our friendship,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> As they EXIT...</p>
  <p>43 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As the ship slowly moves out of orbit, leaving the<br>
    planet behind.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
