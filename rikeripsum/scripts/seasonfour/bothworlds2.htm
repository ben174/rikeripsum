  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>8 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Alone... The Borg ship is gone.</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    First Officer's Log, Stardate<br>
    43999.1. The Borg ship has<br>
    resumed its course toward Earth.<br>
    We are unable to pursue pending<br>
    repairs to the Enterprise.</p>
  <p>9 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Geordi, Troi, Worf, Beverly and Shelby. Admiral<br>
    Hanson is on the viewscreen; he is in his Ready Room on<br>
    a Galaxy Starship.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    ... and as we anticipated, the<br>
    blast burned out the main<br>
    navigational deflector... we also<br>
    have damage to shields and the<br>
    reactor core.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We should be back up in eight to<br>
    twelve hours, Admiral.</p>
  <p> Hanson frowns, acknowledges...</p>
  <p> HANSON<br>
    Well, we'll miss you at the party.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Enterprise will be there, sir.<br>
    Maybe a little late. But we'll<br>
    be there.</p>
  <p> HANSON<br>
    Your engagements gave us valuable<br>
    time. We've mobilized a fleet<br>
    of forty starships at Wolf 359<br>
    and that's just for starters...<br>
    the Klingons are sending<br>
    warships... Hell, we've even<br>
    thought about opening<br>
    communications with the<br>
    Romulans...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Worlds&quot; Part Two - REV. 7/10/90 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    You realize, Admiral, that with<br>
    the assistance of Picard, the Borg<br>
    will be prepared for your<br>
    defenses.</p>
  <p> Hanson takes a long beat as though he's considering<br>
    the dreadful ramifications of this fact. But that's<br>
    not what he's thinking about at all. He finally<br>
    speaks.</p>
  <p> HANSON<br>
    Lieutenant... a few years ago,<br>
    I watched a freshman cadet pass<br>
    four upper classman on the last<br>
    hill of the forty kilometer run<br>
    on Danula Two... damndest thing<br>
    I ever saw... only freshman to<br>
    ever win the Academy marathon.<br>
    I made it my business to get to<br>
    know that young fellow... got to<br>
    know him very very well... I'll<br>
    tell ya, I've never known anyone<br>
    with more drive, determination<br>
    or more courage than Jean-Luc<br>
    Picard. There's no way in hell<br>
    he would assist the Borg. I<br>
    want that clear.</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    Of course, Admiral...</p>
  <p> HANSON<br>
    He is a casualty of war.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Then... we have abandoned all hope<br>
    of recovering him.</p>
  <p> HANSON<br>
    (reluctantly<br>
    acknowledges)<br>
    In less than twenty-four hours,<br>
    this armada's going to hit that<br>
    Borg vessel with everything we<br>
    can muster. Either they survive<br>
    or we do. As for Picard...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    A great man has been lost. Your<br>
    Captain. My friend.</p>
  <p> He sighs, looks down a beat and then up.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Worlds&quot; Part Two - REV. 7/3/90 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> HANSON<br>
    Commander Riker... I hereby<br>
    promote you to the field<br>
    commission of Captain.</p>
  <p> Push in on Riker...</p>
  <p> HANSON<br>
    The Enterprise is your ship now.<br>
    Congratulations. I wish the<br>
    circumstances were different.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Good luck, Admiral.</p>
  <p> HANSON<br>
    To us all.</p>
  <p> He signs off.</p>
  <p>10 EXT. SPACE - THE BORG SHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> warping toward Earth.</p>
  <p>11 INT. BORG SHIP</p>
  <p> Moving down a row... no activity... the Borg are in<br>
    their regenerative state, in their compartments...<br>
    finding Locutus in a compartment, 'asleep'... a shudder<br>
    crosses his face as though a nightmare has invaded his<br>
    mind... suddenly his eyes open in a panic...</p>
  <p>12 MATTE SHOT - THE BORG SHIP INTERIOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> An agonizing human cry echoes through the chamber...</p>
  <p>13 A BORG IN HIS COMPARTMENT</p>
  <p> reacts to the commotion... methodically EXITS and moves<br>
    to Locutus, who resists his efforts to restrain him...<br>
    another Borg joins them... together they escort him<br>
    out of his compartment...</p>
  <p>14 INT. BORG OPERATING ROOM - MONTAGE SEQUENCE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Small and no different than any other area of the ship<br>
    except there is a medical table...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Worlds&quot; Part Two - REV. 7/3/90 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Locutus is lying on his back, conscious as one Borg<br>
    prepares to use a long, probing implant device to add a<br>
    bio-chip... another Borg prepares a huge mechanical arm<br>
    to attach... and as we slowly push in to Locutus'<br>
    face... and into his eye... a single tear is in one<br>
    corner... and as the operation commences, his eyes<br>
    close and after a beat, slowly, the color in his human<br>
    face begins to drain further and further away until<br>
    he is ashen white.</p>
  <p>15 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Riker stands at the window, now wearing a Captain's<br>
    rank, looks around... moves closer to Picard's<br>
    desk... and studies the empty chair... and it is a<br>
    symbol of the man... and he cannot bring himself to<br>
    sit there. So he sits in the chair he always sits<br>
    in... facing the Captain's desk. A chime. He<br>
    reacts... stands...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Troi ENTERS. Riker is glad to see her, smiles, warm.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hi.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You wanted to see me?</p>
  <p> And already it's different between them... he is the<br>
    Captain now and that inherently creates an emotional<br>
    barrier.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How's the crew?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Throwing themselves into the work<br>
    to be done... the emotional impact<br>
    hasn't been fully realized yet...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (understands)<br>
    I guess Starfleet training kicks<br>
    in and takes over...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Worlds&quot; Part Two - REV. 7/6/90 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    We know the risks, tell ourselves<br>
    we're prepared for the<br>
    consequences... and yet, something<br>
    like this cuts deeper than we can<br>
    admit at first. He was our<br>
    Captain. It's like losing the<br>
    leader of a nation or the head<br>
    of a family.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    He was more of a father to me than<br>
    my own.</p>
  <p> Troi nods sympathetically...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    When I saw him like that...<br>
    mutilated...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You did what you had to do...<br>
    nobody doubts your love for him...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Was there any part of him left,<br>
    Deanna?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (slow)<br>
    Yes. I can still sense his<br>
    humanity</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (looks down)<br>
    Then you must have sensed his<br>
    pain...</p>
  <p> Her silence tells him she does.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't envy your abilities.</p>
  <p> He cannot stay with the intensity of this moment...<br>
    Breaking the tension --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Worlds&quot; Part Two - REV. 7/6/90 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'd better check on the progress<br>
    of our repairs...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    There won't be any changes... as<br>
    far as I'm concerned it's his<br>
    ship, his crew... and everything<br>
    we do, every battle we fight, it's<br>
    for him.<br>
    (beat, warm)<br>
    I'm glad you're here to help me<br>
    with this.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Thank you, Captain.</p>
  <p> And as they both realize their intimacy will be never<br>
    quite the same again.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (dismissed)<br>
    Counselor...</p>
  <p> Their eyes say more than their words. And as she<br>
    leaves, we stay a beat on him as he begins to realize<br>
    it's lonely at the top and he glances once more at --</p>
  <p>16 THE DESK</p>
  <p> and the empty chair... where he still has not been<br>
    seated.</p>
  <p>17 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> as it opens and Riker and Worf ENTER.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    ... and Mister Crusher has<br>
    suggested a chip might be designed<br>
    that will automatically retune<br>
    phasers to a random setting after<br>
    each discharge...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That would be a great advantage.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Worlds&quot; Part Two - REV. 7/13/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We should also see if we can find<br>
    some way to neutralize their<br>
    forcefields, Worf... we've got<br>
    to show them we can adapt too.<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Engineering.<br>
    (continuing to Worf)<br>
    We're not just fighting the Borg<br>
    anymore... we're fighting the life<br>
    experience they've stolen from<br>
    Captain Picard... how the hell<br>
    do we defeat an enemy that knows<br>
    us better than we know<br>
    ourselves... ?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The Borg have neither honor nor<br>
    courage... that is our greatest<br>
    advantage.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I hope it's enough.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Worlds&quot; Part Two - REV. 7/13/90 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> The doors open. They EXIT...</p>
  <p>18 OMITTED</p>
  <p>19 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> The warp reactor where Geordi and Shelby are<br>
    supervising repairs, checking panels, sensors...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Engine control processors are back<br>
    up...</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    Accelerator coils are responding<br>
    normally...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Forward shields at fifty-eight<br>
    percent... aft shields --<br>
    (reacts as he studies<br>
    sensors)<br>
    Sensors must be down...</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    Checking... sensors are fine...<br>
    no, aft shields have completely<br>
    failed... dammit... auxiliary<br>
    generators are out again...</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf ENTER. Seeing Worf --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Worlds&quot; Part Two - REV. 7/27/90 - ACT ONE 11A.</p>
  <p> CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Just the man I need.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    We're having problems with the<br>
    aft shields... generators are<br>
    going on and off line... I could<br>
    use your help, Worf...</p>
  <p> Riker nods his approval. Geordi and Worf start to<br>
    move...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Worlds&quot; Part Two - REV. 7/2/90 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How soon do we get underway,<br>
    Geordi?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Still a couple hours... Commander<br>
    Shelby can fill you in...</p>
  <p> Geordi and Worf EXIT... Riker and Shelby are alone...<br>
    the first time they've been alone since the big<br>
    Turbolift argument... and the tension of their<br>
    relationship hangs over the scene.</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    The main navigational deflector<br>
    is functional again... Sherbourne<br>
    and Barclay are running through<br>
    the final testing sequence now...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The warp reactor core?</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    Reconstruction is proceeding<br>
    normally... it's slow work. If<br>
    we can nail down this shield<br>
    generator problem, I agree with<br>
    La Forge... we should be at<br>
    operating capacity in two or three<br>
    hours...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> An uncomfortable beat of silence as they study each<br>
    other...</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    Anything else, sir?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes. You did a good job on the<br>
    Borg ship.</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    I didn't get Picard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You stopped them. You gave us<br>
    our shot.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Commander, we don't have to like<br>

    In fact, I expect you to continue<br>
    to keep me on my toes.</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>

    you, Shelby...</p>

    chutzpa.</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Captain Riker, based on our past<br>
    relationship, there's no reason<br>
    I should expect to become your<br>
    first officer... except you need<br>
    me. I know how to get things<br>
    done. And I have the expertise<br>
    in the Borg...</p>

    service to this ship. But right<br>
    now, I need your experience at<br>
    tactical... Mister Data, I<br>
    realize that your very nature<br>
    omits ambition. Nevertheless,<br>
    I want you to know I thought<br>
    seriously about you as first<br>
    officer as well...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you, sir...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But this is not a time for change.<br>
    I need you all where you are,<br>
    where Captain Picard always relied<br>
    on you.<br>
    (with some tongue-in-cheek)<br>
    I have been... reluctantly...<br>
    forced to conclude that Commander<br>
    Shelby, our expert on the Borg,<br>
    is the ideal choice at this time<br>
    for first officer.</p>

    Well, actually Guinan... right<br>

  <p> GUINAN<br>

    and again, when one of us needed<br>
    to... I guess I'm just used to<br>
    having the Captain's ear...</p>
  <p> And sacrilege as it might be, she sits behind the desk<br>
    in the Captain's chair. Riker reacts.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I hope I'm not imposing.</p>
  <p> Riker studies her, let's get this over with.</p>

    I've heard a lot of people talking<br>
    down in Ten Forward... They<br>
    expect to be dead in the next day<br>

  <p> It is said casually, stating a fact... A beat as Riker<br>
    studies her, wonders what she's getting at.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>

    They like you, Riker. They trust<br>
    you. But they don't believe<br>
    anyone can save them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (defensive)<br>
    I'm not sure anyone can.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    The way I see things, if a man<br>
    is convinced he's gonna die<br>
    tomorrow, he'll probably find some<br>
    way to make it happen.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The only one who can turn that<br>

    I'll do the best I can.</p>

    You'll have to do something you<br>
    don't want to do.<br>
    (off his look)<br>
    Let go of Picard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (calmly angry)<br>
    Maybe you didn't hear --<br>
    yesterday, I tried to kill him.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You tried to kill whatever that<br>
    is on the Borg ship. Not Picard.<br>
    Picard is still here, still in<br>

    from us a piece at a time.</p>
  <p> They study each other a long beat. Both feel the loss<br>
    intensely.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Did he ever tell you why we were<br>
    so close?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Then I'm not going to tell you<br>
    either. But it was beyond<br>
    friendship, beyond family... and<br>
    I will let him go. You must,<br>
    too.<br>

    You must let him go, Riker. It's<br>
    the only way to beat him... the<br>
    only way to save him.</p>
  <p> He reacts. She stands.</p>
