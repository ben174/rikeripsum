    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship at warp.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 44995.3.<br>
    We are en route to the Klingon<br>
    Home World, where I will<br>
    participate in the installation<br>
    ceremony of Gowron, the next<br>
    designated Leader of the High<br>
    Council.</p>
  <p>2 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> WORF is practicing a form of martial art in front of a<br>
    large mirror. He is dressed in a workout gi and is<br>
    practicing a graceful and fluid kata using his<br>
    bat'telth sword... he's been at this for a while and is<br>
    disheveled and sweaty.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This visit should also provide<br>
    an opportunity for one of my<br>
    officers to correct... a grave<br>
    injustice..</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES. Worf finishes the routine before<br>
    answering.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Enter.</p>
  <p> PICARD ENTERS and Worf is caught off-guard. He is<br>
    immediately embarrassed at receiving his captain in<br>
    this manner.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Am I intruding?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No, sir. My apologies, Captain...<br>
    I can be back in uniform---</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - 4/8/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That won't be necessary.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm not here as your captain.<br>
    I'm here as the person that stood<br>
    with you before the High<br>
    Council... your cha'DIch.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts to the word... disturbing memories that<br>
    have been on his mind recently. He sets the sword on a<br>
    nearby table. After a beat...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We'll arrive at your Home World<br>
    in less than a day.</p>
  <p> Picard lets that hang in the air for a moment. Worf<br>
    understands the unspoken question... thinks for a<br>
    beat... then turns back to Picard.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is not yet time.</p>
  <p> Picard half-expected that answer. His attitude is<br>
    intimate... personal... they're two men who stood<br>
    shoulder to shoulder during a difficult time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That doesn't sound like the man<br>
    who came to me a year ago...<br>
    fiercely determined to return home<br>
    and clear his father's name...<br>
    or die trying.</p>
  <p> Worf doesn't answer... Picard goes on after a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You accepted this... dishonor from<br>
    the Council in order to hold the<br>
    Empire together.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The Empire survives. Isn't it<br>
    time to confront the Council...<br>
    to regain your family name and<br>
    let the truth be known?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have been told... that patience<br>
    is sometimes a more effective<br>
    weapon than a sword.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - 4/8/91 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard smiles a little, recognizing one of his own<br>
    lessons.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Patience is a... human virtue,<br>
    one which I am proud to see you've<br>
    taken to heart. But this<br>
    situation may require a more...<br>
    Klingon response.</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing, frank)<br>
    Your discommendation is a facade<br>
    intended to protect men less<br>
    honorable than you. It is a<br>
    lie... and lies must be<br>
    challenged.</p>
  <p> Worf hears the words... he's struggling with the logic<br>
    of Picard's argument.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have grown... weary of bearing<br>
    this dishonor...</p>
  <p> After a long beat...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We will be in orbit around your<br>
    planet for at least two days...<br>
    it may be some time before we<br>
    return again. I would be<br>
    favorably disposed to grant a<br>
    leave should you request one.</p>
  <p> Worf thinks about this... he's getting closer to doing<br>
    just that.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Bridge to Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (softly)<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (hits communicator)<br>
    Go ahead, Number One.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - 4/8/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    We've been intercepted by the<br>
    Klingon vessel Bortas. They claim<br>
    to be our escort.</p>
  <p> Picard gives Worf a puzzled look.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No escort was scheduled.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>3 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE &amp; KLINGON CRUISER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise and a Klingon attack cruiser running<br>
    side by side on impulse power.</p>
  <p>4 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> RIKER and DATA at their positions. Picard ENTERS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    The Bortas is standing by,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p>5 INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> GOWRON appears on the viewscreen, sitting in his ready<br>
    room. Picard and Riker are surprised.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Gowron... this is an unexpected<br>
    pleasure.</p>
  <p> Gowron's attitude is urgent... no time for<br>
    pleasantries.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    I must speak with you, Picard.<br>
    We have to move quickly if we are<br>
    to be successful.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Successful?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - 4/8/91 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Yes.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    In preventing a Klingon civil war.</p>
  <p> On Picard's reaction...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

    END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/9/91 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> <br>
    ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>6 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard is listening to Gowron. Gowron moves about the<br>
    room... restless... a man being kept from what is<br>
    rightfully his.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    The family of Duras is massing<br>
    support... they have many allies<br>
    on the Council...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But Duras died in disgrace. By<br>
    Klingon tradition, his family<br>
    should share in that disgrace.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Their corruption has poisoned the<br>
    Empire. Honor will soon have<br>
    no meaning.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Who speaks for his family now?</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Lursa and B'Etor... the sisters<br>
    of Duras.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And they would claim leadership<br>
    of the Council?</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (shakes his head)<br>
    Women may not serve on the<br>
    Council...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then how... ?</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    I don't know. But they are<br>
    plotting something. They have<br>
    secured the loyalty of at least<br>
    three fleet commanders.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Their followers do not care about<br>
    Duras' crimes. Lursa and B'etor<br>
    are feared... and fear is power.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/10/91 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I fail to see what I can do to<br>
    assist...</p>
  <p> Gowron moves to Picard...</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    You were first chosen as arbiter<br>
    of succession because no Klingon<br>
    could be trusted. You accepted<br>
    this duty... and you must see it<br>
    through to the end. You must<br>
    ensure my installation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am prepared to report to the<br>
    Council that only you have<br>
    completed the rite of<br>
    succession...</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Not enough. Duras was a Romulan<br>
    collaborator. You must declare<br>
    his family ineligible to ever<br>
    again sit on the ruling Council.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That... is beyond my purview.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    You will not support me?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will not step outside the<br>
    traditional role of the arbiter.</p>
  <p> Gowron sighs, hopes dashed.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    And if they attempt to block my<br>
    installation?</p>
  <p> Picard stands and goes to him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can only assure you that I will<br>
    deal with any challenge according<br>
    to Klingon law.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    I fear that will not be enough.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/9/91 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard has made his position clear, has nothing more to<br>
    offer. Gowron looks at him for a beat... gives a curt<br>
    nod of understanding, then they both EXIT to...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/9/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>7 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Picard and Gowron ENTER from the observation lounge.<br>
    Riker, Worf, and DATA at their positions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, please escort our<br>
    guest to the transporter room.</p>
  <p> Gowron throws Worf a quick look of disgust, and they<br>
    EXIT to the turbolift. Picard sits in command with a<br>
    thoughtful look on his face. After a beat...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, begin monitoring<br>
    Romulan activity along the Neutral<br>
    Zone. Have the outpost stations<br>
    there start sending us their<br>
    tactical reports.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker is a little surprised... he gives Picard a<br>
    questioning look.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Duras family is preparing to<br>
    move against Gowron.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Backed by Romulans?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know. But there's too<br>
    much history between the Duras<br>
    (note: plural) and the Romulans<br>
    to discount the possibility.</p>
  <p> Riker nods agreement.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>7A INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Worf and Gowron ENTER. Gowron is studiously avoiding<br>
    looking at Worf. As Gowron moves toward the platform,<br>
    Worf finally decides to take the plunge.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Technician)<br>
    Dismissed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/9/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>7A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN EXITS. Gowron looks at Worf<br>
    in mild surprise.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I would speak with you.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    I do not hear the words of a<br>
    traitor.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts to the word traitor... he takes a step<br>
    toward Gowron and says the words he's been holding back<br>
    for a long time.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (slow and clear)<br>
    I am not a traitor.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    You admitted your guilt before<br>
    the Council.</p>
  <p> Worf's expression hardens... he's not going to back<br>
    down this time.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I accepted discommendation to<br>
    protect the Empire.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Protect it? How?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It was Duras' father who betrayed<br>
    our people to the Romulans at<br>
    Khitomer. Not mine.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    Duras. There is proof of this?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There is.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Why would you accept dishonor<br>
    to protect Duras?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/9/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>7A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (bitter)<br>
    His family was too powerful. To<br>
    expose him would have split the<br>
    Empire. Instead, the Council<br>
    chose to blame my father.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    The Council knew?</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I believe you are a man of honor,<br>
    Gowron.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I ask you to restore my family<br>
    name.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (with sympathy)<br>
    Worf, you killed Duras. I<br>
    consider that no small favor.<br>
    But what you ask is impossible.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But after your Installation...</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    The grasp of Duras reaches out<br>
    from the grave. Much of the<br>
    Council is still loyal to his<br>
    family. I must have the<br>
    Council's support to survive.<br>
    I cannot expose their treachery.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at Gowron, perhaps a man of honor but<br>
    definitely a political animal most interested in his<br>
    own survival. Gowron is even a little ashamed of<br>
    himself, but this is the reality.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    You chose to accept this disgrace<br>
    for the good of the Empire. Now,<br>
    you must live with your decision<br>
    like a Klingon.</p>
  <p> A beat on Worf's cold stare.</p>

    MOVE TO REVEAL Worf checking his weapon on the phaser<br>
    range. His expression is tense... tightly controlled.<br>
    From o.s. we hear the SOUND OF DOORS OPENING and<br>
    someone entering the range. Worf looks up in surprise<br>
    to see...</p>
  <p>11 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> GUINAN steps into the small circle of light carrying<br>
    a phaser.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Guinan?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Hi. Ten Forward's been pretty<br>
    quiet today... I thought I'd get<br>
    in a little target practice. Mind<br>
    if I join you?</p>
  <p> Worf didn't expect this at all... doesn't know what to<br>
    say. Guinan finishes checking out her phaser.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You... practice?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Sure. I like to keep my eye<br>
    sharp.</p>

    I... practice at... level<br>
    fourteen.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (smiles, with humor)<br>
    That's okay. I can go back to<br>
    that level for a while.</p>
  <p> Worf doesn't react to her joke.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You know, I have a bet with the<br>
    captain that I can make you smile<br>
    before you make lieutenant<br>
    commander.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Not a good bet today.</p>
  <p> She makes room for him in the circle. Worf hesitates<br>
    for another moment... then steps in. He quickly checks<br>
    his phaser.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Ready?<br>
    (off his nod)<br>
    Computer, level fourteen... begin<br>
    program.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Program initiated.</p>
  <p> Worf and Guinan hold their weapons at the ready. Two<br>
    TARGETS streak by and they quickly FIRE together...<br>
    both targets are HIT.</p>
  <p> They continue to fire in turn at targets as they<br>
    appear...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I'm sure I heard you laugh<br>
    once... I liked it...</p>
  <p> Guinan blasts three targets in a row.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Klingons don't laugh.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/16/91 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Not true. Not true at all. You<br>
    may not laugh. But believe me,<br>
    I've heard some Klingon belly<br>
    laughs that could shake a room.</p>
  <p> Worf grunts, hits a low target.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Your son laughs and he's Klingon.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He's a child. And part human.</p>
  <p> Worf blasts two targets.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Oh, that's right and you're not.<br>
    You're all Klingon. Except you<br>
    don't laugh.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I don't laugh because I don't feel<br>
    like laughing.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    But other Klingons feel like<br>
    laughing. What does that say<br>
    about you... ?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (gritting his teeth,<br>
    frustrated)<br>
    Perhaps it says... I do not feel<br>
    like other Klingons.</p>

    Hey, don't feel bad... I was<br>
    doing this years before you were<br>
    born.</p>
  <p> Worf nods to her with new respect.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    How is he, by the way? Your son.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He is having some... difficulties<br>
    adjusting to life on Earth.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Must be tough for a little guy<br>
    like that... living with humans,<br>
    being Klingon... it has to get<br>
    confusing sometimes...</p>
  <p> Worf gives her a look... who is she talking about...<br>
    Alexander, or him?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It will not be easy for him...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    No, it won't. But the time will<br>
    come when he'll have to find out<br>
    what it really means to be<br>
    Klingon...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Just as the time has come now for<br>
    you, Worf.</p>
  <p> He looks at her... she EXITS. Move in on him a<br>

    there on his face, almost, not quite, is the vaguest<br>
    hint of a determined smile.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>

  <p> Picard is pleased at Worf's decision. He stands.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (formally)<br>
    Mister Worf... request granted.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

  <p> Picard nods. Worf moves to leave.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf...<br>
    (Worf pauses)<br>

  <p> Worf stands a little taller, squares his shoulders at<br>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>13 EXT. SPACE - BIRD OF PREY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship in orbit around the Klingon Home World.</p>
  <p> WORF (V.O.)<br>
    Lieutenant Worf, personal log,<br>
    stardate 44996.1. I have located<br>
    the Klingon ship on which my<br>
    brother Kurn serves as captain<br>
    and have arranged to join him.</p>
  <p>14 INT. BIRD OF PREY - READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Unlike its counterpart on the Enterprise, this room is<br>
    designed to emphasize the prestige and prowess of the<br>
    ship's captain. Weapons and trophies are boldly<br>
    displayed on the wall and the captain's chair is bigger<br>
    and higher than the other three seats. There is also<br>
    a desk visible. KURN is sitting in the imposing<br>
    captain's chair. The doors OPEN and WORF ENTERS. Kurn<br>
    gets to his feet instantly... he's glad to see Worf.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    It has been too long, my brother.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (agrees)<br>
    Too long.</p>
  <p> A silent moment...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There is much to discuss. I have<br>
    asked Gowron to restore our family<br>
    honor. He has refused.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    No matter. Gowron will not live<br>
    to see the day he leads the<br>
    Council...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What do you mean?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/9/91 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    He stands alone, surrounded by<br>
    his enemies. Lursa and B-Etor<br>
    will have him killed... and if<br>
    they don't, I will.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You will... ?</p>
  <p> Kurn feels passionately about this... he's deeply<br>
    offended by what's happened to his people and is<br>
    determined to change it.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Gowron is weak... and the family<br>
    of Duras must never be allowed<br>
    to lead the Council. All of our<br>
    leaders... have failed us. They<br>
    no longer deserve our loyalty.<br>
    (beat, then quieter)<br>
    It is time to sweep away the old<br>
    Council... and put a new one in<br>
    its place.</p>
  <p> Worf is surprised. This particular option had not<br>
    occurred to him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    How could this be done?</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    I already have the support of four<br>
    squadron commanders in strategic<br>
    sectors. When the time comes,<br>
    they will follow me.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Join us, Worf... we will usher<br>
    in a new era, and regain our<br>
    family name.</p>
  <p> Worf turns away... thinks this over carefully... then<br>
    shakes his head and turns back. There can be only one<br>
    answer.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/9/91 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Gowron has completed the rite of<br>
    succession... it is our duty to<br>
    support him.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (terse)<br>
    Gowron spits in your face when<br>
    you ask him to give back what is<br>
    rightfully ours... and you would<br>
    support him?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We cannot regain honor by acting<br>
    dishonorably.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (terse)<br>
    I will not support Gowron.</p>
  <p> A key moment... Worf moves closer to Kurn and they both<br>
    tense.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (low, deadly)<br>
    I am the elder brother, Kurn...<br>
    I speak for our family.</p>
  <p> They glare at each other for a long tense beat... it's<br>
    tough, but Kurn finally backs off... he drops his eyes<br>
    in acquiescence. Worf is now firmly in command.</p>
  <p> His attitude loosens slightly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We will back Gowron.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But not now. Not yet. We will<br>
    wait. Until Gowron feels the<br>
    grasp of his enemies around his<br>
    throat. Then we will offer him<br>
    our support. And the price will<br>
    be the restoration of our family<br>
    name.</p>
  <p> Kurn takes a beat to adjust his thinking to this new<br>
    plan... he finally is able to let go of his resentment<br>
    and concentrate on the matter at hand.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/11/91 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    It will be difficult to convince<br>
    my allies to back Gowron.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I will try. I must go to the<br>
    Mempa sector and meet with the<br>
    other squadron commanders.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Contact me when you have gained<br>
    their support.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Then I will be ready for Gowron.</p>
  <p> On Worf's determined expression...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>

  <p> The Klingon capitol, with Great Hall in view.</p>
  <p>16 INT. GREAT HALL</p>
  <p> As seen in &quot;Sins of the Father.&quot; THE COUNCIL MEMBERS<br>
    are standing on either side of the leader's chair, which<br>
    is empty except for the CEREMONIAL CLOAK OF K'MPEC.<br>
    The Council Members are all male, predominantly older,<br>
    with one or two young upstarts among them. There are<br>
    TWO GUARDS in the room, standing watch at strategic<br>
    points. Gowron and ONE AIDE stand nearby.</p>
  <p> K'TAL<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    naDev ghoS! (Come here!)</p>
  <p> Picard steps forward</p>
  <p> K'TAL<br>
    Have you reached a decision<br>
    regarding the succession of<br>
    power?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/10/91 - ACT TWO 19A.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'TAL now moves forward from the Council. K'Tal is<br>
    an older member of the Council. He follows neither<br>
    Gowron nor the sisters... he serves the Empire... a<br>
    man who has been on the Council longer than anyone<br>
    else and will probably still be here when the others<br>
    are all gone. He nods to Picard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/9/91 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'TAL<br>
    (casual)<br>
    Your Klingon is flawless, Picard.<br>
    Not even a trace of a human<br>
    accent. The Council thanks you<br>
    for your service to the Empire.</p>
  <p> Picard bows to the Council.</p>
  <p> K'TAL<br>
    (booming voice)<br>
    Gowron, son of M'Rel, hakt'em.</p>
  <p> Gowron steps forward... gives all the Councilors a hard<br>
    look. Most of them glare back at him, unhappy to be<br>
    admitting Gowron to their ranks.</p>
  <p> K'TAL<br>
    (ritually)<br>
    The arbiter confirms that you<br>
    have completed the rite of<br>
    succession. Your enemies have<br>
    been destroyed. You stand alone.<br>
    Do you wish to claim leadership<br>
    of the Council?</p>
  <p> He stands directly before Gowron as Picard takes the<br>
    cloak from the empty chair and holds it before Gowron.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    I wish it.</p>
  <p> K'TAL<br>
    (routine, to the room)<br>
    Are there no other challengers?</p>
  <p> TORAL (o.s.)<br>
    There is one.</p>
  <p>17 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Everyone turns to see TORAL, a Klingon boy (16-18),<br>
    ENTER. He is a boy sent to do a man's job, and<br>
    consequently he has all the arrogance and false bravado<br>
    of youth instead of the confidence and strength of<br>
    maturity.</p>
  <p> TORAL<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I will challenge him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/11/91 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (incensed)<br>
    An arrogant child!</p>
  <p> Gowron reaches for his weapon, but K'Tal smoothly<br>
    restrains him.</p>
  <p> K'TAL<br>
    (to Toral)<br>
    Who are you?</p>
  <p> TORAL<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I am Toral... son of Duras.</p>
  <p> Reactions. Gasps. Hubub. Picard's eyes narrow.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Duras had no son!</p>
  <p> LURSA and B'ETOR now ENTER the hall.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    But he did...</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    So, this is your doing...</p>
  <p> Lursa is older, middle-aged for a Klingon... she's seen<br>
    quite a few battles in her day, political and<br>
    otherwise. B'Etor is several years younger, and more<br>
    volatile than her sister. They walk with assurance to<br>
    stand before the Council. The Council Members exchange<br>
    nervous glances... a little afraid of these women.<br>
    B'Etor moves to stand beside Toral. She's not afraid<br>
    of Gowron and her presence shores up Toral a little.</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    (ignoring Gowron)<br>
    We wish to address the Council.</p>
  <p> K'TAL<br>
    Lursa, B'Etor, come forward.</p>

  <p> LURSA<br>
    Members of the High Council, it<br>
    is a day of great rejoicing for<br>
    the family of Duras and the<br>
    Klingon Empire. We have<br>
    discovered that our brother did<br>
    indeed have a son and heir.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    This is an outrage! Duras had<br>
    no mate. Where did you find him,<br>
    Lursa? In a harlot's bed<br>
    chamber?</p>
  <p> TORAL<br>
    I will personally cut your tongue<br>
    out, Yintagh!</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Impudent wretch.</p>
  <p> Both are restrained. The sisters grin. They exchange<br>
    a glance with Picard.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    A simple genetic scan will prove<br>
    his bloodline is valid.</p>

  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (to the council)<br>
    The illegitimate son of Duras<br>
    cannot rule the High Council.</p>
  <p> K'TAL<br>
    The Council will decide whether<br>
    to accept the challenge of Toral,<br>
    alleged son of Duras. In favor?</p>
  <p> From left to right, one by one the members outstretch<br>
    their right fist and grasp the right elbow with their<br>
    left hand, signifying yes. Only K'tal and one other<br>
    do not follow.</p>
  <p> K'TAL<br>
    Opposed.</p>
  <p> One arm goes out. K'tal doesn't vote again.</p>
  <p> K'TAL<br>
    The challenge is accepted.</p>
  <p> He turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> K'TAL<br>
    The arbiter will consider its<br>
    validity.<br>

    part of the city.</p>
  <p>19 INT. DURAS FAMILY HOME</p>
  <p> The Klingon equivalent to the living room in a<br>
    senator's house. There is a couch, a couple chairs, a<br>
    low table, and some banners on the walls. It's dark...<br>
    moody. Lursa and B'Etor are talking to someone o.s.<br>
    while Toral sulks on the couch.</p>

  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    Our allies on the Council backed<br>

  <p> MOVAR (o.s.)<br>
    Excellent. Everything is<br>
    proceeding as scheduled.</p>
  <p> MOVE TO reveal MOVAR, a Romulan general. Movar is<br>
    smooth, polished... a political general rather than<br>
    a combat veteran. There is ANOTHER FIGURE sitting in<br>
    the darkness near Movar who might be a woman, but we're<br>
    not sure yet.</p>
  <p> MOVAR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It will make matters simpler if<br>
    the captain is cooperative... but<br>
    we are prepared to move in any<br>
    case.</p>
  <p> TORAL<br>
    (petulantly)<br>
    Why not just kill Picard?</p>
  <p> B'Etor cuffs him roughly... it's clear that she and<br>
    her sister are the real powers here. Toral shrinks<br>
    from the reproof.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    (angry)<br>
    Fool! Do we want the Federation<br>
    as our enemy?</p>
  <p> TORAL<br>
    (abashed)<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> The Woman in shadow doesn't have to raise her voice<br>

    There is something deadly in her calm voice and assured<br>

  <p> KURN<br>
    I have met with the other squadron<br>

  <p> Worf nods soberly... the odds against them are still<br>

    Gowron is nearly out of options.<br>
    Soon he will have no choice...</p>
  <p> Kurn nods in agreement.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    I will soon return to the Home<br>
    World. We shall meet then.</p>
  <p> Worf acknowledges as the monitor shuts off. He nods,<br>
    satisfied, EXITS.</p>

    Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

    Everything we have on the<br>
    Khitomer massacre.</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS from the turbolift and moves toward his<br>
    ready room, but stops as he sees Worf. He's surprised<br>
    to see Worf, and he becomes uncomfortable as he<br>
    realizes what they're talking about.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I can provide you with our<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Mister Worf... have you cancelled<br>
    your leave?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant... join me in my ready<br>
    room.</p>
  <p> Picard and Worf EXIT to...</p>
  <p>22 INT. READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Picard and Worf ENTER. Picard takes a minute to<br>
    compose his thoughts.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/9/91 - ACT THREE 27.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are planning to use our files<br>
    on the Khitomer massacre as<br>
    evidence against Duras' father?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf... do you not see an<br>
    inherent conflict of interest...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, these records can help me<br>
    prove that my father was falsely<br>
    accused of treason.</p>
  <p> Picard is caught between his desire to help Worf and<br>
    his responsibilities as captain. He struggles to<br>
    define the limitations both for himself and for Worf.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are using your position as<br>
    a Starfleet officer to affect<br>
    political change on your<br>
    planet... there could not be a<br>
    worse compromise of our<br>
    fundamental principles...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain... you urged me to fight<br>
    this battle...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (sighs, frustrated)<br>
    Yes, I know. I understand your<br>
    motives, and you know I support<br>
    your goals, but...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Do not tie my hands now... I<br>
    must be able to prove my father's<br>
    innocence. The Federation records<br>
    will do that.</p>
  <p> Picard knows he needs them. He wants to help. What<br>
    the hell can he do? He shakes his head.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf... Mister Worf...<br>
    (beat, sighs)<br>
    Mister Worf...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/9/91 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> His tone gets more intimate. Quite unlike Picard, the<br>
    words rather spill out as he exposes his own feelings,<br>
    his own frustrations to the junior officer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Here I am lecturing you on a<br>
    conflict of interest while I'm<br>
    desperately trying to avoid one<br>
    of my own. Do you think I wish<br>
    to allow the Duras family to<br>
    solidify their hold on the<br>
    Council? Do you think I cannot<br>
    see the implications for the<br>
    Federation? And good Lord, Duras<br>
    tried to have me killed!<br>
    (beat)<br>
    All of my instincts... my<br>
    training... my very being as a<br>
    Starfleet officer are at odds with<br>
    my responsibilities as arbiter<br>
    for the Klingon High Council.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We walk the same tightrope between<br>
    two worlds... you and I. We must<br>
    try our very best to keep those<br>
    worlds clearly separate... or we<br>
    shall certainly fall.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As far as these records from<br>
    Khitomer are concerned...</p>
  <p> Picard pauses for a beat. He really wants to help<br>
    Worf... he struggles with his conscience... finally<br>
    sees a way to give Worf what he wants... but Picard is<br>
    pushing himself to the absolute limit... this is as<br>
    far as he can go.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I will make the Federation<br>
    records on the Khitomer massacre<br>
    available... to anyone who wants<br>
    them... the High Council, the<br>
    Duras family... anyone.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (very pleased)<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, this is as far as<br>
    I can go.</p>
  <p> Worf acknowledges, EXITS. Picard sits down... frowns,<br>
    unhappy with just about everything.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Yes, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    There's a message coming in for<br>
    you from the surface. It's coded<br>
    personal.</p>
  <p> Picard's a little surprised.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Send it through.</p>
  <p> He turns to the computer terminal on his desk... begins<br>
    reading the message... he's very surprised at the<br>
    information on the screen. On Picard's puzzled<br>
    expression...</p>

  <p>24 INT. DURAS FAMILY HOME</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS. Lursa and B'Etor are waiting for him.<br>
    The low table is set with both Klingon and Human<br>
    drinks. Their attitudes are relaxed... friendly.</p>
  <p> While Lursa maintains a cool diplomatic air, B'Etor's<br>
    attitude is more physical... seductive. Picard is<br>
    the consummate diplomat as always, but he's wary of<br>
    these two women.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/9/91 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    Welcome, Captain.</p>
  <p> She indicates the couch and everyone sits.</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    Something to drink? Tea... Earl<br>
    Grey, perhaps?</p>
  <p> Picard is a little intrigued... how did she know that<br>
    particular detail? He tries not to let his surprise<br>
    show.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes... thank you.</p>
  <p> B'Etor pours him a cup of tea. Lursa and B'Etor drink<br>
    a more vile-looking Klingon concoction. Picard is<br>
    willing to listen to them... but this is like having<br>
    tea with the Borgias.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    You come... alone and unarmed...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nothing would be served by killing<br>
    the arbiter before his decision.</p>
  <p> B'Etor touches his leg.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    Nevertheless, a brave act,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    (chiding)<br>
    B'Etor...</p>
  <p> B'Etor removes her hand although she's anything but<br>
    abashed.</p>
  <p> Picard is not blind to her advances... they probably<br>
    disturb him more than anything else in this scene --<br>
    for he's more than able to play the political game,<br>
    but a hot Klingon woman may even be beyond the Great<br>
    Picard. Throughout, he tries to concentrate on Lursa.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/16/91 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your invitation was... unexpected.</p>
  <p> B'Etor moves a little closer to him... her eyes and<br>
    voice hint at pleasures other than tea.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    We should have extended it much<br>
    sooner.</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    We don't want you to judge us by<br>
    your experience with our brother.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    Duras was a fool.</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    He deserved to die.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    Forget him. We have.</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    We do not wish to be your enemy.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    Quite the opposite.</p>
  <p> She has moved behind him... puts her hands on his<br>
    shoulders... she's a very tactile Klingon.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That... pleases me.</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    Have you made a decision regarding<br>
    Toral's challenge?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am pursuing it with all due<br>
    vigilance.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    Let me heat your tea.</p>
  <p> She comes around to pour.</p>

  <p>24 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    Toral has the bloodline to lead<br>
    the Empire into the next century.<br>
    He has the support of the people.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The remaining issue then is to<br>
    see if he has the support of the<br>
    law.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    But he must. Surely, you can see<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a moment and a sip of tea...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll tell you what I see. If I<br>
    find Toral's challenge valid, the<br>
    two of you will very quickly gain<br>
    control of the Council... and<br>
    Gowron will be found dead shortly<br>
    thereafter. If I reject Toral's<br>
    challenge, you will accuse me of<br>
    doing it only to serve Federation<br>
    interests. It will give you a<br>
    rallying cry to declare war and<br>
    overthrow Gowron.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/10/91 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    You see very clearly, Captain.<br>
    But one thing is missing.<br>
    If you rule against us and we are<br>
    victorious in a war against<br>
    Gowron...</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    ... which we would be...</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    ... it would mean the end of the<br>
    alliance with the Federation.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    (sympathetically)<br>
    And we'd hate to see that happen<br>
    as much as you would.</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    This is not a threat, Captain.<br>
    Just an unfortunate truth.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    So why be our enemy, when you can<br>
    be our friend?</p>
  <p> Her hand his back on his knee. He studies both women.<br>

  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'TAL<br>
    What is your decision?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    K'tal, this Council knows the law<br>
    of heredity well. G'now juk Hol<br>
    pajhard. A son will share in<br>
    the honors or crimes of his<br>
    father. Toral is Duras' son...<br>
    that has been established by the<br>
    genetic scan. And it is<br>
    heartwarming to see him embraced<br>
    by the family of Duras... for they<br>
    are an old and noble family.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But with due respect to the<br>
    traditions and laws of this High<br>
    Council, there is no basis for<br>
    accepting a petition for<br>
    leadership from a boy who has<br>
    fought no battles, shed no blood<br>
    for his people, earned no honor<br>
    for himself. Perhaps some day<br>
    he shall. But not now.</p>
  <p> There are murmurs and reactions from everyone. Picard<br>
    knows what the reaction to his decision will be...<br>
    knows the cost... but also knows there is no other<br>
    way.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Duras... is dead. His claim to<br>
    the leadership died with him.<br>
    Gowron will lead the Council.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    The arbiter has ruled. There<br>
    are no more challengers.</p>
  <p> Lursa looks at Toral who steps forward... yells a<br>
    little too loudly---</p>
  <p> TORAL<br>
    Does the Federation dictate<br>
    Klingon destiny or do we? Follow<br>
    me. And I will show you honor.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Follow him and you reject all<br>
    Klingon law...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/10/91 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>27A ON COUNCIL MEMBERS</p>
  <p> One by one, they step down from the dais and stand<br>
    behind Toral until only K'tal and the other Councilor<br>
    (who voted against him) are left.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Can you not see what you are<br>
    doing... are you blind to what<br>
    they represent... are there so<br>
    few noble Klingons left?</p>
  <p>27B ON LURSA &amp; PICARD</p>
  <p> Lursa and B'Etor give Picard a final look: &quot;see, I've<br>
    still won.&quot;</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Then go... your blood will paint<br>
    the way to the future.</p>
  <p> Toral moves to Picard, looks up at him, with all the<br>
    bravado he can muster...</p>
  <p> TORAL<br>

  <p>29 INT. KLINGON CRUISER - READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Similar to the ready room on Kurn's ship, but with a<br>
    few more symbols of Gowron's higher rank. Gowron is<br>
    sitting in the captain's chair. The doors OPEN and<br>
    Worf ENTERS. Gowron glares at him... he's a man in a<br>
    tight spot and this had better be good.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (brusque)<br>
    Your message said it was urgent.<br>
    What do you want?</p>
  <p> Worf is not intimidated by the glowering visage of<br>
    Gowron. He is blunt and to the point.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Your forces are weak, Gowron...<br>
    you will need help to fight the<br>
    family of Duras.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (dismissive)<br>
    From one dishonored Klingon...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I offer you four Klingon<br>
    squadrons.</p>
  <p> Gowron has to take that seriously. He's suspicious,<br>
    but begins to look at Worf a little differently.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Why would they follow you... a<br>

    a ray of hope in his position, but he's still cautious.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Kurn will follow me? He has<br>
    opposed me in the past.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am the elder brother... he will<br>
    do as I say.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    What is it you want in return?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You know my price.</p>
  <p> Gowron does know his price... but he's not ready to<br>
    commit himself yet.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    The return of your honor. For<br>
    the support of four squadrons... ?<br>
    No, that will not be enough.<br>
    The Duras family controls most<br>
    of the fleet.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We must have Federation help.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They will not intervene.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Perhaps not yet... but Starfleet<br>
    Command will listen to Picard...<br>
    and Picard listens to you.</p>
  <p> Worf is disturbed by the direction this is going.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I can ask nothing more of him in<br>
    this matter.</p>
  <p> Gowron doesn't like it when people say no to him. He<br>
    confronts Worf squarely.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    What?</p>

    restoration of your family<br>
    honor... and now you hide behind<br>
    Human excuses!</p>
  <p> A beat as Gowron gets right up into his face. Gowron's<br>
    voice becomes quieter... less harsh... but his eyes<br>
    bore straight into Worf's... and his words knife to<br>
    the very heart of Worf's internal struggle.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What are you, Worf? Do you<br>
    tremble and quake with fear at<br>
    the approach of combat... hoping<br>
    to talk your way out of a fight...<br>
    like a Human... or do you hear<br>
    the cry of the warrior... calling<br>
    you to battle... calling you to<br>
    glory... like a Klingon?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Are you one of us?</p>
  <p> This is the question which has haunted Worf all his<br>
    life... he searches for the answer within... but knows<br>

    no. Gowron waits for a reply...</p>

  <p> K'TAL<br>

    Gowron, son of M'Rel, hakt'em.<br>
    The arbiter confirms that you<br>

    been destroyed. You stand alone.<br>

  <p> Picard, Riker, Gowron, and Worf.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    The Duras family is gathering a<br>
    large force near Beta Thoridar.<br>
    As per the terms of the Treaty<br>
    of Alliance, I now formally<br>
    request your assistance in<br>
    fighting these enemies of the<br>
    Empire.</p>
  <p> Picard had been expecting this... he knows this will be<br>
    difficult.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    These... enemies are Klingons.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    By right and tradition, I am now<br>
    the sole leader... all who oppose<br>
    me... are traitors.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand your position.<br>
    However, you must be aware that<br>
    the Federation will not become<br>
    involved in what is, by<br>
    definition, an internal Klingon<br>
    matter.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    You arbitrated the rite of<br>
    succession, you are already<br>
    involved!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And my duties in that regard are<br>
    finished.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain... we must intervene.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/9/91 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker are surprised. Worf forges ahead.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The Duras family is corrupt and<br>
    hungry for power... with no sense<br>
    of honor or loyalty. They<br>
    represent a grave threat to the<br>
    security of the Federation.<br>
    (beat, then quieter,<br>
    a direct appeal)<br>
    Captain, you and I know that they<br>
    have conspired with Romulans in<br>
    the past. If they should be the<br>
    victors in this war, they will<br>
    surely form a new Klingon/Romulan<br>
    alliance. That would represent<br>
    a fundamental shift of power in<br>
    this quadrant.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Starfleet must support Gowron...<br>
    it is in the interests of both<br>
    the Federation and the Empire.<br>
    I beg you to support us in our<br>
    cause.</p>
  <p> Picard is very disturbed by this appeal... Worf seems<br>
    unaware of the fact that he's just stepped across the<br>
    line... &quot;support us in our cause.&quot; Picard looks Worf squarely in 
    the eye.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (slow and firm)<br>
    Mister Worf... non-interference<br>
    in the internal affairs of other<br>
    cultures is one of the guiding<br>
    principles of the Federation...<br>
    and as Starfleet officers, we have<br>
    all sworn an oath to uphold that<br>
    principle regardless of personal<br>
    feeling.<br>
    (to Gowron)<br>
    I am sorry... but I must refuse<br>
    your request.</p>
  <p> Gowron is not happy with this answer... but bickering<br>
    would be beneath the dignity of the Leader of the<br>
    Empire. Gowron stands... glares at Picard... then<br>
    heads for the door. Worf moves to follow him...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/8/91 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Worf stops, as does Gowron.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm afraid that I must now recall<br>
    you to duty. The Enterprise will<br>
    be leaving this sector<br>
    immediately.</p>
  <p> A difficult moment for Worf. He glances at Gowron.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain... I respectfully request<br>
    that I be allowed to take an<br>
    extended leave of absence.</p>
  <p> Picard stands... he understands the conflict within<br>
    Worf, but Picard has gone as far as he can already.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant, your responsibilities<br>
    as a Starfleet officer are<br>
    incompatible with remaining aboard<br>
    a Klingon ship during a time of<br>
    war.</p>
  <p> Worf again looks between Gowron and Picard. They<br>
    represent the two roads now before him... the conflict<br>
    which has torn him for his entire life has now come to<br>
    a head... where does his duty lie?... is he Klingon?...<br>
    is he Human?... what path should he follow?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> There is no room for Picard to yield. Worf must<br>
    choose.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are ordered to return to duty<br>
    immediately.</p>
  <p> A final beat as Worf finally comes to a fateful<br>
    decision...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Then... I must resign my<br>
    commission as a Starfleet officer.</p>
  <p> A moment as the words sink in... Worf slowly takes the<br>
    combadge from his chest and sets it on the table. He<br>
    turns to Gowron, who nods approval.</p>

    home for four years... Worf turns... sees his<br>

    about to sail aboard different ships.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Am I intruding?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> A silent moment as Picard notices the clothes... Worf<br>
    is a little uncomfortable, almost wants to apologize<br>
    for being out of uniform... but that wouldn't be<br>
    appropriate.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/9/91 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> Another silent beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you certain you've made the<br>
    right decision, Worf?</p>
  <p> Worf clearly isn't sure... but it's too late for that.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Worf struggles for a moment... finally opens up a<br>
    little... shares the real reasons underlying his<br>
    decision.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I was rescued from Khitomer by<br>
    humans... raised and... loved by<br>
    human parents. I have lived among<br>
    humans for most of my life...<br>
    fought at their sides.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I was born Klingon. My heart<br>
    is of that world. I do hear the<br>
    cry of the warrior...<br>
    (note of finality)<br>
    I belong with my people.</p>
  <p> Picard considers that for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Being the only Klingon ever to<br>
    serve in Starfleet... gave you<br>
    a singular distinction.<br>

  <p>54 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    But I always felt that the most<br>
    unique thing about you was<br>
    your... humanity.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Compassion... generosity...<br>
    fairness... You took some of the<br>
    best qualities of humanity and<br>
    made them part of you. The<br>
    result... was a man I was proud<br>
    to call one of my officers.</p>
  <p> A shared moment between the two men. After a beat...<br>
    Picard breaks the moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (re: things on bed)<br>
    I'll have your belongings<br>
    transported to the Bortas.</p>
  <p> There is more than just acknowledgement of this simple<br>
    act in Worf's response... he's also thanking Picard<br>
    for a great many things.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Thank you...</p>
  <p> Picard understands the subtext... after a beat, Worf<br>
    glances around the room one last time then heads for<br>

  <p> Revealing that the long, straight section of corridor<br>
    leading from the turbolift to the transporter room is<br>
    lined with CREWMEMBERS standing at parade rest. Picard<br>
    is not surprised to see them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption&quot; - REV. 4/8/91 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>56 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The Crewmembers all snap to attention. Worf realizes<br>
    that this is meant for him... he struggles to hide the<br>
    swell of emotion that begins to build within him.<br>
    Picard looks at him: &quot;They're waiting... &quot; Worf squares<br>
    his shoulders and proudly walks between the long line<br>
    of his shipmates to the transporter room, Picard at his<br>
    side.</p>
  <p>57 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Worf and Picard ENTER through the open doors. At the<br>
    end of the line are (in ascending order of rank)<br>
    GEORDI, Data, TROI, BEVERLY, and Riker. Worf doesn't<br>
    know what to say to these people... how to respond.<br>
    They stand there silently... their respect and<br>
    affection for their friend is clear... no words are<br>
    necessary. Picard goes to the head of the line... Worf<br>
    steps on the stage.</p>
  <p>58 ON PICARD AND WORF</p>
  <p> After a beat...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Permission to leave the ship, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Permission granted.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Qapla'</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Good-bye.</p>
  <p> Picard nods to the TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN.</p>
  <p>59 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Worf DEMATERIALIZES. A silent beat...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Dismissed.</p>
  <p> Everyone EXITS except Picard. On his reaction...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>

  <p>60 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE &amp; KLINGON CRUISER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise leaves and the Bortas remains in<br>
    orbit.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>61 INT. DURAS FAMILY HOME</p>
  <p> Movar is here, along with Lursa, B'Etor, and Toral.<br>
    The Mysterious Woman heard from earlier is sitting in<br>
    a chair with her back to us. Toral paces while the<br>
    women study something on a monitor. The door OPENS<br>
    and a ROMULAN CREWMEMBER ENTERS, carrying a PADD. The<br>
    Crewmember hands the PADD to Movar, then EXITS. Movar<br>
    studies it for a moment.</p>
  <p> MOVAR<br>
    Picard has rejected Gowron's plea<br>
    for help.<br>
    (looks up)<br>
    The Enterprise has left orbit.</p>
  <p> Lursa and B'Etor exchange a glance... good news.</p>
  <p> TORAL<br>
    (exultant)<br>
    Coward! He didn't have the<br>
    courage to face us. The<br>
    Federation is---</p>
  <p> The Woman cuts him off without raising her voice.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    Celebrate later, Toral.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We should not discount Jean-Luc<br>
    Picard yet. He is human...</p>
  <p>62 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> The Woman turns around in her chair so that her<br>
    features become apparent for the first time. We're<br>
    shocked as we see that she's Human... with blonde<br>
    hair... and that she bears a striking resemblance to<br>
    the late Tasha Yar.</p>

  <p> WOMAN<br>
