    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship orbits a small, orange hued planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, stardate 44741.9.<br>
    We have arrived at Tagus Three<br>
    where the Enterprise is to serve<br>
    as host of the Federation<br>
    Archeology Council's annual<br>
    symposium.</p>
  <p>2 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> PICARD, intensely studying his monitor screen.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    I look forward to giving<br>
    tomorrow's keynote address with<br>
    great anticipation.</p>
  <p> The DOOR CHIME SOUNDS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> TROI ENTERS. Picard barely glances up from the<br>
    monitor. Troi smiles at Picard's preoccupation.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I thought you'd want to know,<br>
    Captain, the Council members have<br>
    all been beamed aboard and<br>
    assigned quarters.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Excellent.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - REV. 2/1/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (a hint)<br>
    It really is quite late, Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard motions her over to the monitor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tell me, Counselor, in regard<br>
    to my lecture, which do you<br>
    suppose would provide greater<br>
    clarity? A chronological<br>
    structure, or a division of each<br>
    excavation's findings into various<br>
    sociological, religious, and<br>
    environmental sub-groupings?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I thought you had already decided<br>
    on a chronological structure.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nodding; but not quite<br>
    convinced)<br>
    Still, there is something to be<br>
    said for a more scientific<br>
    approach.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, may I make a suggestion?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    By all means.</p>
  <p> Troi finally has the Captain's complete attention.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Relax! You've written a brilliant<br>
    speech.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It needs to be. Tomorrow I'll<br>
    be addressing some of the greatest<br>
    scientific minds in the<br>
    Federation. Switzer,<br>
    Klarc-Tarn-Droth, McFarland.<br>
    Giants in the field of Archeology.<br>
    Next to them I'm nothing but an<br>
    enthusiastic amateur.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - REV. 2/5/91 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I doubt they think of you as an<br>
    amateur... not when it comes to<br>
    the ruins of Tagus Three.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (modestly)<br>
    Well, I have done my homework...<br>
    I've examined the findings of<br>
    every archaeological expedition<br>
    conducted on the planet's<br>
    surface...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's unfortunate the Taguans no<br>
    longer allow outsiders to visit<br>
    the ruins.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (wistful)<br>
    Indeed. Especially since we still<br>
    know so little about their<br>
    origin...</p>
  <p> He gestures toward the monitor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hopefully, I've been able to<br>
    construct some intriguing theories<br>
    of my own.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm sure the council members will<br>
    agree that you have.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    Your support is appreciated,<br>
    Deanna.</p>
  <p> Picard stands.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Screen off.</p>
  <p> CU screen as it goes blank.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - REV. 2/5/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> The door OPENS. Picard ENTERS looking somewhat<br>
    fatigued.</p>
  <p> The first thing he notices -- is a Horga'hn sitting<br>
    on his desk. Picard looks at it, curious... where the<br>
    hell did this thing come from? Then...</p>
  <p> VASH (O.S.)<br>
    Bring back any memories?</p>
  <p> Picard turns to see VASH stepping out of the shadows<br>
    near the door. For a moment he's taken completely<br>
    off-guard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Vash? How did you get in here?</p>
  <p> She smiles... and moves closer.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I came in through the window.</p>
  <p> Picard barely has the chance to regain his aplomb when<br>
    she snakes an arm around him and they kiss. It's going<br>
    to last awhile.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - REV. 2/5/91 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>4 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS - MORNING</p>
  <p> Vash, wearing the same outfit from the night before,<br>
    and Picard, in his dress uniform, sit at a table eating<br>
    a brekfast of rolls and jam. Though there is still a<br>
    warm afterglow from the evening's activities, Picard is<br>
    slightly ill at ease about playing host to Vash aboard<br>
    the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I had no idea you were a member<br>
    of the Archaeology Council.</p>
  <p> Vash only smiles.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are a member?<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Aren't you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - REV. 2/1/91 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    More or less.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why have you come to Tagus Three?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    To see you, of course.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is that the only reason?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Isn't it enough?</p>
  <p> She's moves closer to him. It's an intimate moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    I wish I could believe you?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (smiling right back)<br>
    I'd be disappointed if you did.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    I really have missed you,<br>
    Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> But before they can act on a mutual impulse the DOOR<br>
    CHIMES. Picard waits until Vash steps away before<br>
    answering.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY strides in.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm sorry I'm late...<br>
    (noticing Vash)<br>
    Oh, excuse me. I didn't know you<br>
    had company.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's quite all right, Doctor.<br>
    Beverly Crusher allow me to<br>
    introduce Vash. A friend of mine<br>
    with the Archeology Council.</p>
  <p> The two women exchange greetings.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - 1/31/91 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Vash)<br>
    I didn't mean to interrupt. The<br>
    Captain and I often share morning<br>
    tea.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Yes, Jean-Luc has told me all<br>
    about you.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Really? When was that?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    On Risa. Where we met.</p>
  <p> Beverly is finding this all very interesting.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I see.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    That must have been during your<br>
    vacation last year.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (giving nothing away)<br>
    So it was.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Vash)<br>
    I'm surprised he never mentioned<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    So am I.</p>
  <p> She shoots Picard a look, but no explanation is<br>
    forthcoming.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Are you busy, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not at the moment.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I was wondering, I would love to<br>
    see some more of this marvelous<br>
    ship...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - 1/31/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'd be delighted to show it to<br>
    you. If that's alright with you,<br>
    Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> But he doesn't seem thrilled at the prospect. As Vash<br>
    passes him on the way out...</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (sotto voce)<br>
    Don't worry, I promise to behave<br>
    myself.</p>
  <p> Picard does not look reassured.</p>
  <p>5 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> The lounge is only lightly populated at the moment.</p>
  <p> Riker is seated alone having a drink.</p>
  <p> Beverly and Vash ENTER.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And this is Ten Forward, where<br>
    the Council's welcoming reception<br>
    is to be held this afternoon.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (liking what she sees)<br>
    I couldn't think of a better<br>
    location.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Tell me, does Jean-Luc come here<br>
    often?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No, not often.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I didn't think so.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The Captain is a very private man.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - 1/31/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    He certainly acted that way when<br>
    we first met.<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    But I managed to loosen him up.</p>
  <p> Beverly would definitely like to learn more about this<br>
    woman.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Would you like something to drink?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Please.</p>
  <p> Beverly walks over to the bar. Vash checks out the<br>
    view from the window as Riker APPROACHES.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Eternity never looked so lovely.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Excuse me?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I was referring to the view.<br>
    Eternity never looked so lovely.</p>
  <p> Vash gives him a shrewd appraisal.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    You must be Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    I'm afraid you have me at a<br>
    disadvantage.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I didn't mean to interrupt. I<br>
    believe you were about to tell<br>
    me that my eyes are as mysterious<br>
    as the stars.</p>
  <p> Riker is intrigued. How the hell did she know?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (thinks he's figured<br>
    it out)<br>
    You're a Betazoid.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - 1/31/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Not at all. It's just that<br>
    Jean-Luc does quite a good<br>
    imitation of you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He does?</p>
  <p> Beverly comes back with the drinks.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I see you two have met.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not exactly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Vash is a member of the Archeology<br>
    Council. And a friend of the<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So I've gathered.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    They met during his visit to Risa.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    On Risa?<br>
    (amused)<br>
    That must have been a better<br>
    vacation than he let on.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    You mean he never mentioned me<br>
    to you either?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Believe me, if he had, I would<br>
    have remembered.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (a bit frustrated)<br>
    You'd think he'd have told someone<br>
    about me.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Doctor Crusher, please report to<br>
    Sickbay.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - 1/31/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    On my way.<br>
    (to Vash)<br>
    I'm afraid I won't be able to<br>
    finish up our tour.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Perhaps Commander Riker could fill<br>
    in for me.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It would be my pleasure.</p>
  <p> Beverly leaves. Riker and Vash head for the door.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    So you're the one who asked<br>
    Jean-Luc to buy the Horga'han.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That was me.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Tell me Commander, do you collect<br>
    sexual fertility symbols?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I wouldn't call it a very large<br>
    collection.</p>
  <p> And they're out the door.</p>
  <p>6 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> DATA and GEORDI at Science Station, WORF at Tactical.<br>
    N.D.'s elsewhere.</p>
  <p> Riker and Vash EXIT the aft turbolift.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And that brings us to the Main<br>
    Bridge, the Command center of the<br>
    Enterprise, and the end of our<br>
    tour.</p>
  <p> He brings her over to the Science Station.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Vash, I'd like you to meet<br>
    Commander La Forge and Commander<br>
    Data...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - 1/31/91 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> An exchange of greetings. Riker gestures over to Worf<br>
    who looks on with disapproval.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And this is Lieutenant Worf.<br>
    (noticing Worf's scowl)<br>
    Something wrong, Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, I was not informed that<br>
    Council Members had been granted<br>
    bridge clearance.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think we can make an exception<br>
    in this case, Mister Worf. Vash<br>
    is the Captain's guest.</p>
  <p> Interested glances all around. Worf is somewhat at<br>
    a loss for what to say.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (finally)<br>
    Welcome aboard.</p>
  <p> Riker leads Vash over to the Command area.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Is this where Jean-Luc sits?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (pointing it out)<br>
    That's the big chair.</p>
  <p> To everyone's surprise she sits down in it. It<br>
    provides a definite sense of power.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I can see where being a starship<br>
    Captain does have its rewards.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    I'm glad you approve.</p>
  <p> All eyes turn to Picard who has just exited the Ready<br>
    Room. Vash stands.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - 1/31/91 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Jean-Luc. Commander Riker was<br>
    just showing me the bridge.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Doctor Crusher was called to<br>
    Sickbay.</p>
  <p> Picard nods. An awkward beat of silence.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So, did you enjoy your tour?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Very much.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> Another awkward moment.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I guess I'll head back to my room<br>
    now and get ready for the<br>
    reception.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    By all means.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Well, I suppose I'll see you then.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I look forward to it.</p>
  <p> She turns and makes the long walk back up the ramp to<br>
    the turbolift.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (watching her go)<br>
    Fascinating woman.</p>
  <p> No comment, from Picard.</p>
  <p>7 ANGLE ON</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi. Geordi has also watched Vash EXIT<br>
    the bridge.</p>
  <p> As the turbolift doors close he breaks into a grin.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    You find something humorous,<br>
    Geordi?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Didn't you notice how ill-at-ease<br>
    the Captain seemed around Vash?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. However I see nothing<br>
    amusing in his hostility toward<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That wasn't hostility, Data.<br>
    (off Data's look)<br>
    He likes her.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    A lot.</p>
  <p> Still smiling, Geordi turns back to the science<br>
    monitor. A puzzled Data is left pondering the<br>
    intricacies of human relationships.</p>

  <p> The reception. COUNCIL MEMBERS mingle with the crew.<br>
    A rather informal time is being had by all.</p>
  <p>10 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Vash has cornered TROI over by a buffet table.</p>

  <p> VASH<br>
    I don't understand, I thought<br>
    being ship's counselor meant the<br>
    Captain confided in you.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He does. When he feels it's<br>
    necessary.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    And he never spoke to you about<br>
    me?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Not that I can recall.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Not even a hint?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You must understand, the Captain<br>
    is a very...</p>
  <p> TROI &amp; VASH<br>
    (together)<br>
    Private man.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I know...</p>
  <p> She spots Picard who is deep in discussion with a<br>
    Vulcan Council Member.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Will you excuse me?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Certainly.</p>
  <p> Vash walks off.</p>
  <p>11 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Vash passes by Worf, Geordi, Beverly and Data.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

    Nice legs.<br>

    For a human.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - 1/31/91 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>12 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Picard and the Vulcan.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I agree, the Vulcan excavations<br>
    on Tagus Three were extensive.<br>
    Unfortunately, they were confined<br>
    to the northeastern part of the<br>
    city.</p>
  <p> Vash appears at his elbow.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Jean-Luc, we need to talk.</p>
  <p> One look and Picard knows she means it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to the Vulcan)<br>
    Pardon me.</p>
  <p> He and Vash move to a private spot.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The reception seems to be a<br>
    success.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Forget the reception for a moment.<br>
    How come you've never mentioned<br>
    me to your friends?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What would you have me tell them?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Maybe that we met, for one thing.<br>
    That we had an adventure together.<br>
    Some fun...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm afraid that wasn't possible.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Why not?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It would have<br>
    been... inappropriate.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I wasn't expecting you to go into<br>
    any intimate details.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - REV. 2/5/91 - ACT ONE 17.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A Captain does not share his<br>
    personal feelings with his crew.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Is that a Starfleet regulation?<br>
    Or did you make that one up<br>
    yourself?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry if you're upset.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    And I'm sorry if my being here<br>
    embarrasses you.</p>
  <p> And with that she turns and walks away.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    How was the reception?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (brusque)<br>
    Splendid.</p>
  <p> He EXITS into the Ready Room.</p>
  <p>14 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS and stops as he SEES --</p>
  <p>15 Q</p>
  <p> seated at his desk dressed in a Starfleet uniform.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Jean-Luc! How wonderful to see<br>
    you again.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>16 INT. READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As before.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Well don't just stand there, say<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> Picard advances into the room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Get out of my chair.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I was hoping for something more<br>
    along the lines of &quot;Welcome back,<br>
    Q. It's a pleasure to see you<br>
    again old friend.&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are not friends.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You wound me, mon Capitain.</p>
  <p> Q snaps his fingers and now it's Picard who sits at his<br>
    desk and Q who stands before him.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    There, perhaps now your manners<br>
    will show some improvement.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What brings you here, Q? Have you<br>
    been banished from the Continuum<br>
    once again?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Hardly. They're still apologizing<br>
    to me for the last time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then what is it you want?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - REV. 2/5/91 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Must I always have a reason to<br>
    stop by. I was in the sector<br>
    and...<br>
    (Picard doesn't buy it)<br>
    Alright. You force a confession<br>
    from me. The truth is I have a<br>
    debt to settle.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A debt?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    To you, Picard. And it gnaws at<br>
    me. It interferes with each day.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have no idea what you're talking<br>
    about...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Without your assistance at our<br>
    last encounter, I never would<br>
    have survived. I would have taken<br>
    my own life but for you, Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We all make mistakes.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Your good deed made possible my<br>
    reinstatement into the continuum.<br>
    And I resent owing you<br>
    anything... so I'm here to pay<br>
    up... what shall it be... tell<br>
    me and I'll be gone...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Just be gone. That will suffice<br>
    nicely.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    No, it must be something...<br>
    something...<br>
    (searching)<br>
    ...constructive. My new word for<br>
    the day.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Some other time, all right?<br>
    Right now I have several things<br>
    to attend to.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - REV. 2/5/91 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Yes, your speech. I've read it.<br>
    I found it dull and pedantic.<br>
    Much like yourself.<br>
    (an idea)<br>
    I could help you with it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You've never actually been to the<br>
    ruins in Tagus Three, have you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They've been sealed off for over<br>
    a century.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    How can you write about what you<br>
    haven't seen?</p>
  <p>16A ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Q is suddenly wearing a safari suit...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (brightening)<br>
    I'll take you there!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Impossible. That would mean<br>
    breaking Taguan law.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Must you always be so ethical?<br>
    (thinking)<br>
    I suppose we could travel back<br>
    in time. You could see what Tagus<br>
    was like two billion years ago.<br>
    They really knew how to have fun<br>
    in those days.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm afraid my answer is still no.<br>
    My lecture will have to stand on<br>
    its own. Now, will you please<br>
    leave my ship.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Then you refuse my help?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - REV. 2/5/91 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>16A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Completely.</p>
  <p> A beat as Q broods. Then finally...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (mildly)<br>
    You're simply impossible to find<br>
    a gift for, Picard.</p>
  <p> And he's gone.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Conn)<br>
    Commander Riker, report to my<br>
    Ready Room.</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've just been paid a visit by<br>
    Q.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Q?<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    Any idea what he's up to?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He wants to do something nice for<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> Riker REACTS. That definitely sounds like trouble.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll alert the crew.</p>
  <p> OFF Picard's look of approval:</p>
  <p>17 INT. CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS the turbolift. He heads down the Corridor<br>
    on the way to meet with one of the Council Officials.<br>
    At the hall he hesitates, turns left instead of right.</p>
  <p>18 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Picard HALTS at a doorway. RINGS the bell.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - 1/31/91 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> VASH (V.O.)<br>
    Who's there?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's me.</p>
  <p> VASH (V.O.)<br>
    Who?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> The door slides open. Vash stands in the entrance.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    May I come in?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    What for?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    To talk.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I'm listening.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If it's all the same to you I'd<br>
    rather this discussion not take<br>
    place in a public corridor.</p>
  <p> He slips past her.</p>
  <p>19 INT. VASH'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> The first thing Picard notices are various digging<br>
    tools piled in a corner. He looks over at Vash.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I thought these were &quot;private&quot;<br>
    quarters.</p>
  <p> Picard picks up a PADD off the table.</p>
  <p>20 INSERT PADD</p>
  <p> A map of the ruins of Tagus.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - 1/31/91 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>21 BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> Picard places the Padd back on the table.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And I thought I was the only<br>
    reason you came to Tagus.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I never fooled you for a second.</p>
  <p> She moves closer to Picard.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Still, you are the most important<br>
    reason.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Am I?</p>
  <p> Vash steps away.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    That's the trouble with being such<br>
    a well known liar. Even when I<br>
    tell the truth no one believes<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> Picard refuses to be swayed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm afraid all this equipment will<br>
    have to be confiscated.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Is that necessary?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I could have you placed in the<br>
    brig.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Why don't you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If the Taguans were to catch you<br>
    down there...</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    You gave me the same warning about<br>
    Sarathong Five.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I remember.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Love&quot; - REV. 2/5/91 - ACT TWO 25-25A. </p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Well, it didn't stop me from going<br>
    there. I brought back some very<br>
    impressive artifacts, too.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Which you no doubt sold for a nice<br>
    profit.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (angry)<br>
    It's what I do!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not while you're aboard my ship.<br>
    I will not allow it.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Let's get one thing straight,<br>
    Picard. I can not change who<br>
    I am for you or anyone else.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nor can I change who I am.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (calmly)<br>
    Then we have nothing more to say<br>
    to each other.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So it would seem.</p>
  <p> Picard leaves. Vash sits at the table. She's<br>
    depressed and upset.</p>
  <p>22 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Q's head APPEARS from the bulkhead behind her. He's<br>

    What do you think it is?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What do I think what is?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    About her. That, you know, gets<br>
    to the Captain.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps it is their common<br>
    interest in archaeology.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't think so.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But Counselor, as an<br>
    archaeologist, her company would<br>
    certainly be intellectually<br>
    stimulating to the Captain.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    She's not just stimulating his<br>
    intellect, Data...</p>

    It's really none of our business.</p>
  <p> They turn a corner and come face to face with...</p>

  <p> Leaning against a wall. Wearing a Starfleet uniform<br>
    again.</p>

  <p>23A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (sneering)<br>
    It's love.</p>
  <p> He DISAPPEARS.</p>
  <p>24 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS, disgruntled. He goes into his bedroom,<br>
    which is dark. As he enters, he sees a figure under<br>
    the covers in his bed. A slight smile creeps to his<br>
    lips. He moves to the bed, pulls back the covers to<br>
    reveal Q.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Sleeping alone, Picard?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm in no mood for your<br>
    foolishness, Q.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I thought there was something<br>
    different about you. You seemed<br>
    tense, preoccupied. Somewhat...<br>
    smaller.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    At first I thought it was that<br>
    horrible lecture of yours. But<br>
    I was mistaken.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Whatever game you want to play<br>
    will have to wait until tomorrow.</p>
  <p> Picard gets into bed but Q refuses to be ignored.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I had such hopes for you,<br>
    Jean-Luc. I thought you were a<br>
    bit more evolved than the rest<br>
    of your species. But now I<br>
    realize you're as weak as all the<br>
    others.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Still, it pains me to see the<br>
    great Picard brought down by a<br>
    woman.</p>

  <p> Picard, tries not to feign disinterest.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What woman?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Don't play coy with me Captain.<br>
    I witnessed your little spat with<br>
    Vash. Nor will I soon forget that<br>
    look of misery on your face. The<br>
    pain. The anguish. If I didn't<br>
    know better I would have thought<br>
    you were already married.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You really must be bored, Q.<br>
    You're letting your imagination<br>
    run away with you.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    This human emotion of Love is<br>
    a dangerous thing, Picard. You<br>
    are obviously ill equipped to<br>
    handle it. She's found a<br>
    vulnerability in you... a<br>
    vulnerability that I've wanted<br>
    to find for years. If I had known<br>
    this sooner, I would have arrived<br>
    as a female. Mark my words,<br>
    Jean-Luc, this is your Achilles<br>
    heel..</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Believe what you wish.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You deny you care for this woman?</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't answer.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Believe me, Picard, I'd be doing<br>
    you a big favor if I simply turned<br>
    her into a Klabnian eel.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (very seriously)<br>
    Stay away from her, Q.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ladies and gentlemen, members of<br>
    the Archeology Council. Welcome.<br>
    It is the mystery of Tagus Three<br>
    that brings us together today...<br>
    a mystery that has invited more<br>
    argument and deduction than the<br>

    phenomenon out to Beverly, a similar cap appears on her<br>

    Beverly also carries a sword; Troi a longbow and<br>
    arrows. Data is bald except for a soupbowl fringe<br>

    I doubt there are many oak trees<br>
    on Tagus. No, my guess is this<br>
    is supposed to be Earth.<br>
    (off reactions)<br>
    Sometime around the twelfth<br>

    ease here within the sylvan glade<br>
    or risk your life to save a woman<br>
    you care nothing about.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My feelings toward Vash are<br>

  <p> Q<br>
    Impossible. You see, I've given<br>

    life of its own. I don't know<br>
    how things will turn out anymore<br>

    You mean I'm the one getting<br>
    executed?</p>
  <p> Though Vash is at a loss to explain how she came to be<br>

    tower.</p>
  <p> Only a few servants are visible as a haughty Q (still<br>
    dressed as the High Sheriff) surveys his domain with<br>
    smug satisfaction.</p>
  <p> Nearby is an EXECUTIONER. Off to the side, a TINKER,<br>
    with his back to us, repairs the chains on a pair of<br>
    shackles. The massively built Executioner is busy<br>
    sharpening the blade of his broad axe against a foot<br>

  <p> VASH<br>

  <p> SIR GUY<br>
    Have you taken leave of your<br>

    Lovely creature.</p>
  <p> Q<br>

    She is intriguing.</p>
  <p> Q is determined not to allow his well-laid scheme go<br>
    astray.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Sir Guy, perhaps it would be wise<br>
    to keep this wedding a secret for<br>
    now.</p>
  <p> SIR GUY<br>
    What are you babbling about?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You still hope to capture Robin<br>
    Hood, don't you?</p>
  <p> SIR GUY<br>
    I live for the moment.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (thinking of Picard)<br>
    Well, if he were to hear that<br>
    Marian's life was no longer in<br>
    danger, there would be no need<br>
    for him to come to Nottingham to<br>
    rescue her.</p>
  <p> Sir Guy slaps Q on the back.</p>
  <p> SIR GUY<br>
    By heavens, you're right. No word<br>
    of my wedding shall leave these<br>
    walls.<br>

  <p>41 INT. MAID MARIAN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Vash paces around the room. Suddenly she stops.<br>
    Listening to what could be a faint rustling. The noise<br>
    ceases. Vash continues to pace. The rustling resumes,<br>
    louder now. Again, Vash stops pacing. The sound,<br>
    and now it's clearly the rustling of vines, is coming<br>
    from outside her open window. She moves towards the<br>
    embrasure, when SUDDENLY a hand APPEARS on the ledge.<br>
    With a final GRUNT, Picard lifts himself through the<br>
    window. Vash throws herself at him.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Jean-Luc. Am I glad to see you.</p>
  <p> She throws herself into his arms, and kisses him.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    You would not believe what I've<br>
    been through. One minute I'm on<br>
    the Enterprise... the next thing<br>
    I know I'm here in Nottingham.<br>
    First, they're going to chop my<br>
    head off... and now I'm supposed<br>
    to marry someone named Sir Guy...<br>
    and everyone insists on calling<br>
    me Marian...</p>

    Come, we don't have much time.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Are the others outside?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They're waiting for us back in<br>

    Yes, now let's...</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    What kind of plan is that?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    An excellent one if you'd only<br>
    hurry up.</p>
  <p> But Vash refuses to budge.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    You do realize our lives are at<br>
    stake here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Only too well.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    And this is the best strategy<br>
    you could come up with? One man<br>
    against an entire castle.</p>

    stay here.</p>
  <p> She walks away from the window.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And do what?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Marry Sir Guy if I have to.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (ironic)<br>
    That is brilliant.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    If there's a way to escape, I'll<br>
    find it, eventually. With my head<br>
    still attached.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You don't really expect me to<br>
    leave you here?</p>
  <p> He reaches for her. She pulls away.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I can take care of myself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Must you be so stubborn?</p>
  <p> Suddenly the door is flying OPEN and Sir Guy enters<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    Behind me.</p>
  <p> He steps in front of her and reaches for his sword.<br>
    But Vash is quicker. She pulls the blade out of his<br>
    scabbard and points it at his chest.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    You should have left while you<br>

    Congratulations, Gisbourne. I<br>
    see you've snared the jackal.</p>

  <p> SERVANT<br>
    You sent for me, M'Lady?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    You must take this letter to<br>
    Robin's men.</p>
  <p> SERVANT<br>
    You want me to go to Sherwood<br>

    But it's dark. I'll get lost.</p>
  <p> Vash continues to write.</p>
  <p> SERVANT<br>
    Besides, it's not safe. What with<br>
    all them hedge robbers and worse<br>
    lurking about.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Please, this is urgent.</p>
  <p> SERVANT<br>
    You ask me, you'd be better off<br>
    staying with Sir Guy. He's got<br>
    a future. Why you'll be living<br>
    in London before you know it.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    But you must go. Otherwise,<br>
    they're going to kill him.</p>
  <p> She's about to offer the folded letter to the Servant,<br>

    letter on the table as Q ENTERS.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    How dare you come barging in here<br>
    this way!</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I come to offer apologies for my<br>
    harsh words earlier. I had no<br>
    idea you were so ruthless. The<br>
    cold blooded way you betrayed<br>
    Robin was most impressive.</p>
  <p> Q is now standing right by the table. Vash forces<br>
    herself not to glance down at the letter.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    That's most gracious of you.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I admit I was surprised...<br>

    (cheerfully)<br>
    Why this is wonderful. Such<br>

    (beat)<br>
    He was right about one thing,<br>
    Jean-Luc. As ridiculous as it<br>
    was, his game did prove how much<br>
    you care.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I may not share my feelings with<br>
    my crew, but I do have them.</p>
  <p> A warm moment passes between them.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I'm going to miss you, Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I wouldn't be surprised if our<br>
    paths cross again.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I'll see to it.</p>
  <p> They kiss.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So, where are you off to now?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I haven't made up my mind.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Qpid&quot; - REV. 2/6/91 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>54 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Remind you of someone you know?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (amused in spite of<br>
    himself)<br>
    As a matter of fact... yes.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (to Vash)<br>
    We are going to have fun. I'll<br>
    take you places no human could<br>
    ever hope to see.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Who can resist an offer like that?</p>
  <p> Picard sees there's no way to change her mind. He<br>
    advances on Q.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As payment in full for your debt<br>
    to me, you will guarantee her<br>
    safety...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    She will not be harmed, Jean-Luc.<br>
    I promise you that.</p>
  <p> Picard looks over at Vash. A silent farewell.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Well, aren't you going to kiss<br>
    her good-bye?</p>
  <p> Picard and Vash stare at him until he gets the hint.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Oh, all right.</p>
  <p> He VANISHES.</p>
  <p> Vash smiles at Picard.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Well aren't you?</p>
  <p> A final kiss. Then Vash steps back.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Goodbye, Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> She VANISHES.</p>

  <p>55 C.U. PICARD</p>
  <p> A beat. Then a trace of a smile appears on his face.</p>
