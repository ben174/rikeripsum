  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 44143.7.<br>
    Due to a medical emergency, we<br>
    have been forced to cut short a<br>
    two-day liberty on Ogus Two and<br>
    set course for Starbase<br>
    Four-One-Six.</p>
  <p>1A INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> A turbolift door opens and TROI and a trembling twelve-<br>
    year-old boy, JAKE POTTS, emerge and head down the<br>
    corridor.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It seems a young man's practical<br>
    joke has come dangerously close<br>
    to a lethal conclusion.</p>

    3</p>
  <p>3A INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> RIKER is standing alone at the window (with the ship<br>
    travelling at Warp speed) as Troi and Jake ENTER. Troi<br>
    motions Jake to sit.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well Mister Potts, why don't we<br>
    start at the beginning?</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    (still trembling)<br>
    It was a joke, sir. I just meant<br>
    to scare him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Brothers&quot; - REV. 7/19/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    From the beginning, please.</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    (nervously and very<br>
    quickly)<br>
    We were at the arcade, sir. I<br>
    brought this balloon with me,<br>
    filled with red pillion dye. You<br>
    see, Willie is always making fun<br>
    of me. I figured I'd get him<br>
    back. I only meant to scare him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Slow down, Jake.</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    (slower)<br>
    We programmed the game for an<br>
    ordinary laser duel. You know,<br>
    twenty-one points. Four points<br>
    for a...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    I'm familiar with the game. Go<br>
    on.</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    We went out to the forest behind<br>
    the east arcade. I told Willie<br>
    that his laser pistol looked kind<br>
    of funny, almost like a real one.<br>
    When I went behind the trees, I<br>
    put the balloon into my vest, and<br>
    then...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Brothers&quot; - REV. 7/24/90 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So you made your nine year-old<br>
    brother think he killed you?</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And then he ran away.</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And while he was hiding he ate<br>
    the fruit of a cove palm.</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    It was just a joke. I didn't...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I assume you are aware of the<br>
    infectious nature of the parasites<br>
    which inhabit cove palms?</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    I am now, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you familiar with the<br>
    condition upon which I agreed to<br>
    allow you two boys to remain on<br>
    the Enterprise when your parents<br>
    went on sabbatical?</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    That we'd stay out of trouble,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (keys insignia)<br>
    Mister Data.<br>
    (to Jake)<br>
    Think about it Mister Potts. And<br>
    while you're at it, think about<br>
    what might have happened had we<br>
    not been this close to a starbase<br>
    medical facility.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Brothers&quot; - REV. 7/19/90 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3A CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Data ENTERS from the Bridge and moves over to stand<br>
    next to Jake.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Have you contacted the boy's<br>
    parents?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    They are fully aware of the<br>
    situation, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Good, escort this young man to<br>
    the quarantine anteroom. Perhaps<br>
    he'll be helpful in lifting his<br>
    brother's spirits.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> The two begin to EXIT.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Jake)<br>
    Please don't think that you have<br>
    heard the last of this, Mister<br>
    Potts.</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    No, sir. I mean yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Data and Jake EXIT. Troi looks to Riker.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He's very frightened.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    As well he should be. I've never<br>
    been a proponent of practical<br>
    jokes. More often than not, they<br>
    have unfortunate results.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I wouldn't be surprised if this<br>
    was his last practical joke for<br>
    a long while.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Brothers&quot; - REV. 7/24/90 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>3A CONTINUED: (4)</p>

    brother's future at the moment,<br>

  <p> Moving downward. Data and Jake.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Our Sickbay does have the facility<br>
    to isolate parasitic proto-viruses<br>
    but not in a favorable time frame<br>
    for your brother.</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    (more to himself)<br>
    He really could die.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Fortunately we are only two days<br>
    from Starbase Four-One-Six, and<br>
    their laboratory can...</p>
  <p> Data freezes. His head begins to jerk in a more<br>
    pronounced fashion than usual.</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    Can what sir?</p>
  <p> Data, not responding, continues to twitch. He raises<br>
    his arm and touches the turbolift control panel twice.<br>
    We hear the turbolift stop briefly and change<br>
    directions.</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    Their laboratory can do what,<br>
    Commander?</p>
  <p> Data continues not to respond.</p>
  <p> JAKE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Sir, I know I made a mistake...<br>
    I can tell you're angry... but<br>
    if you're not going to talk to<br>
    me...</p>

    Observation Lounge and cross to the Command Center.<br>
    DATA descends the ramp toward Ops.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Back so soon, Mister Data?</p>
  <p> Data does not respond. He relieves a supernumerary at<br>

    his panel. Before Riker can react...</p>

    New course set for heading<br>
    three-four-one mark two-two-one.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Course set by whom?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Not me, Commander.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    What's going on?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (notices Data calmly<br>
    working his panel)<br>
    Data, who programmed the new<br>
    coordinates?</p>
  <p> Data calmly works on without responding.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Warp nine-point-three, sir.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    I don't advise this, Captain.<br>
    If we're going to maintain the<br>
    realignment progression we<br>
    shouldn't be pushing more than<br>
    warp eight for at least an hour.</p>
  <p> Picard looks to Troi who hasn't got a clue. He rises<br>
    and approaches Data.</p>

  <p> Geordi, ENSIGN KOPF and TWO SUPERNUMERARIES are at the<br>
    pool table.</p>
  <p> ENSIGN KOPF<br>
    Our velocity is holding steady<br>
    at warp nine-point-three. Do you<br>
    wish to override, Commander?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not yet. Computer, isolate cause<br>
    of life support failure.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Atmosphere conditioning pumps on<br>
    Deck one are operating in<br>
    negative mode.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Kopf)<br>
    How could that be? There are<br>
    seven independent safety<br>
    interlocks to prevent that.</p>
  <p> Picard, Worf, and TWO MORE SUPERNUMERARIES ENTER from<br>
    the Turbolift and head for the pool table.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sir, I think we've found the<br>
    problem, but it doesn't really<br>
    make sense.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    It seems we have more than one<br>
    problem. Bring the Enterprise<br>
    to a full stop, Commander.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Full stop, Ensign Kopf.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Brothers&quot; - REV. 7/19/90 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>

    It's not responding, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker and Wesley ENTER from around the corner.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I ordered all helm control<br>
    transferred down here, damn it!</p>

    We did sir. We've been waiting<br>

    I'm going to have to do this at<br>

  <p> NOTE: The following three corridor scenes take place<br>
    very quickly.</p>
  <p>32 INT. CORRIDOR &quot;A&quot; (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Turbolift doors open as Data ENTERS, turns left<br>
    and heads down the corridor. A SECURITY TEAM runs<br>
    toward him from behind, but is stopped by a force field<br>
    which appears across the corridor in front of them.</p>
  <p> NOTE: The force field only appears for an instant when<br>
    the first member of the team runs into it. Force<br>
    fields are only visible when they appear, disappear, or<br>
    are touched by people or phaser fire.</p>
  <p> Another force field in front of Data vanishes when he<br>
    reaches it, only to be replaced by another ten meters<br>
    ahead. Immediately after Data passes through a force<br>
    field in front of him, it reappears as a force field<br>
    protecting his back. The force field, which previously<br>
    protected his back, then vanishes.</p>
  <p> Data continues down the corridor and sees ANOTHER<br>
    SECURITY TEAM coming toward him.</p>

  <p> The force field in front of Data disappears only to<br>
    be replaced by another further down the corridor. The<br>
    new force field runs across the corridor at a point<br>
    where it intersects with another corridor. The<br>
    security team which is still on the far side of the<br>
    force field cannot move forward. Data reaches the<br>
    intersection and turns left.</p>
  <p>33 INT. CORRIDOR &quot;B&quot; (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A new force field appears in front and behind Data as<br>
    before.</p>

  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> A THIRD SECURITY TEAM headed by Worf appears around<br>
    the corner in front of Data. Unlike the previous<br>
    encounter, Data has no intersecting corridor between<br>
    himself and the security team. Unfazed, Data continues<br>
    ahead as Worf raises his phaser.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I order you to stop.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Computer, begin scan-phase.</p>
  <p> The force field between Data and the security team<br>
    becomes visible and starts to move in the same<br>
    direction as Data. Seeing this, Worf stops and fires.<br>
    The phaser fire disperses with a flash as it hits the<br>
    force field. Worf fires again, with the same results,<br>
    only now the flash is even closer. The security team<br>
    is now backing away from the encroaching force field.<br>
    A guard raises his phaser to fire.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No, it's too close.</p>
  <p> Data, his expression unchanged, walks forward only<br>
    meters from the retreating security team! The creeping<br>
    force field is all that separates them. When Data<br>
    reaches the intersection, which Worf had earlier<br>
    entered from, he turns right.</p>
  <p> The force field stops at the far side, sealing off Worf<br>
    and his team.</p>

    I wouldn't advise that, sir. The<br>
    phase coils don't take well to<br>

  <p> Before Riker can finish his question, Data<br>

    reconfirm the force field. He is answered by a sharp<br>
    zap to his raised hand.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    You do bear a resemblance to<br>
    Doctor Noonian Soong, the<br>
    cyberneticist who constructed me.<br>
    But, Doctor Soong was killed<br>
    shortly afterward by the<br>
    Crystalline Entity.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (laughs softly to<br>
    himself)<br>
    It's your lucky day, Data. You've<br>
    found your long lost father, and<br>
    he's alive. What do you think<br>
    of that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But the colony was destroyed,<br>
    there were no survivors.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    I've never felt too comfortable<br>
    living anywhere without a prearranged<br>
    route of escape. I<br>
    admit, I wouldn't have guessed<br>
    I'd be running from a giant<br>
    snowflake, but...<br>
    (he shrugs)</p>
  <p> Data studies Soong's face.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is really you.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    Indulge an old man and stand on<br>
    one leg for me.</p>
  <p> Data is truly confused. How did he get here? What<br>
    should he say to Soong? Why is he being asked to stand<br>
    on one leg?</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    Please.</p>
  <p> Data obediently lifts one leg. Soong stares silently<br>
    for a long beat.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Brothers&quot; - REV. 7/18/90 - ACT THREE 33A.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    Excellent! You know before I<br>
    activated your positronic net,<br>
    I had the damnedest time working<br>
    out those fluidic equilibrium<br>
    circuits.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Brothers&quot; - REV. 7/30/90 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Data remains on one foot.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps you could help me contact<br>
    my ship.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    If you can't raise them with<br>
    your...<br>
    (he points)<br>
    communicator, what can I do?<br>
    (re: Data's foot)<br>
    It's alright. You can put it<br>
    down.</p>
  <p> Data puts his foot down.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    They'll be back for you. I'm<br>
    certain. Trust me.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Now, tell me. How are you at<br>
    differentiating between a humid<br>
    day and a dry one?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (a bit confused by the<br>
    quick change in<br>
    subject)<br>
    The moisture content of the ship's<br>
    atmosphere is maintained at a<br>
    moderate thirty-seven percent.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    No, No. Not your ship. When<br>
    you're on land, a planet.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I can differentiate between<br>
    varying hygrometric levels.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    Without some sort of external<br>
    sensor?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    What then? What's the difference?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Brothers&quot; - REV. 7/30/90 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> Data's not sure what he's asking.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Between humid and dry?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Humid air feels different against<br>
    my skin, sir. And it carries<br>
    smells differently. I assume this<br>
    is due to the fact that<br>
    moisture...</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    How wonderful. I tried so hard<br>
    to get that right. It's very<br>
    important you know.</p>
  <p> A delighted Soong walks to his dinosaur collection and<br>
    begins fiddling with a very small model.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    May I ask why you have brought<br>
    me here?</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    I incorporated an encoded homing<br>
    circuit into your sublogic<br>
    controller.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Your response refers to how you<br>
    brought me here, not why.</p>
  <p> Soong continues to fiddle with his model, not looking<br>
    up.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (somewhat sarcastically)<br>
    Haven't you missed me, Data?</p>
  <p> Answering his own question.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I suppose that's impossible.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I assumed you dead, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Brothers&quot; - REV. 7/24/90 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED: (6)</p>
  <p> Soong puts the tiny dinosaur back in place.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    Well, my longevity isn't the only<br>
    surprise I have in store for you,<br>

  <p> On Data's perplexed reaction we</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The quarantine field in Sickbay,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You have access to it?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    When he transferred force field<br>
    control to the Bridge he must have<br>
    only specified fields he was<br>
    planning to initiate. The<br>
    quarantine field was already<br>
    operating.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Under normal circumstances, we<br>
    could divert that field energy and<br>
    use it to cancel the force field<br>
    protecting the bridge... But we<br>
    have to retain the medical<br>
    quarantine.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Determine the absolute minimum<br>
    field energy that Doctor Crusher<br>
    needs... and use the rest to get<br>
    me onto my bridge.</p>

  <p> CLOSE on a NURSE'S hand holding a hypospray as it<br>
    passes through the quarantine field openings, causing<br>
    the brief blue flicker. PULL BACK to see her deliver<br>
    the injection into Willie's neck. Beverly ENTERS and<br>
    sits in the chair the nurse has vacated. Willie<br>
    doesn't look well.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How are you feeling this morning?</p>
  <p> WILLIE<br>
    Not so great. I'm having trouble<br>
    standing up. I get sorta dizzy.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You know the old story about the<br>
    man who tells his doctor, &quot;It<br>
    hurts when I raise my arm like<br>
    this?&quot;</p>
  <p> Beverly raises her arm. Willie replies by shaking his<br>
    head.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continues, lowering<br>
    her arm)<br>
    The doctor says, &quot;Then don't raise<br>
    your arm like that.&quot;</p>
  <p> Willie manages a hint of a smile.</p>
  <p> WILLIE<br>
    (catching on)<br>
    So, if I get dizzy standing up...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Don't stand up.</p>
  <p> Geordi and a supernumerary ENTER carrying monitoring<br>
    devices.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay Doc, we're ready. If all<br>
    goes well you shouldn't notice<br>
    a thing.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Make sure all goes well,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> Geordi and the supernumerary EXIT as Beverly turns her<br>
    attention back to Willie.</p>

    Your brother says you still won't<br>
    speak to him.</p>
  <p> WILLIE<br>
    So?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    This is very hard on him, too.<br>
    He feels very guilty about what<br>
    happened. He's your brother.</p>
  <p> WILLIE<br>
    (angry)<br>
    Why is everybody so worried about<br>
    him? I'm the one who's sick...<br>
    I'm the one who's gonna die.</p>
  <p> Willie gets up and almost loses his footing, he's<br>
    trembling.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Nobody's going to die, Willie.<br>
    Do you hear me? Nobody!</p>
  <p> Willie struggles to his bed within the quarantine area<br>
    and buries his head in his hands.</p>
  <p>41 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The Bridge is empty. After a beat, the turbolift doors<br>
    open and a cautious Worf with two N.D. security guards<br>
    ENTER, phasers drawn. After a quick look --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Captain, we are in.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    We're on our way, Lieutenant.</p>

  <p> Worf snarls in frustration as we</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>42 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, and Geordi. The turbolift is moving<br>
    upward.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Beverly thinks its going to be<br>
    tight. Let's hope he didn't take<br>
    us too far off course.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's hope.</p>
  <p>43 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The turbolift doors open and Picard and Riker cross<br>
    to Worf. Geordi goes to his aft station.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

    It won't answer to my clearance,<br>
    sir.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (furious)<br>
    Security code!?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I was afraid of something like<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> A series of beeps is heard from Worf's station.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sensors are operative.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Brothers&quot; - REV. 7/30/90 - ACT THREE 40.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well at least that's something.<br>
    What have you got?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (checking his panel)<br>
    No fix on Data. But I am picking<br>
    up a single lifeform on the<br>
    surface, sir. It appears human.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's one human who's got the<br>
    answers to a lot of questions.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Something else, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> Worf studies his board.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A small vessel... entering orbit.<br>
    I detect no lifeforms aboard.</p>
  <p> On Picard's look we</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>44 INT. SOONG'S LAB (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> CLOSE ON Data's face. One hand is patting his head<br>
    rhythmically. PULL BACK to reveal his other hand, palm<br>
    open, making circular movements on his stomach. Soong<br>
    sits opposite, entranced.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    Good. Good. Keep it up. Ah<br>
    huh...</p>
  <p> Soong giggles with delight.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Old Tom Handy swore you'd never<br>
    master that. Whistle!</p>
  <p> Data, still patting and rubbing, begins to whistle<br>
    &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;... poorly. Soong's face sinks.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Brothers&quot; - REV. 7/30/90 - ACT THREE 41.</p>
  <p>44 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    Ah, well. Enough Data, sit.</p>
  <p> Data stops whistling, patting and rubbing... and sits.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    I've been able to keep track of<br>
    you from time to time. You've<br>
    become somewhat of a celebrity<br>
    in cybernetic circles.<br>
    (after a beat)<br>
    Why Starfleet?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    I gave you the ability to choose<br>
    whatever you wanted... to do<br>
    whatever you wanted. Why<br>
    Starfleet?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It was Starfleet officers who<br>
    rescued me.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    Ah. So you decided to emulate<br>
    your emancipators. How<br>
    disappointing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What choice of vocation would have<br>
    met with your approval?</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    I often hoped you might become<br>
    a scientist... perhaps a<br>
    cyberneticist.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    To follow in your footsteps, as<br>
    it were?</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    I see -- nothing wrong with that.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Brothers&quot; - 7/13/90 - ACT THREE 42.</p>
  <p>44 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    May I ask you a question, sir?</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    Certainly. Anything you'd like.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Why did you create me?</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (after a beat)<br>
    Why does a painter paint? Why<br>
    does a boxer box? You know what<br>
    Michelangelo used to say? The<br>
    sculptures he made were already<br>
    there before he started, hidden<br>
    in the marble. All he had to do<br>
    was remove the unneeded bits.<br>
    It wasn't quite that easy with<br>
    you Data. But the need to do it,<br>
    my need to do it, was no different<br>
    than Michelangelo's need.<br>
    (he rises)<br>
    Now, let me ask you a question.</p>
  <p> Data cocks his head.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (as if posing a riddle)<br>
    Why are humans so fascinated with<br>
    old things?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Old things?</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    Old buildings, churches, walls,<br>
    ancient things, antique<br>
    things... tables, clocks, knick<br>
    knacks... Why?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There are many possible<br>
    explanations.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    If you brought a Noophian to Earth<br>
    he'd look around and say, &quot;Tear<br>
    that old village down. It's<br>
    hanging in rags.<br>

  <p>44 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> SOONG (Cont'd)<br>
    Build me something new, something<br>
    efficient.&quot; But to a human, that<br>
    ancient wall, that old house, is<br>
    a shrine, something to cherish....<br>
    Again I ask you, why?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps, for humans, old things<br>
    represent a tie to the past.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    And what's so important about the<br>
    past? People needed money, they<br>
    got sick. Why tie yourself to<br>
    that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Humans are mortal. They seem to<br>
    need a sense of continuity.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    Ah hah!! Why?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    To give their lives meaning...<br>
    A sense of purpose.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    And does this continuity only run<br>
    one way, back into the past?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I suppose it is a factor in the<br>
    human desire to procreate.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    So you believe that having<br>
    children gives humans a sense of<br>
    immortality, do you?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is a reasonable explanation<br>
    to your query, sir.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    And perhaps to yours, as well,<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Brothers&quot; - REV. 7/20/90 - ACT THREE 44.</p>
  <p>44 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> A loud whoosh from offscreen causes Data and Soong<br>
    to turn. In the now-open doorway, we see a figure lit<br>
    from behind. The door whooshes closed as the figure<br>
    walks toward us through the shadows. Data and Soong<br>
    stand.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    It appears we have a visitor.</p>
  <p> The figure walks to the same central spot to which<br>
    Data did when he first arrived. As he comes out of<br>
    the shadows to a halting stop, we see that the intruder<br>
    is LORE. Data's &quot;brother&quot; is dressed in an odd outfit<br>
    reminiscent of the Pakleds. He is in the same dazed<br>
    state in which Data appeared when he arrived.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Lore!!</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (equally surprised)<br>
    Well, well, it seems we've got<br>
    ourselves a family reunion.</p>

  <p> ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>45 INT. SOONG'S LAB (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Lore is now seated in the same &quot;dentist&quot; chair in which<br>
    we found Data earlier. Soong is standing over him,<br>
    arranging some tools. Data stands beside Soong.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor, I implore you, please do<br>
    not reactivate him.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    Don't be ridiculous, Data.<br>
    (to Lore)<br>
    Open.</p>
  <p> Lore obediently opens his mouth as Soong reaches in<br>
    with an instrument.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (continuing to Data)<br>
    Lore is far from the maniacal<br>
    android you have made him out to<br>
    be. In any case, he'll obey me.<br>
    He always did.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But he admitted to an alliance<br>
    with the Crystal Entity. To gain<br>
    its favor he betrayed the<br>
    colonists and would have betrayed<br>
    the Enterprise as well had I<br>
    not...</p>
  <p> Soong is distracted by his work. He interrupts Data.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (to Lore)<br>
    Hold still...</p>
  <p> Soong does something with the tool and we hear a click.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There. One more.</p>
  <p> We hear another click and Soong continues working, not<br>
    looking up as he speaks to Data.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Brothers&quot; - REV. 7/24/90 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>45 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm well aware of Lore's<br>
    shortcomings. Remember, it was<br>
    I who deactivated him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And, as I have explained, it was<br>
    I who was responsible for his<br>
    reactivation. But it serves no<br>
    purpose to make the same mistake<br>
    twice.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (still working)<br>
    In science, Data, making the same<br>
    mistake twice is often not a<br>
    mistake at all. Quite the<br>
    contrary.</p>
  <p> The instrument makes a final click.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That should do it.</p>
  <p> Lore straightens up and looks around. He sees Data<br>
    and then Soong.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (with sarcasm)<br>
    So, you're still alive. I'm<br>
    surprised you woke me. Why didn't<br>
    you just take me apart and be done<br>
    with it? That is why the two of<br>
    you captured me?</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (patiently)<br>
    Data had nothing to do with this,<br>
    Lore. And no one captured<br>
    you... not exactly, that is. You<br>
    see, both of your brains contain<br>
    a simple homing device. Data's<br>
    was activated purposefully.<br>
    Yours... well until you walked<br>
    in that door I didn't know you<br>
    had ever been reassembled.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (to Soong)<br>
    No thanks to you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Brothers&quot; - REV. 7/30/90 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>45 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Lore turns to Data.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    But thanks to you, dear brother,<br>
    I spent nearly two years drifting<br>
    in space. If it hadn't been for<br>
    a fortunate encounter with a<br>
    Pakled trade ship, I'd still be<br>
    out there.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I had no alternative. You would<br>
    have destroyed the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Lore gives a disgusted smile.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (to Soong)<br>
    Well, since I appear to be an<br>
    uninvited guest at your little<br>
    party, I'll leave you with your<br>
    beloved son and be on my way.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    No, wait. Stay here... There<br>
    are questions I can answer.<br>
    You'll have no chance to ask them<br>
    later.<br>
    (very matter of factly)<br>
    You see, I'm dying.</p>

    Dying from what, sir?</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (pacing)<br>
    Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br>
    What do you mean you're dying?<br>
    You look fine. You're not that<br>
    old. You look fine. What is<br>
    this? Some kind of trick to see<br>
    how we'd react?</p>
  <p> Lore is agitated, emotional.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (gently)<br>
    I wish it were.</p>
  <p> Lore stares at him, sees he's telling the truth and<br>
    lowers his head, shaking it in disbelief. He is truly<br>
    feeling grief. Data's face shows no emotion. He<br>
    calmly repeats himself.</p>

  <p>47 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Beverly, Troi, Geordi and Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We have control of sensors, life<br>
    support and auxiliary power,<br>
    Captain. Nothing more.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The code, Mister La Forge?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (shaking his head)<br>
    We can't even locate the file<br>
    address. At least that would tell<br>
    us how many digits we're talking<br>
    about. Not that it would really<br>
    help.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I want something that will really<br>
    help.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And quickly. Willie Potts has<br>
    twenty-four hours, thirty-six<br>
    tops. If it goes longer than<br>
    that, the only thing Starbase<br>
    Four-One-Six will have left to<br>
    do is a postmortem.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Geordi, if the computer's<br>
    programmed to allow Data to<br>
    transport down, it would figure<br>
    that it would allow him to beam<br>
    back up. Right?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It would figure.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And Data left a trace imprint when<br>
    he beamed down?</p>

  <p>47 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    Everyone does.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So what would be involved in<br>
    pulling that trace and finding<br>
    a way to make the computer think<br>
    someone else is Data? Maybe a<br>
    few someone elses?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We'd have to access the transport<br>
    controller and reset it to a<br>
    testing mode; convince it that<br>
    it's back in school accepting<br>
    simulated inputs. It's going to<br>
    be tough without the main<br>
    computer, but we could network<br>
    a few tricorders together.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Try, Mister La Forge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>

  <p> Soong is repositioning his model dinosaurs as Lore<br>
    paces behind him, still visibly upset. Data is seated.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    You did what you had to do? What<br>
    kind of answer is that?</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    The only one I can give you. You<br>
    were not...<br>
    (he thinks of the right<br>
    word)<br>
    ... &quot;functioning&quot; properly.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Lore told me the colonists became<br>
    envious of him because you made<br>
    him &quot;so completely human.&quot;</p>

  <p>48 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (smiles sadly)<br>
    I wouldn't exactly have used the<br>
    word &quot;envious.&quot;</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (ignoring Data's line<br>
    of thought)<br>
    You disassembled me. Took me<br>
    apart... and so soon after you had<br>
    put me together. You gave me no<br>
    chance.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Lore also said the colonists<br>
    petitioned you to replace him with<br>
    a &quot;less perfect&quot; android?</p>
  <p> Soong looks to Lore as if to say, &quot;Did you really tell<br>
    him that?&quot;</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    The last thing you should think<br>
    of yourself as Data is &quot;less<br>
    perfect.&quot; The two of you are<br>
    virtually identical... except<br>
    for a bit of programming.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    It was a lie. Another lie.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (to Soong)<br>
    I would have proven to you that<br>
    I was worthy, if you had given<br>
    me the chance. But it was easier<br>
    to turn your back and build your<br>
    precious Data.</p>
  <p> Soong stands and turns to Lore.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    You were the first. You meant<br>
    as much to me as Data ever did.<br>
    But you were unstable. The<br>
    colonists weren't envious of you,<br>
    they were afraid of you. You were<br>
    unstable.</p>

    Why didn't you try to fix me?<br>
    It was within your power to fix<br>
    me!</p>
  <p> Soong sits back down at his dinosaur table. After a<br>
    beat.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    It wasn't as easy as that. The<br>
    next logical step was to construct<br>
    Data. Afterward, I planned to<br>
    get back to you... to &quot;fix&quot; you.<br>
    But I never got that chance.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>

  <p> SOONG<br>
    Enough! Sit down, both of you.</p>
  <p> They both sit.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    For all these years I've been<br>
    plagued by what went wrong.<br>
    (to Lore)<br>
    With all the complexities you<br>
    possessed, the nuances... basic<br>
    emotion seemed almost simple in<br>
    comparison. But the emotion<br>
    turned, and twisted, and became<br>
    entangled with ambition... Lore,<br>
    if I had known you were no longer<br>
    sitting in pieces on a distant<br>
    shelf... If I had known I could<br>
    push a button and bring you<br>
    here... I would have spent those<br>
    years trying to make things right<br>
    for you as well. But all I knew<br>
    of was Data.<br>

    So I worked, long and hard, and<br>
    now I believe I've succeeded.</p>
  <p> Soong pulls a little circuit chip from a small<br>
    container and holds it up.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This is why I brought you here.<br>
    Basic emotions, Data. Simple<br>
    feelings. Your feelings.</p>
  <p> Data cocks his head, but says nothing. He steps closer<br>
    to inspect the chip.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I've imagined how hard it's been<br>
    for you... living amongst beings<br>
    so moved by emotion.</p>
  <p> Lore crosses to Data.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (seemingly sincere, he<br>
    whispers)<br>
    I don't have to imagine. I know<br>
    how hard it's been. But, you'll<br>
    be surprised Data... feelings<br>
    do funny things. You may even<br>
    learn to understand your &quot;evil&quot;<br>
    brother... to forgive him. We<br>
    will be more alike, you and I.<br>
    You'll see. I'm happy for you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I question your sincerity, Lore.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (re: the chip)<br>
    Perhaps with this you'll learn<br>
    to be more trusting, Data. Your<br>
    brother has had good reason to<br>
    be bitter.</p>

    If there was only time left, I<br>
    could help you as well... what<br>

    The procedure is quite simple,<br>

    No. You'll need someone to care<br>
    for you. I will remain.</p>
  <p> Soong stares at Lore warmly, and then at Data.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    I need to rest now.</p>
  <p> Soong begins to leave the room.</p>

    May I assist you... with the<br>

  <p> Soong dismisses the offer with a wave of his hand.</p>

    It's a simple insertion... no need.</p>

    (interrupting)<br>
    Mister Data. We've got a very<br>
    sick boy on the Enterprise who's<br>
    not getting any better. And we're<br>
    dead in the water until you get<br>
    us out of here.</p>
  <p> Data hasn't the slightest idea of what Riker's talking<br>
    about.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (weakly, to Data)<br>
    It's all right. Access your third<br>
    nested memory file and execute<br>
    instruction five-one-five-five.<br>
    It will clear your memory block.</p>
  <p> Data twitches slightly as he executes the instruction.<br>
    His memory floods back and he recalls all he had<br>
    missed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    I was unaware of the inconvenience<br>
    I have caused, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'll discuss it later.<br>
    (turning to Soong)<br>
    You're coming, too, Doctor. You<br>
    need to get to Sickbay.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Brothers&quot; - REV. 7/19/90 - ACT FIVE 61A.</p>
  <p>54 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    No, no, no. I'll be fine.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    With all due respect, sir, you<br>
    don't look fine to me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Brothers&quot; - REV. 7/24/90 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>54 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    I've lived here a long time, young<br>
    man. I have no plans of dying<br>
    anywhere else.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But sir, our medical facility<br>
    could most likely...</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Go, Data. Go with your friends.</p>
  <p> Data walks to Riker.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (whispers)<br>
    May I say goodbye to Doctor Soong,<br>
    sir?</p>
  <p> Riker nods, but stays put.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (whispering)<br>
    Alone, sir?</p>
  <p> Riker motions to Worf and Geordi and they EXIT. Data<br>
    kneels by Soong.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    Everybody dies, Data.</p>
  <p> Data cocks his head and Soong modifies his statement.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (managing a slight<br>
    smile)<br>
    Well, almost everybody.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Do you believe... in some ways,<br>
    we are alike?</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    In many ways, I'd like to believe.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then it is alright for you to<br>
    die... because I will remain alive.</p>
  <p> Soong reaches out and touches Data's shoulder.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Brothers&quot; - REV. 7/25/90 - ACT FIVE 63.</p>
  <p>54 CONTINUED: (6)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You know I cannot grieve for you.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (smiles softly)<br>
    You will, in your own way.<br>
    Goodbye Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Goodbye.....Father.</p>
  <p>55 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise is docked at Starbase Four-One-Six.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 44149.1.<br>
    We have been at Starbase Four-One-Six<br>
    for three days. Young Willie<br>
    Potts is responding well to<br>
    treatment and has been returned<br>
    to the Enterprise.</p>
  <p>55A INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard and Beverly walk through the corridor on<br>
    their way to the quarantine area.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The transfer went well?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    He'll remain in quarantine for<br>
    another week or two, but he's out<br>
    of the woods.</p>
  <p>56 INT. SICKBAY - QUARANTINE AREA</p>
  <p> As Picard and Beverly ENTER the quarantine area, they<br>
    find Data watching Jake and Willie at a distance. Jake<br>
    sits at the window with his hands through the openings.<br>
    The brothers are playing with two model dinosaurs.<br>
    They argue for a moment, but then smile. Picard and<br>
    Beverly approach Data.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Brothers&quot; - 7/13/90 - ACT FIVE 64.</p>
  <p>56 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Captain. The boys appear<br>
    to have reconciled their<br>
    differences.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    They're brothers, Data. Brothers<br>
    forgive.</p>
  <p> We PUSH IN on Data as he turns his gaze from the boys<br>
    to Doctor Crusher, weighing her statement. He turns<br>
    his eyes back to the boys, as we:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
