  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse speed.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 44769.2.<br>
    For some weeks we have had a<br>
    Klingon exo-biologist on board<br>
    as part of a scientific exchange<br>
    program. Unfortunately, we<br>
    suspect that he may have been<br>
    involved not only in a security<br>
    breach but in the possible<br>
    sabotage of our warp drive.</p>
  <p>2 OMITTED</p>
  <p>3 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM</p>
  <p> as seen in &quot;The Defector.&quot; RIKER and TROI are<br>
    questioning; WORF stands by the door. In the hot seat<br>
    is a young Klingon civilian, J'DAN. He is wearing a<br>
    Starfleet communicator.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What were you doing accessing<br>
    the propulsion system files on<br>
    Stardate 44758?</p>
  <p> J'DAN<br>
    I didn't...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/15/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But you did... from computer<br>
    Twelve-B-Nine on Deck Thirty-six.</p>
  <p> A short beat as J'Dan looks surprised.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The computer logged in your<br>
    identification from your<br>
    communicator.</p>
  <p> J'DAN<br>
    It must be a mistake.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    J'Dan... we have confirmed<br>
    reports that schematic drawings<br>
    of our dilithium chamber fell<br>
    into Romulan hands... one week<br>
    later.</p>
  <p> J'DAN<br>
    I know nothing about it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And you don't know anything about<br>
    the explosion that disabled the<br>
    warp drive at almost the same<br>
    time?</p>
  <p> J'DAN<br>
    No. I was not involved. You<br>
    accuse me because I am Klingon.</p>
  <p> Troi shakes her head...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Our Chief Security Officer is<br>
    Klingon, J'Dan -- that has<br>
    nothing to do with it.</p>
  <p> J'DAN<br>
    Send me home, then, if you are<br>
    so distrusting.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've discussed that with the<br>
    Klingon High Council. You'll be<br>
    sent back... as soon as we've<br>
    finished our investigation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/12/91 - TEASER 2A.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> J'DAN<br>
    I have nothing more to say.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Very well. Mister Worf... please<br>
    accompany the Lieutenant to his<br>
    quarters.</p>
  <p> Worf comes forward and J'Dan rises. They EXIT. Riker<br>
    turns to Troi.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What do you think?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/12/91 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's hard to tell. He is very<br>
    closed... but...</p>
  <p> Troi is silent for a moment, tapping into her feelings.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He is hiding something.</p>
  <p>4 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Worf and J'Dan ride in silence for a bit. J'Dan<br>
    keeps sneaking looks at Worf, who stares straight<br>
    ahead.</p>
  <p> J'DAN<br>
    On the Klingon Home World... your<br>
    name is not mentioned... it is<br>
    as though you never existed.</p>
  <p> Worf shifts a little, impatiently, but makes no reply.</p>
  <p> J'DAN<br>
    A terrible burden for a warrior<br>
    to bear... to become nothing...<br>
    without honor... without the<br>
    chance for glory...</p>
  <p> The turbolift stops and the doors open. Worf exits<br>
    and turns to glare at J'Dan until he follows.</p>
  <p>5 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> The two proceed down a corridor.</p>
  <p> J'DAN<br>
    I have friends... powerful<br>
    friends... on the Home World.</p>
  <p> No answer.</p>
  <p> J'DAN<br>
    I could talk to them... they might<br>
    help to restore your name...</p>
  <p> Silence.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/15/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> J'DAN<br>
    If you could just take me to a<br>
    shuttlecraft...</p>
  <p> They have reached J'Dan's quarters. The doors open,<br>
    Worf gestures to J'Dan to precede him. There is a<br>
    hesitation, then they ENTER.</p>
  <p>6 INT. J'DAN'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> J'DAN<br>
    It could be done without any one<br>
    knowing --</p>
  <p> But suddenly, Worf has pulled some swift Klingon<br>
    martial arts move and J'Dan is thrown back against<br>
    the wall, with Worf pinning him solidly, nose-to-nose.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I do not know how you managed to<br>
    transfer secret information to the<br>
    Romulans... but I will find out.</p>
  <p> J'DAN<br>
    Pahtak -- !</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    And when we inform the Klingon<br>
    High Council, they will put you to<br>
    a slow death.</p>
  <p> He holds J'Dan against the wall for a fierce instant,<br>
    then releases him and EXITS.</p>
  <p>7 CLOSE ON J'DAN</p>
  <p> as he follows Worf's exit with a vitriolic look.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>8 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND SMALLER SHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A Federation craft hovers near the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Retired Admiral Norah Satie,<br>
    whose investigation exposed the<br>
    alien conspiracy against Starfleet<br>
    Command three years ago, is<br>
    arriving to assist in our<br>
    investigation.</p>
  <p>9 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD and Riker watch as a group MATERIALIZES on the<br>
    pad: SABIN GENESTRA, a Betazoid man; NELLEN TORE, a<br>
    female assistant, and ADMIRAL NORAH SATIE, retired.<br>
    She surveys the waiting group before her, finds Picard,<br>
    and smiles radiantly. Norah Satie is middle-aged, a<br>
    beautiful woman who has become more so with maturity.<br>
    She is gracious, elegant, and decidedly feminine. Her<br>
    smile is generous, bespeaking warmth and intelligence.<br>
    She moves toward Picard, hand extended.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Captain Picard...</p>
  <p> He takes her hand. The instinct is to kiss it -- she<br>
    evinces that kind of courtly behavior. But of course<br>
    that isn't Starfleet regulation, so Picard gives it a<br>
    proper grasp.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral Satie. Welcome to the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    I am delighted to be here.<br>
    (gesturing)<br>
    I've managed to acquire my former<br>
    staff... My aide, Sabin Genestra,<br>
    from Betazed, and my assistant,<br>
    Nellen Tore, from Delb Two.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/12/91 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And my First Officer, Commander<br>
    William Riker. May I show you<br>
    to your quarters?</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Captain... if Starfleet Command<br>
    is so concerned with your report<br>
    that they brought me out of<br>
    retirement... I think I should<br>
    get right to work.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well... Commander, will you<br>
    see to the Admiral's Staff?</p>
  <p> Riker turns to the others as --</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    First, I'd like to inspect the<br>
    damage to your Engine Room.</p>
  <p> And she heads for the door with Picard close at her<br>
    heels.</p>
  <p> 10 INT. ENGINEERING - A LITTLE LATER</p>
  <p> DATA and GEORDI oversee a scene which finds the section<br>
    isolation door between the dilithium chamber and the<br>
    pool table area closed. Behind the door there are<br>
    clouds of gas, and the hatch of the chamber has been<br>
    blown off.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We still can't get in there,<br>
    Captain. The radiation levels<br>
    are dropping, but they're too high<br>
    to raise the isolation door.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How much longer will it be?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    At the rate the levels have been<br>
    decreasing, we will be able to<br>
    gain entry in forty-nine hours.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe the Admiral would like to<br>
    see the visual log of the<br>
    explosion.</p>
  <p> Satie acknowledges. They move to a wall monitor and<br>
    Geordi punches in commands.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    This was logged four days ago...<br>
    at oh-three hundred hours.</p>
  <p>11 ANGLE - MONITOR (OPTICAL) - INTERCUTTING</p>
  <p> It is a video of the dilithium chamber... maybe a time<br>
    code in the corner... MOS... they wait... wait... and<br>
    then suddenly, the hatch to the chamber blows off and<br>
    across the room.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    At that point the emergency<br>
    confinement field was activated<br>
    and the isolation doors came<br>
    down. No one was killed, but<br>
    two of my people are in Sickbay<br>
    with radiation burns.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Have you been able to make any<br>
    preliminary assessments?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A slow-motion study of the<br>
    explosion suggests that the<br>
    articulation frame collapsed.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    The schematics that were stolen<br>
    from the Enterprise... I believe<br>
    some involved the articulation<br>
    frame of the dilithium chamber...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/12/91 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (acknowledging)<br>
    That is one reason we tend to<br>
    suspect sabotage.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Other evidence lends credence to<br>
    that theory, Captain. A review<br>
    of the sensor logs indicates that<br>
    every systems reading was well<br>
    within normal parameters until<br>
    fifty-two milliseconds before the<br>
    explosion.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We haven't found anything that<br>
    suggests there was a malfunction<br>
    anywhere along the line.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/12/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Satie turns toward Picard.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Captain Picard... I think I need<br>
    a full briefing before we go any<br>
    further.</p>
  <p> She looks through the isolation door at the grim<br>
    evidence of destruction.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Commander Data... La Forge... I'll<br>
    admit I'm glad I don't have to<br>
    do your job... good luck.</p>
  <p>12 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Worf ENTERS and approaches BEVERLY, who is examining<br>
    a patient on a bio-bed. He is swathed in wraps which<br>
    suggest burns. In the background is SIMON TARSES, a<br>
    mild-looking humanoid working at a monitor.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Excuse me, Doctor...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes, Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    When you have a moment... I must<br>
    ask you something...</p>
  <p> She turns to him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Good timing. I'm finished here...<br>
    Mister Tarses... ?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Tarses approaches from the monitor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Please enter these readings into<br>
    Ensign Dagget's file.</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    Yes, Doctor.</p>
  <p> He takes the tricorder and Beverly and Worf move off<br>
    together.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What is it, Worf?</p>
  <p> He shows her an object.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Did you issue this to J'Dan?</p>
  <p> Beverly takes the object, inspects it...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Looks like a micro-replicating<br>
    hyposyringe... but it's not<br>
    Starfleet issue...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It was found... in his quarters.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    J'Dan has Ba'ltmasor Syndrome...<br>
    he comes in regularly for<br>
    treatments... but we use our<br>
    own hyposprays. Is this one<br>
    Klingon?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes. Do you know what this<br>
    attachment is?</p>
  <p>13 INSERT - HYPOSYRINGE</p>
  <p> Worf indicates a small connection on the syringe.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>14 BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No... it's nothing we use...</p>
  <p> Worf seems satisfied with that answer.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Thank you, Doctor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (a bit puzzled)<br>
    I hope that helps.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You've told me exactly what I<br>
    wanted to hear.</p>
  <p> And he EXITS, as Beverly looks after him, perplexed.</p>
  <p>15 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard and Satie. The briefing has been continuing for<br>
    some time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There are disturbing overtones...<br>
    to the idea of a Klingon providing<br>
    information to the Romulans...</p>
  <p> She keeps her eyes on Picard, revealing nothing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you... aware... of any other<br>
    Romulan-Klingon connections that<br>
    Starfleet Command might have<br>
    encountered recently?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    (gently)<br>
    I don't believe... what Starfleet<br>
    Command knows or doesn't know is<br>
    for me to reveal.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This ship has had several<br>
    encounters which might suggest<br>
    a potential alliance between those<br>
    two powers --</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    We're aware of that, Captain.<br>
    What we must concentrate on is<br>
    the business at hand.</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> The doors open and Worf ENTERS, sees the Admiral,<br>
    stops.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Excuse me, Captain, I didn't know<br>
    --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Please come in Mister Worf. I<br>
    particularly want our guest to<br>
    meet you... Admiral Satie...<br>
    my head of security, Lieutenant<br>
    Worf.</p>
  <p> Nods of acknowledgment.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain... I have been pursuing<br>
    the investigation of Lieutenant<br>
    J'Dan. I believe I know how<br>
    he transferred information off<br>
    the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Good work, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (producing the syringe)<br>
    This is J'Dan's. It is fitted<br>
    with an optical reader...<br>
    specially modified to read data<br>
    from Starfleet isolinear chips.</p>
  <p> Satie takes the syringe and inspects it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He can extract digital information<br>
    from a computer... encode it in<br>
    the form of amino-acid sequences,<br>
    and transfer those sequences into<br>
    a fluid in the syringe... Then<br>
    he injects someone, perhaps even<br>
    without their knowledge...</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    (suggesting a<br>
    conspiracy)<br>
    Or perhaps with their knowledge...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The information would be carried<br>
    in their bloodstream in the form<br>
    of inert proteins.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    (shakes her head with<br>
    realization)<br>
    The body itself becomes a conveyor<br>
    of top-secret files...</p>
  <p> She turns toward Worf, obviously impressed.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Lieutenant Worf... when we<br>
    confront J'Dan, I want you to<br>
    conduct the interrogation.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I would be honored.</p>
  <p> Worf nods to the two and EXITS. Satie turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Captain... I predict that officer<br>
    will be extremely valuable in this<br>
    investigation.</p>
  <p> Picard has no reason to doubt it.</p>

  <p>16 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - SEVERAL DAYS LATER</p>
  <p> Arranged to accommodate more questioners: Satie and<br>
    Sabin, Picard and Worf. Off to one side sits Nellen,<br>
    constantly taking notes. J'Dan is once again in the<br>
    hot seat as Worf stands over him; they look like<br>
    they've been at it a while.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I tracked the movements of each<br>
    person who left the Enterprise<br>
    since you've been here. I traced<br>
    one Tarkanian diplomat as far as<br>
    the Cruces system... where he<br>
    disappeared and has not been seen<br>
    since.</p>
  <p> J'DAN<br>
    That proves nothing.</p>
  <p> Worf produces the syringe; J'Dan eyes it warily.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    This was found in your quarters.</p>
  <p> J'DAN<br>
    I take injections. Everyone knows<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But your injections don't require<br>
    an optical chip reader. This<br>
    device --<br>
    (points to it)<br>
    -- has only one function: to<br>
    transform computer information<br>
    into biological sequences.</p>
  <p> Worf has nailed him. J'Dan knows it now. No reason<br>
    to hold back now... he speaks with the fervor of a<br>
    patriot:</p>
  <p> J'DAN<br>
    The blood of all Klingons has<br>
    become water... since the<br>
    Federation alliance we have<br>
    become a nation of mewling<br>
    babies... The Romulans are<br>
    strong... they are worthy<br>
    allies... they do not turn<br>
    Klingons into weaklings --<br>
    (turns to Worf)<br>
    -- like you...</p>

  <p> Satie rises, crosses to J'Dan.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    How did you damage the dilithium<br>
    chamber?</p>
  <p> J'DAN<br>
    I had nothing to do with that --</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    No? You mean it was sheer<br>
    coincidence that it was sabotaged<br>
    after you gave the plans for its<br>
    design to the Romulans?</p>
  <p> J'DAN<br>
    I do not know. I had nothing to<br>
    do with it.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    You've admitted your crime. Why<br>
    lie now?</p>
  <p> J'DAN<br>
    I am not lying.</p>
  <p> She regards him calmly for a moment, then nods,<br>
    finished, to Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You may have him confined, Mister<br>
    Worf.</p>
  <p> Only too happy to do so, Worf leads J'Dan from the<br>
    room. Satie approaches Sabin.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Sabin?</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    I believe... he is telling the<br>
    truth.</p>

    He admits stealing the files...<br>
    but not sabotaging the dilithium<br>
    chamber. I get no sense that he<br>
    is lying.</p>
  <p> Picard considers the ramifications of this statement.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you're right... someone else<br>
    may be involved.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    I think, Captain... that you have<br>
    a bigger problem on your ship than<br>
    one Klingon Exchange Officer.</p>

  <p>17 INT. ENTERPRISE - ADMIRAL'S QUARTERS - LATER</p>
  <p> Picard with Norah. They have finished an informal<br>
    supper; she rises and brings a tray of coffee things;<br>
    during the next, she pours for them and twists a rind<br>
    of lemon into her own. She looks lovely tonight...<br>
    fragile and delicate, like a piece of porcelain. She<br>
    is a woman who has the capacity to be both forceful<br>
    and vulnerable.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    I've seen this before. The<br>
    spectre of conspiracy on a<br>
    starship is a frightening one.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's hard for me to believe...<br>
    but I am grateful for your<br>
    presence, Admiral. If anyone in<br>
    Starfleet can help us, it's you.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Captain Picard... I find myself<br>
    changing my mind about you...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In what way... ?</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    When Starfleet ordered me here...<br>
    it was with the express command<br>
    that we work together on this<br>
    problem... as equals...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    My father taught me to avoid<br>
    partnerships... most of them are<br>
    woefully lop-sided.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    That sounds like Judge Aaron<br>
    Satie...</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    You knew my father?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Through his writing. His judicial<br>
    decisions were required reading<br>
    at the Academy.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    He was an extraordinary man.<br>
    Every night at the dinner table...<br>
    he'd pose a question for debate.<br>
    My big brothers and I would<br>
    wrangle it around, from one side<br>
    and the other... my father would<br>
    referee... he kept a stopwatch<br>
    on us so we'd have to learn<br>
    brevity... and he wouldn't let<br>
    us leave until he thought we had<br>
    completely explored the issue...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm willing to wager you trounced<br>
    your brothers in those debates...</p>
  <p> She laughs delightedly.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    More than once. Father would love<br>
    it when I nailed one of them on<br>
    some subtle point of logic...<br>
    (beat, sobering)<br>
    All that I am, I owe to him. He<br>
    was... a giant...</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    You must miss him very much.</p>
  <p> She looks quickly at him, his words striking at her<br>
    rawest place. Unaccustomed tears threaten to sting<br>
    her eyes, and she rises quickly, clearing the dishes,<br>
    changing the subject.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    I like your Mister Worf. Very<br>
    direct, to the point. The two<br>
    of you make a good combination.</p>
  <p> Having regained composure, she slips back into her<br>
    seat, looks him in the eye.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Captain... I've always preferred<br>
    working alone.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    That way, if something goes wrong,<br>
    I don't have to look far for the<br>
    cause.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I resented your being assigned<br>
    to me. But... I was wrong. We're<br>
    going to make quite a team.</p>
  <p> The warmth of her smile is infectious. Picard returns<br>
    it.</p>

  <p> Worf showing Sabin the ship's roster...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    J'Dan did not make friends<br>

    question...</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>

    You've done a thorough job,<br>
    Lieutenant.</p>

  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am strongly motivated in this<br>
    matter.</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    (nods thoughtfully)<br>
    Yes. I can see that. And I don't<br>
    mind telling you I'm surprised.<br>
    Frankly, when I first heard about<br>
    your father...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (stiffens)<br>
    My father...</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    ...yes... There are some who<br>
    believe he betrayed your people<br>
    to the Romulans...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    My father... what he did or did<br>
    not do... is no one's concern but<br>
    my own...</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    (soothing)<br>
    Of course. Of course. I only<br>
    meant... before I saw you in<br>
    action, I naturally considered<br>
    you a possible security risk...<br>
    but I want you to know you have<br>
    the Admiral's and my complete<br>
    confidence. You have nothing to<br>
    prove to us.</p>
  <p> He means exactly the opposite of what he's saying.<br>
    Sabin wants Worf to feel that he has to be even more<br>
    'patriotic' than anyone by rooting out the enemy.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    If there is a conspiracy on board,<br>
    I promise you I will find it...</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    Good. You know the ship, you know<br>
    the personnel... you know exactly<br>
    what we're up against... we're<br>
    counting on you, Lieutenant.</p>

    pleased with the way that went.</p>
  <p>19 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - SEVERAL DAYS LATER</p>

    About once a week.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Did you administer them yourself?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No. One of my assistants did<br>
    that...</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    Did you ever hear him say<br>
    anything... anything that might<br>
    have seemed innocent at the<br>
    time... that might now shed any<br>
    light on this investigation?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No, nothing. In fact, he rarely<br>
    talked at all.</p>
  <p> Satie nods, that's all.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you, Doctor Crusher, we<br>
    appreciate your time. You are<br>
    excused now. Mister Worf, will<br>
    you bring in the next person?</p>
  <p> Beverly gets up, and Worf escorts her to the door; she<br>
    EXITS, and Worf admits Simon Tarses.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Please sit down, Mister Tarses.<br>
    For the record, will you state<br>
    your name and position?</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    Simon Tarses, Crewman First Class,<br>
    medical technician.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I assure you this is an informal<br>
    inquiry... we're not accusing you<br>
    of anything. However, if you want<br>
    counsel, it will be provided for<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> Tarses sits, looking around nervously. It's clear he<br>
    is pretty shook up about this.</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    No, sir... I have nothing to hide.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. How long have you held<br>
    your appointment on the<br>
    Enterprise?</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    Since... Stardate 43587.<br>
    Eight-eight...</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    (studying a Padd)<br>
    Mister Tarses... your records<br>
    state that you were born on Mars<br>
    Colony...</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    That's right.</p>

  <p>19 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Then you are human?</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    Largely. My paternal grandfather<br>
    was Vulcan.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Yes, I see that here. Tell me...<br>
    what is your relationship to the<br>
    Klingon, J'Dan?</p>
  <p> Tarses looks uncomfortable at this question, and<br>
    becomes more nervous.</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    I... he... I mean, there's no<br>
    relationship... he just came in<br>
    for his injections...</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Did you give him those injections?</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    Sometimes. There were several<br>
    of us, actually... I might have<br>
    done it twice...</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    Did you ever hear him make any<br>
    comments that might, in<br>
    retrospect, be suspicious?</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    Not really. He hardly talked.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Did you ever see him outside<br>
    Sickbay?</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    Once or twice in Ten-Forward...<br>
    with a group of people. I never<br>
    had a conversation with him.</p>

  <p> SABIN<br>
    He's desperately frightened...<br>
    he's covering something.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It was clear he was frightened,<br>
    but that's hardly an indication<br>
    --</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    It's more than that. He wasn't<br>
    truthful. He's covering a lie...<br>
    one so big it's overwhelming him.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not sure I can sanction any<br>
    action against Mister Tarses based<br>
    solely on Betazoid intuitions.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Sabin has uncanny instincts. I've<br>
    learned to trust them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I must admit... that I'm a bit<br>
    uneasy with this use of a<br>
    Betazoid.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    You have a Betazoid counselor...<br>
    surely you are aware of the<br>
    advantages.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There is a difference between a<br>
    counselor... and an investigator.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Are you saying you never use your<br>
    counselor during interrogations?</p>
  <p> Of course, he does. He is forced to think about this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I do... but I don't act on the<br>
    basis of her instincts alone.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Nor do I.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're asking me to restrict<br>

    If Counselor Troi suggested to<br>

    his activity?</p>
  <p> Picard confronts this. He's not sure he likes what he<br>
    sees.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have to admit I probably would.<br>
    And maybe I should re-evaluate<br>
    that behavior.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Nonsense. Let's keep our<br>
    priorities straight... the<br>
    important thing is to uncover the<br>
    conspiracy on this ship... and<br>
    to prevent further damage. If<br>
    Tarses is a possible saboteur,<br>
    you cannot allow him access to<br>
    the sensitive areas of the ship.<br>
    And... I strongly suggest<br>
    continuous surveillance.</p>
  <p> Picard paces, wrestles with this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If we had better evidence...</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    We will have better evidence...<br>
    Sabin and Worf are continuing to<br>

    act until then... it may be too<br>
    late.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (he's sure now)<br>
    No. I won't treat a man as a<br>
    criminal unless there is probable<br>
    cause to do so.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    And while you're being so<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Those fractures suggest nothing<br>
    more than simple neutron fatigue.<br>
    I would speculate that when the<br>
    engine was last inspected at<br>
    McKinley station, the hatch casing<br>
    was replaced with one which had<br>
    an undetectable defect.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    I think, sir, that the conclusion<br>
    of our investigation must be that<br>
    the explosion was not<br>
    intentional.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's the way I see it. This<br>
    wasn't sabotage at all... it was<br>
    nothing more than an accident.</p>
  <p> Picard is surprised, but relieved. However, Admiral<br>
    Satie's reaction seems tinged with disappointment.</p>
  <p>23 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Satie, Worf, and Sabin. And Nellen, of course.</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    An accident? I find that hard<br>
    to believe...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If my men say there was no<br>
    sabotage, you can be sure there<br>
    was none.</p>
  <p> There is a little click of the Padd, or a shift on the<br>
    chair by Nellen, and Picard shoots a glance toward her.<br>
    She is getting on his nerves.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Let's keep our perspective,<br>
    gentlemen. Just because there<br>
    was no sabotage doesn't mean<br>
    there's not a conspiracy on this<br>
    ship. We do have a confessed spy.</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    And he had confederates.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do we know that for sure?</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Of course he did.</p>
  <p> She moves closer to Picard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/13/91 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Do you think J'Dan could have<br>
    come on board the flagship of the<br>
    Federation and done all that he<br>
    did without help?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It would be difficult... but not<br>
    impossible...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We must continue to investigate<br>
    Tarses. He was hiding something.</p>
  <p> Picard gives him a look... he realizes Worf is solidly<br>
    behind Satie and Sabin in this.</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    Captain Picard... Lieutenant Worf<br>
    and I are working well together.<br>
    I suggest we continue... if for<br>
    no other purpose than to determine<br>
    Tarses' innocence.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I remind you all... that Tarses<br>
    is innocent... until he is proven<br>
    guilty.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    (smoothly)<br>
    Of course he is. What Sabin is<br>
    saying is that he and Lieutenant<br>
    Worf would like to establish<br>
    Tarses' innocence<br>
    unequivocally... for his own sake.</p>
  <p> Picard can certainly see the wisdom in this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. But I hope we can put<br>
    the matter to rest as quickly as<br>
    possible.</p>
  <p>24 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - A DAY LATER</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS to find Satie, Sabin, and Worf already<br>
    seated at the front table; Tarses in the witness' seat,<br>
    and next to him sits Riker.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/7/91 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> To Picard's surprise, there is a small gathering of<br>
    spectators in the rear of the room (which includes<br>
    Beverly). He moves to his seat, addresses Satie<br>
    quietly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You've opened the hearing to<br>
    spectators?</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    (also sotto)<br>
    It isn't good to have closed-door<br>
    proceedings for too long... it<br>
    invites rumor and speculation.</p>
  <p> Picard nods; this makes sense.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Besides... spies and saboteurs<br>
    don't like the bright light of<br>
    public inquiry. They're like<br>
    roaches, scuttling for the dark<br>
    corners...</p>
  <p> With this, she turns away and begins talking to Sabin.<br>
    Picard is disquieted, and feeling more and more<br>
    uncomfortable about the whole thing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This hearing is convened on<br>
    Stardate 44740 as a continuing<br>
    inquiry into the activities of<br>
    Crewman Simon Tarses.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Mister Tarses... for your own<br>
    protection, I have assigned you<br>
    counsel in the person of Commander<br>
    William Riker.</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    Begging your pardon, sir... I<br>
    appreciate it, but... I don't need<br>
    protection. I haven't done<br>
    anything wrong.</p>
  <p> In the back of the room, Beverly stands.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    With the Captain's permission,<br>
    I would like to make a statement.</p>
  <p> Satie is not too thrilled by this.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/13/91 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    This is irregular. Let's stick<br>
    to procedure, here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's not irregular to have a<br>
    statement read into the record.<br>
    This is a hearing, not a trial.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor, you may come forward.</p>
  <p> Satie gives Picard a look, but controls her reaction<br>
    to the rebuff. Beverly comes to the front of the room;<br>
    she catches Tarses' eye for a brief moment, and smiles<br>
    sympathetically at him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Thank you. I would like to go<br>
    on record as saying that I have<br>
    worked with Crewman Tarses for<br>
    eighteen months. His work has<br>
    been exemplary. He is a model<br>
    of diligence and reliability.<br>
    He is devoted to Starfleet and<br>
    as far as I'm concerned, his<br>
    loyalty is without question.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    There's no way this man is a<br>
    traitor.</p>
  <p> She glances down at him and he looks up at her with<br>
    gratitude.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Thank you for letting me speak.</p>
  <p> She turns to go back to her seat, but --</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Doctor Crusher...<br>
    (she turns back)<br>
    Did you ever observe Crewman<br>
    Tarses with J'Dan...</p>
  <p> Beverly looks shocked by this question.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well, yes... he came in for<br>
    injections --</p>

  <p>24 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    I mean outside Sickbay.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (after a beat)<br>
    I think so... maybe in<br>
    Ten-Forward...</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    And whom else did you observe at<br>
    these occasions, Doctor?</p>
  <p> Now Beverly really hesitates. She doesn't like the<br>
    course this questioning is taking.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't see what relevance that<br>
    has here -- it was an innocent<br>
    social gathering...</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    If it was innocent, why would you<br>
    hesitate to give us the names?</p>
  <p> This is enough for Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you, Doctor Crusher. You<br>
    are excused.</p>
  <p> Satie turns toward him, ticked, and they have another<br>
    sotto conversation:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral Satie... if you have a<br>
    case to make against Tarses, you<br>
    had better make it. Or I am<br>
    calling this off here and now.</p>
  <p> Her cheeks flame, but she turns toward Sabin, nods. It<br>
    is like slipping the noose from a hungry panther.</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    Mister Tarses. Isn't it true that<br>
    you have had access to the<br>
    biological supplies in Sickbay?</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    That's part of my job, yes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT THREE 37.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    J'Dan used deoxyribose<br>
    suspensions to carry the encoded<br>
    files he stole. Isn't it true<br>
    that one of your duties is to<br>
    prepare those suspensions?</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    Several technicians share that<br>
    job...</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    And isn't it true that your<br>
    security clearance gives you<br>
    access to all the stores and files<br>
    in Sickbay -- access which you<br>
    can exercise at any time?</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    Because I have access doesn't mean<br>
    I --</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    What would you say if I told you<br>
    there is evidence that the<br>
    explosion in the engine room<br>
    was caused by a corrosive<br>
    chemical... one that is kept<br>
    stored in Sickbay.</p>
  <p> Picard's head whips around to Satie, but she looks<br>
    straight ahead.</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    I had nothing to do with it --</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    How can we believe you? How can<br>
    we possibly believe someone whom<br>
    we know... we know... to be a<br>
    liar?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I object, sir... There is no<br>
    basis for calling Officer Tarses<br>
    a liar.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (angry)<br>
    Agreed. Mister Sabin...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT THREE 38.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    Captain, there is a basis which<br>
    will be clear in a moment.<br>
    Mister Tarses, isn't it true that<br>
    you deliberately and<br>
    premeditatively lied when you<br>
    filled out your personnel<br>
    application and compounded that<br>
    lie by repeating it to this<br>
    committee?</p>
  <p> Tarses is ashen.</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    What -- ?</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    Isn't - it - true... that the<br>
    paternal grandfather of whom you<br>
    speak was not Vulcan... but was<br>
    in fact a Romulan? That it is<br>
    Romulan blood you carry... and<br>
    a Romulan heritage that you honor?</p>
  <p> There is a buzz in the audience. Tarses, pale, stares<br>
    at Sabin. Riker leans in and whispers in his ear.<br>
    Tarses has to force his attention away from Sabin,<br>
    concentrate on what Riker is saying.</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    We're waiting, Mister Tarses.</p>
  <p> Tarses turns away from Riker, looks back at the table.</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    On the advice of my counsel...<br>
    I refuse to answer the question...<br>
    in that... the answer... may<br>
    serve... to incriminate me.</p>
  <p> He slumps, anguished, in his chair.</p>
  <p>25 ON PICARD</p>
  <p> stunned by this development... and by the ugly turn he<br>
    has seen take place in the conduct of this hearing.</p>

  <p> ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>26 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard exits a turbolift and almost immediately an<br>
    Ensign, having exited the Observation Lounge, hurries<br>
    along the corridor past him. Picard continues toward<br>
    the Lounge when the doors open and another Ensign comes<br>
    hurrying out and toward the turbolift. Picard pauses<br>
    to look after him and right away another one comes out.<br>
    Puzzled, Picard ENTERS the Observation Lounge.</p>
  <p>27 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS to find Worf there, at the head of the<br>
    table; several crew members stand near him, carrying<br>
    Padds.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Ensign Bailey, you and Crewman<br>
    Marcus will coordinate to track<br>
    Tarses' movements for the last<br>
    five years. Ensign Kellogg, I<br>
    want a list of all his<br>
    relatives... his known<br>
    associates... especially old<br>
    school friends...</p>
  <p> The crew persons are taking notes frantically.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    And make arrangements to do an<br>
    encephalographic polygraph scan...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I need to speak with you.</p>
  <p> Worf hesitates, understands that he means &quot;alone,&quot; and<br>
    turns to the crew.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/7/91 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You are dismissed. Please get<br>
    your reports to me as soon as<br>
    possible.</p>
  <p> They disperse and Picard moves toward Worf.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is going on here?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain... I am conducting the<br>
    investigation of Simon Tarses.</p>
  <p> Picard regards him solemnly, moves to the window.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What has happened to us, Mister<br>
    Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think... we're putting on a<br>
    drumhead trial...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I don't understand...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Five hundred years ago military<br>
    officers would upend a drum on<br>
    the battlefield... sit at it and<br>
    dispense summary justice...<br>
    decisions were quick...<br>
    punishments severe... appeals<br>
    denied. Those who came to a<br>
    drumhead were doomed.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But... we know there is a traitor<br>
    here. J'Dan has admitted his<br>
    guilt.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's true. And he will stand<br>
    for his crimes.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Tarses has all but done the same.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/13/91 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (a sharp look)<br>
    How?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He refused to answer the<br>
    question... about his Romulan<br>
    grandfather.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That is not a crime, Worf. Nor<br>
    can we infer his guilt because<br>
    he did not respond.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    If a man is not afraid of the<br>
    truth, he would answer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. We must not let ourselves<br>
    think that. The Seventh Guarantee<br>
    is one of the most important<br>
    rights granted by the Federation.<br>
    We cannot use one of the<br>
    fundamental principles of our<br>
    Constitution and turn it against<br>
    a citizen.</p>
  <p> Worf is struggling to understand.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir... the Federation does have<br>
    enemies... we must seek them<br>
    out...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes... that's how it starts. But<br>
    the road from legitimate suspicion<br>
    to rampant paranoia is shorter<br>
    than we might think. Something<br>
    is wrong here, Worf... I don't<br>
    like what we have become.</p>
  <p> Worf regards him, much more uncertain now as to his<br>
    course.</p>

  <p>28 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Picard carries tea to a seated Simon Tarses, who is<br>
    almost as uneasy about a visit to the Captain's<br>
    quarters as he is about his predicament.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Here you are, Mister Tarses...<br>
    do you care for lemon?</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    No, thank you, sir. This is fine.</p>
  <p> Picard settles into a chair opposite, smiles at Tarses.<br>
    He wants to put the young man at ease.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/13/91 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tell me a little about yourself,<br>
    Crewman... I know you were born<br>
    on Mars Colony...</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    Yes, sir... All my life I wanted<br>
    to be in Starfleet. I went to<br>
    the Academy's program for enlisted<br>
    personnel... took training as a<br>
    medical technician... served at<br>
    several outposts... and the day<br>
    I was posted to the Enterprise<br>
    was the happiest day of my life.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Did you ever consider applying<br>
    to the Academy... going the whole<br>
    route and becoming an officer?</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    My parents wanted me to... and<br>
    I thought about it... I used to<br>
    sit under this big tree near the<br>
    parade grounds...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    An elm tree? With a circular<br>
    bench?</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    That's the one...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I spent many an hour there. It<br>
    was my favorite spot to study.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Drumhead&quot; - REV. 2/13/91 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    I used to sit... and watch the<br>
    drills... and picture myself an<br>
    officer. I knew it would make<br>
    my mother happy...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But you didn't do it.</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    No... I was eighteen, and eager...<br>
    the last thing I wanted to do was<br>
    spend four years sitting in<br>
    classrooms... I wanted to be out<br>
    there... traveling the stars...<br>
    I didn't want to wait for<br>
    anything...</p>
  <p> He's lost himself for a moment, remembering his<br>
    youthful eagerness... then, it catches up to him<br>
    again... this nightmare that he's living now... he<br>
    turns to Picard in distress.</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    And now... it's done, isn't it?<br>
    My career in Starfleet is<br>
    finished...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not if you aren't guilty.</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    It doesn't matter. I lied on my<br>
    application... and that mistake<br>
    will be with me for the rest of<br>
    my life.</p>
  <p> He shakes his head, abject and defeated.</p>

  <p>28 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TARSES<br>
    I couldn't wait to get started...<br>
    and now it's over...</p>
  <p> Picard regards him with sympathy... but there's little<br>
    he can say to argue.</p>
  <p>29 INT. CORRIDOR - A LITTLE LATER</p>
  <p> Satie and Nellen hurry along, the Admiral dictating and<br>
    Nellen tapping furiously.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Mister Worf has found a brother<br>
    who still lives on Mars Colony...<br>
    contact someone there and have<br>
    him interviewed...</p>
  <p> Picard hails them from behind.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral Satie...</p>
  <p> Satie turns her head and sees him, but keeps walking<br>
    and completes her thought to Nellen.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    ... and start a background check<br>
    into all his friends from the<br>
    Academy training program.</p>
  <p> Picard has now caught up to them.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Yes, Captain?</p>
  <p> The three come to a halt in the corridor. Picard<br>
    glances at Nellen, who is still tapping, but addresses<br>
    Satie.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'd like to talk to you.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> She stands, waiting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In private...</p>

    Pointedly, he reaches out and takes Nellen's Padd.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... and off the record.</p>
  <p> Satie is momentarily startled, but her aplomb is always<br>
    at her fingertips.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Of course, Captain.<br>
    (beat; smoothly)<br>
    After all... you are my partner<br>
    in this.</p>
  <p> And she turns and heads toward a turbolift; he follows.</p>
  <p>30 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Satie is staring at Picard as though he had gone mad.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    I cannot possibly believe you mean<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But I do. This must stop. It's<br>
    gone too far... you lied to him<br>
    about the Engine Room -- there<br>
    was no volatile chemical found<br>
    there...</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    It's just a tactic... a way of<br>
    applying pressure.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are hounding an innocent man.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    And how, may I ask, have you<br>
    managed to determine that?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I talked with him.</p>
  <p> A soft breath escapes her... short of a laugh but full<br>
    of derision.</p>

  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    I see. And he told you he was<br>
    a victim of circumstance...<br>
    blameless and pure...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No... he admits his mistake in<br>
    falsifying his application... but<br>
    that doesn't make him a traitor.</p>
  <p> She stares at him, smiling a bit, shaking her head in<br>
    wonder.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Can you be so incredibly<br>
    naive... ?</p>
  <p> She circles toward him, speaking gently, as though<br>
    talking to a child.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Captain... do you know how I have<br>
    spent the last four years?<br>
    Traveling from planet to Starbase<br>
    to planet...</p>
  <p> She moves away again, into her restless pacing.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    I have no home... I live on<br>
    starships and shuttlecraft... I<br>
    haven't seen a family member in<br>
    years... I have no friends.</p>
  <p> She turns back to him.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    But I have a purpose. My father<br>
    taught me... from the time I was<br>
    a little girl still clutching a<br>
    blanket... that the United<br>
    Federation of Planets is the most<br>
    remarkable institution ever<br>
    conceived. It is my cause to make<br>
    sure that this extraordinary union<br>
    is preserved...</p>
  <p> She moves closer to him.</p>

  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    I cannot imagine why you are<br>
    suddenly trying to block this<br>

    others, in the past, who got in<br>
    my way. They came to regret it.</p>

    The hearings on Simon Tarses must<br>
    stop. If necessary, I will go<br>
    to Starfleet Command.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Captain, I have news for you...<br>
    I've been in constant contact with<br>
    Starfleet Command. And the<br>
    hearings aren't going to stop --<br>
    they're going to be expanded.</p>
  <p> Picard is taken aback.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What are you saying -- ?</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    I am going to get to the heart<br>
    of this conspiracy... if it means<br>
    investigating every last person<br>
    on this ship.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And every hearing from now on<br>
    will be held in the presence of<br>
    Admiral Thomas Henry of Starfleet<br>
    Security. I've requested that<br>
    he be brought here at once...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You never told me about this --</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    I report directly to Starfleet<br>
    Command. I do not require your<br>
    permission or your approval for<br>
    my decisions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral... what you're doing<br>
    here... is unethical... it's<br>
    immoral... and I will fight it.</p>
  <p> Her eyes all but crackle. She moves toward him.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Do what you must, Captain. And<br>
    so will I.</p>
  <p> She turns and EXITS without another word. Picard is<br>
    deeply unsettled by what has happened.</p>

    Captain, the warp engines are back<br>

  <p> No answer from Picard. Data turns around to him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (snapping out of it)<br>
    Yes... ? Oh... yes, Mister Data.<br>
    Proceed.</p>
  <p> Riker leans toward him. Above, the turbolift door<br>
    OPENS.</p>
  <p> PIKER<br>
    Are you all right, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, of course. Just a bit --<br>
    preoccupied.</p>
  <p> And now Nellen rounds the ramp and approaches Picard,<br>
    hands him a Padd. He takes it, puzzled.</p>
  <p> NELLEN<br>

    You are to be questioned before<br>

    is a palpable sense of triumph.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>31 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM</p>
  <p> Now, there are more people in the gallery, including a<br>
    greying Starfleet Admiral. At the head table are only<br>
    Satie and Sabin. Worf is in the audience. And, in<br>
    the hot seat -- Picard.</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    Your full name?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jean-Luc Picard.</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    Rank and position?</p>

    Captain, Federation Starship<br>

  <p> SABIN<br>
    How long have you held that post?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Over three years. Since Stardate<br>
    41140.</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    Very well.<br>
    (turns to Satie)<br>
    Admiral?</p>
  <p> But before she can begin questioning --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you don't mind... I would like<br>
    to address the committee.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    If you have a statement, you'll<br>
    get an opportunity to make it<br>
    later --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I believe that Chapter Four,<br>
    Article Twelve of the Uniform Code<br>
    of Justice grants me the right<br>
    to make a statement before<br>
    questioning begins...</p>

  <p> She stares icily at him, but knows he is right.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Very well.</p>
  <p> Picard rises and approaches the head table. His manner<br>
    is soothing... clearly he's trying to calm things down,<br>
    not inflame them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am deeply concerned by what is<br>
    happening here. It began when<br>
    we apprehended a spy, a man who<br>
    admitted his guilt and who will<br>
    answer for his crime. But the<br>
    hunt didn't stop there. Another<br>
    man, Simon Tarses, was brought<br>
    to trial -- and it was a trial,<br>
    no matter what others may call<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> He pauses, picking his way carefully through this mine<br>
    field.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Unfortunately, it was a trial<br>
    based on insinuation and innuendo.<br>
    Nothing substantive against<br>
    Crewman Tarses was offered, much<br>
    less proven.</p>
  <p> He walks toward Tarses, who sits in the audience.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This man has a Romulan<br>
    grandfather. For that, his career<br>
    stands in ruins. Have we become<br>
    so fearful? Have we become so<br>
    cowardly that we must extinguish<br>
    a man because he carries the blood<br>
    of a current enemy?</p>
  <p> He paces back and forth in front of the table.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I remind you... we are not<br>
    descended from cowardly people.<br>
    We come from those who were<br>
    willing to think the unthinkable,<br>
    speak the unspeakable...<br>

    ... and to defend with passion<br>
    ideas and causes which were, at<br>
    the moment, unpopular.</p>
  <p> He moves toward Satie, a final, urgent plea.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral, let us not condemn Simon<br>
    Tarses or anyone else on the basis<br>
    of half-truth. I implore you...<br>
    do not continue with this<br>
    proceeding. End it here.</p>
  <p> He returns to his seat. The Starfleet Admiral waits<br>
    with a grim, thoughtful look on his face. Sabin turns<br>
    to Norah, who is looking down, fiddling with a Padd,<br>
    making little notations, seemingly unaffected by<br>
    Picard's words.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    (beat; still looking<br>
    down, soft and calm)<br>
    Captain Picard... do you believe<br>
    in the Prime Directive?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    In fact, it is Starfleet General<br>
    Order Number One, isn't it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your point, Admiral... ?</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    (now she looks at him)<br>
    Would it surprise you to learn<br>
    that you have violated the Prime<br>
    Directive a total of nine times<br>
    since you took command of the<br>
    Enterprise?<br>
    (without allowing him<br>
    to answer)<br>
    I must say, Captain, it surprised<br>
    the hell out of me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My reports to Starfleet document<br>
    the circumstances in each of those<br>
    instances --</p>

  <p>31 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Yes, we're looking into those<br>
    reports, Captain, very closely<br>
    into those reports... after which<br>
    I'm sure we'll have more questions<br>
    for you about your so-called<br>
    commitment to Starfleet's Prime<br>
    Directive.</p>
  <p> She glances at the Starfleet Admiral for approval...<br>
    she doesn't get it. He's waiting to see where this<br>
    goes. He looks at her evenly as...</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    Captain, could you explain just<br>
    what happened on Stardate 44390?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Excuse me?</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    Let me refresh your memory. You<br>
    were transporting a Vulcan<br>
    ambassador... T'Pel...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was following orders to deliver<br>
    the ambassador to a destination<br>
    near the Neutral Zone, and --</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    I don't think we need the<br>
    preamble.</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    In fact, she was not a Vulcan at<br>
    all, was she? She was a Romulan<br>
    spy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's correct.</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    A spy whom you delivered back<br>
    into the hands of the enemy.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Tell me, Captain... when the<br>
    deception was revealed... and she<br>
    stood proudly on the Bridge of<br>
    a Romulan ship... did you make<br>
    any effort to retrieve her?</p>

  <p>31 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    No? Even though you knew she<br>
    carried Federation secrets she<br>
    had been accumulating for years?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There was no chance of getting<br>
    her back. We were deep in Romulan<br>
    space. The safety of my crew was<br>
    my primary concern.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (rises to defend Picard)<br>
    The Enterprise could have been<br>
    captured by Romulans... Captain<br>
    Picard did the only thing he could.</p>
  <p> Satie turns to him, stunned and furious at his<br>
    perfidy.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Really, Lieutenant? And where<br>
    were you while this traitor was<br>
    on board the Enterprise? Where<br>
    was ship's security?</p>
  <p> SABIN<br>
    Wouldn't you say it is<br>
    questionable judgment, Captain,<br>
    to have a security officer whose<br>
    father was a Romulan<br>
    collaborator?</p>
  <p> Worf rises... begins to move toward the podium.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> Worf stops, sits. Satie continues to glance at the<br>
    Starfleet Admiral who looks increasingly uncomfortable<br>
    and unconvinced by Satie's argument. She moves to<br>
    her biggest gun...</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Captain Picard... have you fully<br>
    recovered from your experience<br>
    with the Borg?</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. I am fully recovered.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    It must have been awful...<br>
    actually becoming one of them...<br>
    being forced to use your vast<br>
    knowledge of Starfleet operations<br>
    to aid the Borg...</p>
  <p> Picard has assumed a tight masque. Satie, carrying<br>
    her Padd, moves in the general direction of the<br>
    visiting Starfleet Admiral, playing to him but not<br>
    being obvious about it.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    Just how many of our ships were<br>
    destroyed?<br>
    (checks Padd)<br>
    ...ah. I have it...<br>
    thirty-nine... with the loss of<br>
    life measured at nearly eleven<br>
    thousand...</p>
  <p> She pauses to let this sink in. There is a stirring<br>
    among the audience. She looks toward the Admiral,<br>
    begins talking about Picard in the third person.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    One wonders how this man can sleep<br>
    at night... having caused so much<br>
    destruction...</p>

  <p> ADMIRAL SATIE<br>
    I question your actions,<br>
    Captain... I question your<br>
    choices... I question your<br>
    loyalty...</p>
  <p> She glares at the Admiral, who looks down at the floor.<br>
    He's finding this harder and harder to endure. There<br>
    is a small silence, and Picard's voice fills it,<br>
    speaking softly but in a tone that commands attention.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There is a saying... which many<br>
    of us have heard since we were<br>
    school children... &quot;With the first<br>
    link, the chain is forged. The<br>
    first speech censured, the first<br>
    thought forbidden, the first<br>
    freedom denied -- chains us all,<br>
    irrevocably.&quot;</p>
  <p> Two bright spots have appeared on Norah Satie's cheeks.<br>
    Her eyes burn into Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Those words were uttered by Judge<br>
    Aaron Satie -- as wisdom and<br>
    warning. The very first time any<br>
    man's freedoms are trampled...<br>
    we are all damaged.<br>

    father's name to support your<br>
    traitorous arguments... It is<br>

    sculpture, hands folded neatly on the table, back<br>
    erect, eyes focused right in front of her. The room is<br>
