    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> At impulse.</p>
  <p>2 CLOSEUP ON A GHASTLY TRANSPARENT WHITE FIGURE IN<br>
    CHAINS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> MARLEY<br>
    You don't believe in me.</p>
  <p> Pulling back to see DATA dressed in Dickensian clothes<br>
    as the terrified Ebenezer Scrooge... the set is<br>
    Scrooge's classic Victorian bedroom.</p>
  <p> DATA/SCROOGE<br>
    I don't.</p>
  <p> MARLEY<br>
    What evidence would you have of<br>
    my reality beyond that of your<br>
    senses?</p>
  <p> DATA/SCROOGE<br>
    I don't know.</p>
  <p> MARLEY<br>
    Why do you doubt your senses?</p>
  <p> DATA/SCROOGE<br>
    Because a little thing affects<br>
    them. A slight disorder of the<br>
    stomach makes them cheats. You<br>
    may be an undigested bit of beef,<br>
    a blot of mustard, a crumb of<br>
    cheese, a fragment of an underdone<br>
    potato. There's more of gravy<br>
    than of grave about you, whatever<br>
    you are. Humbug, I tell you<br>
    humbug!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Devil's Due&quot; - REV. 11/5/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 INT. HOLODECK - ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> to reveal PICARD observing... The spirit raises a<br>
    frightful cry and shakes its chain making an appalling<br>
    noise and Data/Scrooge falls upon his knees, clasps his<br>
    hands in fear before his face.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Freeze program.</p>
  <p> As Marley freezes...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very nicely done, Data... your<br>
    performance skills really are<br>
    improving...</p>
  <p> Data shakes his head, doesn't agree... is dubious about<br>
    his performance. He stands... turns to Picard...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have taken your advice, Captain.<br>
    This time I have not imitated<br>
    another actor's rendition. It<br>
    was my own interpretation...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And a very interesting one...<br>
    you should be congratulated...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Your courtesy is appreciated.<br>
    But I am aware that I do not<br>
    effectively convey the fear called<br>
    for in this scene.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, you've never known fear.<br>
    But as an acute observer of<br>
    behavior, you certainly should<br>
    be able to approximate...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Sir... That would not be an<br>
    appropriate basis for an effective<br>
    performance. Not by the standards<br>
    set by my mentors.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Devil's Due&quot; - REV. 11/5/90 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your mentors... ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yessir. I have studied the<br>
    philosophies of virtually every<br>
    known acting master, but I find<br>
    myself particularly attracted to<br>
    Stanislavsky, Adler, Garnav...<br>
    proponents of a performance<br>
    technique known as &quot;The Method.&quot;</p>
  <p> Off Picard's reaction, they EXIT the holodeck...</p>
  <p>4 OMITTED</p>
  <p>5 INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> As they exit, Data still in costume, pushes a few<br>
    holodeck computer buttons to end the program, then<br>
    walks with Picard... a few supernumeraries glance at<br>
    them as they pass...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    &quot;Method acting?&quot; Yes, I'm vaguely<br>
    familiar with it... why would you<br>
    choose such an old-fashioned<br>
    approach...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps because the technique<br>
    requires an actor to seek his own<br>
    emotional awareness to understand<br>
    the character he plays...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But that would seem an impossible<br>
    task for you, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have modified the method for<br>
    my own use, sir. Since I have<br>
    no emotional awareness to create<br>
    a performance, I am attempting<br>
    to use performance to create an<br>
    emotional awareness. I believe<br>
    if I can learn to duplicate the<br>
    fear of Ebenezer Scrooge, then<br>
    I will be one step closer to<br>
    being truly human.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Devil's Due&quot; - REV. 11/2/90 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain Picard, please report to<br>
    the Bridge...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On my way, Number One...<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Data, the moment you decided to<br>
    stop imitating other actors and<br>
    to create your own<br>
    interpretation... you were<br>
    already one step closer to being<br>
    truly human.</p>
  <p> He EXITS, leaving Data to ponder this.</p>
  <p>6 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> WORF, RIKER at their positions. As Picard ENTERS...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've received an emergency<br>
    transmission from the Ventax Two<br>
    science station...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nature of the emergency...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Uncertain... the signal was<br>
    interrupted by...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (interrupting, adjusting<br>
    his controls)<br>
    Contact reestablished with Ventax<br>
    Two, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p> The viewscreen shifts from the starfield to the image<br>
    of a wispy-haired, nervous and extremely harried man,<br>
    DR. HOWARD CLARK. He is standing in a small,<br>
    equipment-filled room; behind him are several<br>
    TECHNICIANS, who are racing about frantically,<br>
    gathering books, ledgers and other effects. The<br>
    picture on the screen is filled periodically with<br>
    bursts of static; every now and then the screen goes<br>
    blank and then flickers back to life.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Devil's Due&quot; - REV. 11/5/90 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Continually in the background we HEAR a distant roar,<br>
    and an incessant pounding noise outside the door.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of<br>
    the U.S.S. Enterprise. Please<br>
    identify yourself.</p>
  <p> DR. CLARK (ON SCREEN)<br>
    I am Doctor Howard Clark, director<br>
    of the science station here on<br>
    Ventax Two. Thank you for<br>
    responding.</p>
  <p> As he speaks, the picture blurs, trembles and fades.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant Worf, can you improve<br>
    our reception?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The trouble is at the transmission<br>
    source, sir.</p>
  <p> The viewscreen image comes back to life uncertainly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor Clark, we can barely<br>
    maintain communication with you.<br>
    Can you boost the level of your<br>
    power source?</p>
  <p> DR. CLARK (ON SCREEN)<br>
    I'm afraid not, Captain. It's<br>
    under attack.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Under attack?</p>
  <p> DR. CLARK (ON SCREEN)<br>
    There is a mob outside, trying<br>
    to break into the station. The<br>
    planet is in chaos. Looting.<br>
    Fires...</p>
  <p> Again, the picture breaks up momentarily.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign, set a new course for<br>
    Ventax Two...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Devil's Due&quot; - REV. 11/5/90 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> The Conn operator acknowledges... When the picture<br>
    returns, the image is even fuzzier than before.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor Clark, what has caused the<br>
    riots... ?</p>
  <p> DR. CLARK (ON SCREEN)<br>
    Mass hysteria... it's impossible<br>
    to explain... these people are<br>
    all convinced their world is<br>
    coming to an end... tomorrow.<br>
    Please, we must have your<br>
    immediate...</p>
  <p> The picture breaks apart and is lost for good. And<br>
    on Picard's reaction, we</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around a bluish planet, Ventax Two.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 44474.5.<br>
    We have reached Ventax Two and<br>
    are attempting to contact the<br>
    Federation science station, which<br>
    at last report was under siege<br>
    by a mob.</p>
  <p>8 INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard is seated in the Command Chair. Riker, Worf<br>
    and Data are at their stations. Supernumerary at Conn.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They are transmitting again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen, before we lose contact.</p>
  <p> The viewscreen flickers to life. Again we see Dr.<br>
    Clark on screen. The situation on the planet has<br>
    obviously deteriorated. The roar of the mob outside<br>
    and the pounding on the door practically drowns out<br>
    all else. Smoke fills the room; the people inside are<br>
    in a panic. The reception is terrible; we can hardly<br>
    make out any details in the blur and snow of the<br>
    picture. Dr. Clark is leaning in towards our<br>
    viewpoint, yelling frantically.</p>
  <p> DR. CLARK (ON SCREEN)<br>
    Enterprise, Enterprise! Do you<br>
    read me? Emergency! We need<br>
    help!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor Clark, this is Captain<br>
    Picard. We are ready to beam you<br>
    and your staff on board the...</p>
  <p> There is a CRASH, a sudden influx of light and a<br>
    deafening roar. The door has collapsed off screen.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Devil's Due&quot; - REV. 11/7/90 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> There is pendemonium, an impressionistic blur of chaos<br>
    and confusion barely decipherable as the snowy picture<br>
    dissolves into visual static. The last words we hear<br>
    over the broken picture --</p>
  <p> DR. CLARK (O.C.)<br>
    (crying out)<br>
    They're in! They're in!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Transporter Room Three! Lock onto<br>
    the station team and beam them<br>
    aboard.</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER OFFICER'S COM VOICE<br>
    I've locked onto Doctor Clark.<br>
    I can't pick out the others. It's<br>
    a mess down there.</p>

  <p>11 OMITTED</p>
  <p>12 INT. CAPT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Dr. Clark, still shaky, is seated as Picard fetches two<br>
    cups of tea...</p>
  <p> DR. CLARK<br>
    The people of Ventax Two live<br>
    in an agrarian society. At least,<br>
    they do now.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Devil's Due&quot; - REV. 11/5/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What do you mean, &quot;now?&quot;</p>
  <p> DR. CLARK<br>
    It's an interesting<br>
    anthropological question. One<br>
    we were studying before the...<br>
    trouble began. In their distant<br>
    past the Ventaxian culture had<br>
    achieved an extremely advanced<br>
    scientific level, but a millennium<br>
    ago they turned their backs on<br>
    technology.</p>
  <p> Picard delivers a cup of tea... the doctor's hand is<br>
    still unsteady...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Be careful, it's hot...</p>
  <p> The doctor takes a sip trying to calm down...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So they reverted to a simpler<br>
    existence... ?</p>
  <p> DR. CLARK<br>
    And have remained that way for<br>
    centuries. First contact was made<br>
    by a Klingon expedition seventy<br>
    years ago. Since then, new<br>
    technology has been available to<br>
    the Ventaxians. They simply have<br>
    no interest in it. There have<br>
    been virtually no social problems<br>
    to be found on this planet... in<br>
    fact, I would have described their<br>
    society as idyllic until...</p>
  <p> A beat as he searches to reasonably explain it...<br>
    almost embarrassed to say so...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Until what, doctor?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Devil's Due&quot; - REV. 11/5/90 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DR. CLARK<br>
    It's hard to believe...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Several years ago, Acost Jared,<br>
    the Ventaxian head of state,<br>
    began to grow increasingly<br>
    obsessed with the legend of<br>
    &quot;Ardra.&quot; With each passing day,<br>
    he grew more anxious, until he<br>
    talked about little else. &quot;Ardra<br>
    is coming back. Ardra will be<br>
    here soon. We must all leave<br>
    before Ardra returns.&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And who is Ardra?</p>
  <p> DR. CLARK<br>
    (shakes his head in<br>
    disbelief)<br>
    For all intents and purposes...<br>
    (beat, sighs)<br>
    ... the devil.<br>
    (off Picard's look)<br>
    Captain, these people actually<br>
    believe they've sold their souls<br>
    to the devil.</p>
  <p> Before Picard can respond...</p>

  <p>13 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard and Clark ENTER. Data, Worf, Riker, TROI<br>
    present. On the viewscreen: JARED, a dignified man,<br>
    dressed in contemporary 24th century clothes, paces<br>
    with a handful of aides in the Atheneum.</p>
  <p> DR. CLARK<br>
    Jared, you must secure the release<br>
    of my people. I can't believe<br>
    you would allow this.</p>
  <p> Jared shakes his head and smiles sadly.</p>

    Ardra's arrival is supposed to<br>
    be heralded by the &quot;shaking of<br>
    the cities&quot;... there have been<br>
    a series of geological tremors<br>
    on the planet... minor quakes...<br>
    nothing extraordinary...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But poorly timed...</p>
  <p> JARED<br>
    There is more. For several nights<br>
    there have been visions of<br>
    Ardra... again, just as the<br>
    contract said would occur before<br>
    her return.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Visions? Do you mean dreams?</p>
  <p> JARED<br>
    No. She has appeared. I myself<br>
    have seen her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jared, tell your people if our<br>
    hostages are released, I am<br>
    prepared to offer you Federation<br>
    assistance should this Ardra<br>
    return.</p>
  <p> JARED<br>
    I am afraid it will not matter.<br>
    They know your weapons are useless<br>
    against her, Captain. I will make<br>
    inquiries concerning the hostages.<br>
    The innocent should not suffer<br>

    This situation is deteriorating,<br>

    levels of anxiety that could lead<br>
    to suicide...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, what do we know about<br>
    this Ardra figure?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    She is a cornerstone of Ventaxian<br>
    theology. It seems that Ardra<br>
    came to Ventax Two and promised<br>
    one thousand years of peace and<br>
    prosperity. As her price, she<br>
    would return and enslave the<br>
    entire population. In the<br>
    Ventaxian culture, it is<br>
    considered bad luck to speak her<br>
    name out loud. The threat &quot;may<br>
    Ardra come to your door&quot; is<br>
    considered a most insulting<br>
    epithet.</p>
  <p> DR. CLARK<br>
    I've often puzzled over this dark<br>
    legend. It simply doesn't fit in<br>
    with the rest of Ventaxian<br>
    mythology... which is sunny and<br>
    joyous.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Perhaps the Ardra myth is a result<br>
    of their contact with the<br>
    Klingons.</p>
  <p> Geordi glances at Worf...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (joking)<br>
    Are you implying Klingons are not<br>
    sunny and joyous?</p>
  <p> Worf grunts.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ardra predates the Klingon<br>
    influence on Ventax Two.</p>

  <p>16 INT. ATHENEUM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Ardra walks gingerly through the fallen debris. She is<br>
    by no means overly-dramatic in an anti-Christ sort of<br>
    way, in fact she underplays the role entirely... she's<br>
    much more the William Morris agent than the classic<br>
    devil. When she approaches one of the Ventaxians, they<br>
    cower and back away in fear.</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    I am disappointed. I expected<br>
    my tenants to take better care<br>
    of my property.</p>
  <p> She stops before Jared... who summons every last bit of<br>
    his courage to confront her.</p>
  <p> JARED<br>
    Ardra, most powerful one, I am<br>
    Jared, Leader of Ventax Two. I<br>
    take responsibility for all that<br>
    displeases you. Please do not<br>
    punish my people.</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>

    The contract does agree to deliver<br>
    the people of Ventax Two into the<br>
    personal servitude of Ardra at<br>
    the end of one thousand years<br>
    of peace. I have compared the<br>

    govern the planet. The language<br>
    of the agreement is correct in<br>
    every detail.</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    Such speed and accuracy. You're<br>
    much too talented to be human...</p>

    Bonus?</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    When the contract came to term,<br>
    I gained clear title to the<br>

    Captain's log, supplemental. The<br>

    your study...</p>

  <p> Picard stands, takes a thoughtful beat...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We can only speculate about what<br>
    occurred on this planet a thousand<br>
    years ago, Data... Maybe a<br>
    Ventaxian leader saw the<br>
    destruction of his society at hand<br>
    and conceived this Contract of<br>
    Ardra to motivate change. Or<br>
    maybe there really was an Ardra<br>
    of some sort who was the basis<br>
    of this myth.<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    Who knows? The point is --<br>
    somehow a fundamental theology was<br>
    created that transformed this<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    A fear that someday Ardra would<br>
    return for remuneration.</p>

    As you may recollect from your<br>
    performance as Ebenezer Scrooge,<br>
    Data, &quot;fear&quot; can be a powerful<br>
    motivator.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Indeed, Captain, in the story,<br>
    the spirits used fear to motivate<br>
    Scrooge to reform his character.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In the hands of a con artist, fear<br>
    can be used to motivate obedience,<br>
    capitulation... to exploit<br>
    innocent people. That is what<br>
    I believe is happening here.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Is there no possibility at all<br>
    she is the same Ardra who was here<br>
    a millenium ago?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I appreciate the fact that we have<br>
    encountered species that live that<br>
    long... so I will admit the<br>
    possibility. But I do not believe<br>
    this woman is the devil or had<br>
    the powers to create harmony on<br>
    this world. These people made<br>
    massive changes that improved<br>
    their quality of life... they did<br>
    this on their own. And I intend<br>
    to prove it. But I need a<br>
    loophole... something I can use<br>
    to challenge the validity of the<br>

    In effect, it was a contract<br>
    dispute over services rendered<br>
    by a Klingon craftsman on the<br>
    construction of a Ventaxian home.<br>
    Because the dispute involved an<br>
    alien culture, the parties decided<br>

    courts would resolve the issue.<br>

    noon and night.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We must agree on an arbiter.</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    Very well. I choose Mister Data.<br>
    Any objections?</p>
  <p> Picard didn't expect this. He fumbles for a response.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data? He is a member of<br>
    my crew.</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    Of my crew. And he's an android.<br>
    He is incapable of deceit or bias.<br>
    He has no feelings to get in the<br>
    way of his judgment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ardra, before he responds, may<br>
    I have a word in private with<br>
    Captain Picard?</p>
  <p> She nods. Data takes Picard aside.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, I request that you reject<br>
    me as arbiter.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why?</p>

  <p>38 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ardra is right. If I am chosen,<br>
    I will perform my duties without<br>
    bias or sentiment. I cannot<br>
    guarantee that I will deliver a<br>
    verdict in your favor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, where else on this planet<br>
    will I find someone that she<br>
    cannot intimidate. You are<br>
    incapable of fear... in this play,<br>
    you are the perfect choice for<br>
    the role.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, I will have to precisely<br>
    follow the rules of conduct for<br>
    a ventaxian jurist.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand. You'll make a fine<br>
    judge.</p>
  <p> Picard moves back to Ardra.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I accept Data as arbiter.</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    Then let the hearing begin.</p>
  <p>39 INT. ATHENEUM</p>
  <p> The hearing is held in the round, distinctly different<br>
    than our own courtroom experience. The questioner (at<br>
    the moment, Ardra) is in the center, moving around at<br>
    will, asking questions of any witness she chooses.<br>
    Data is in a neutral position between Picard and<br>
    Ardra's chair. Also present is Jared. There are no<br>
    spectators. Ardra addresses Jared --</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    Could you describe the state of<br>
    your planet when I first visited<br>
    a thousand years ago?</p>
  <p> Picard rises.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Objection. The witness has no<br>
    personal knowledge.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Overruled. He is qualified to<br>
    present an historical view.<br>
    Answer the question.</p>
  <p> Disgruntled, Picard sits back down.</p>
  <p> JARED<br>
    A thousand years ago our planet<br>
    was dying. Overcrowded and<br>
    dangerous city-states warred<br>
    unceasingly with each other. The<br>
    air and water were polluted with<br>
    industrial waste. There was a<br>
    constant threat of starvation and<br>
    epidemic.</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    And then what happened?</p>
  <p> JARED<br>
    And then you came.</p>
  <p> Picard rises again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Objection. There is no conclusive<br>
    evidence that this woman visited<br>
    the planet a thousand years ago...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Devil's Due&quot; - REV. 11/13/90 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I suppose you want a thousand year<br>
    old witness?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (dry, to Ardra)<br>
    That would be quite acceptable.</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    Jared. In the contract, does it<br>
    specify how you would know me when<br>
    I return?</p>
  <p> JARED<br>
    Yes... by the date...</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    Anything else... ?</p>
  <p> JARED<br>
    ... by the shaking of the cities...<br>
    and by the visions...</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    And all of these occurred on<br>
    schedule.</p>
  <p> JARED<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    Your honor, I submit I have<br>
    established my identity as stated<br>
    by the contract.</p>

    Captain Picard, my interpretation<br>
    of Ventaxian law suggests under<br>
    these circumstances, this is<br>
    acceptable... your objection is<br>
    overruled.</p>

  <p> Picard blinks, sits down.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Ardra)<br>
    You may proceed.</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    Thank-you, your honor.<br>
    (to Jared)<br>
    When I first set foot on Ventax<br>
    Two, what did I offer your people?</p>
  <p> JARED<br>
    According to the scrolls, you<br>
    offered to give us a thousand<br>
    years of peace and prosperity,<br>
    if we would promise to surrender<br>
    ourselves to you at the end of<br>
    the term.</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    Now why do you think they would<br>
    strike such a bargain...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I must object! The answer would<br>
    be pure speculation.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The question is phrased correctly.<br>
    Please answer.</p>

  <p>39 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> JARED<br>
    We had nothing to lose. There<br>
    was no hope in sight.</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    Until I came along.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Objection!</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    I withdraw the observation. No<br>
    further questions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your honor, nothing in this<br>
    testimony proves that Ardra<br>
    herself had any power to affect<br>
    the lives of the Ventaxians.<br>
    My opponent has failed to prove<br>
    her case and I therefore move<br>
    that her claim be summarily<br>
    dismissed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I find no cause to invalidate the<br>
    contract at this time. The<br>
    arbitration will continue.</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    Your honor, Captain Picard as a<br>
    new visitor to my planet has been<br>
    a consistent doubter of my<br>
    abilities... I'd like to ask him<br>
    a few questions if I may...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is highly irregular to question<br>
    the opposing advocate but I see<br>
    no reason to deny it. Proceed...</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    Please don't take any offense at<br>
    these questions, you know how fond<br>
    I am of you...</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jared, you have described quite<br>
    thoroughly the history of your<br>
    people before and after Ardra's<br>
    first visit. But I am a little<br>
    unclear on the change itself.<br>
    Did Ardra simply snap her fingers,<br>
    transforming Ventax Two into<br>
    paradise?</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    Objection. Picard is mocking me.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Overruled. The opposing<br>
    advocate's job is to mock your<br>
    argument.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles as Data turns back to Jared.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Please answer the question.</p>
  <p> JARED<br>
    The changes occurred gradually,<br>
    over a long period of time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Did she personally form the<br>
    government that has peacefully<br>
    ruled Ventax Two for a millennium?</p>
  <p> JARED<br>
    No, historical records indicate<br>
    a council was convened to assess<br>
    our options. They drew up a new<br>
    constitution which the population<br>
    later ratified.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see. So Ardra advised this<br>
    council...</p>
  <p> JARED<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, then she must have destroyed<br>

  <p> JARED<br>
    We shifted our economy from an<br>

  <p> back to normal...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your honor, I appreciate the<br>
    court's indulgence... allow me<br>
    to explain. A team from the<br>
    Enterprise has taken control of<br>
    this woman's ship in orbit around<br>
    Ventax Two. Thank you for your<br>
    help, Number One.</p>

  <p>53 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Glad to be of service, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They have been monitoring me on<br>
    my communicator... and executing<br>
    a prearranged program on her<br>
    ship's computer... a fairly<br>
    ingenious combination of force<br>
    field projection, holography, and<br>
    transporter effects. Ardra<br>
    controls her magic literally by<br>
    the blink of an eye... centuries<br>
    old technology -- an implant that<br>
    allows her eye movements to choose<br>
    and activate each illusion.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    She once told us she is known by<br>
    many names. At least she was<br>
    honest about that. Her crew has<br>
    admitted that she has in fact<br>
    used twenty-three aliases in this<br>
    sector alone...</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    (overlapping)<br>
    You had no right...</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... deceiving innocent people in<br>
    petty schemes for years.</p>
  <p> He turns to Jared.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ventax Two offered her the<br>
    greatest opportunity of her<br>
    nefarious career. She learned<br>
    about the myth of Ardra, studied<br>
    it... and expertly played on your<br>
    fears until your people were ready<br>
    to virtually surrender to her.</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    (standing)<br>
    Your Honor, under the<br>
    circumstances, I believe it is<br>
    only fair that I release the<br>
    Ventaxians from their<br>
    obligation... and I'll even let<br>
    them keep the peace they have...<br>
    and I'll just be on my way...</p>
  <p> But Jared touches a panel, signaling TWO SENTRIES to<br>
    ENTER. As Ardra starts to leave, the sentries block<br>
    her way.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    With the advocate's withdrawal,<br>
    the contract is hereby dissolved.</p>
  <p> He slams down the gavel.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This arbitration is adjourned.</p>
  <p> All rise.</p>
  <p> JARED<br>
    Thank you, Captain... you saved<br>
    our lives...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, Jared... as I've tried to tell<br>
    you, you saved your own lives a<br>
    long time ago...</p>
  <p> Data approaches... the 'old' Data...</p>

    Congratulations, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Your honor.</p>
  <p> But as they turn to leave, they find themselves facing<br>
    Ardra... She raises an eyebrow....</p>
  <p> ARDRA<br>
    You would have had more fun if<br>
    you lost.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Until we meet again, Jean-Luc<br>
    Picard of the Starship<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> With that, the sentries take her away... as Data and<br>
    Picard exchange looks and begin to exit...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
