  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship moving at impulse power.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log: Stardate 44246.3<br>
    We are investigating radiation<br>
    anomalies reported in the Gamma<br>
    Arigulon system by the starship<br>
    LaSalle. Preliminary readings<br>
    are inconclusive.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WESLEY, and WORF at their<br>
    stations.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No change, Commander. I can<br>
    detect no abnormalities in the<br>
    star's radiant energy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Prepare two class one probes.</p>
  <p> Data presses a few panels.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Probes ready, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Initiate launch sequence.</p>
  <p> Data begins to work his console.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Reunion&quot; - REV. 9/5/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (reads console)<br>
    Captain... Klingon attack cruiser<br>
    decloaking, bearing zero-one-zero<br>
    mark three-two-seven.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Belay that order, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Did Starfleet mention any Klingon<br>
    ships in this sector?</p>
  <p> Picard shakes his head.</p>

  <p>5 ON VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The attack cruiser (bigger than a bird-of-prey)<br>
    DECLOAKS.</p>
  <p>6 RETURN TO SCENE</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are being hailed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All stop, Mister Crusher.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Aye, sir. All stop.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Open channel.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Reunion&quot; - REV. 9/5/90 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>7 ON VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR, the striking half-human, half-Klingon woman<br>
    appears on the screen. She wears an attractive tunic<br>
    and is standing in front of a Klingon bulkhead. She<br>
    is here on important business and it shows on her<br>
    face.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Hello, Captain Picard.</p>
  <p>8 ON WORF</p>
  <p> He is pleasantly surprised at the sight of K'Ehleyr...<br>
    but then he seems to remember something disturbing, and<br>
    he pulls himself back into his customary Klingon stoic<br>
    pose.</p>
  <p>9 NEW ANGLE - INTERCUT AS NEEDED (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Ambassador K'Ehleyr... This is<br>
    an unexpected pleasure.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    It's good to see you again,<br>
    Captain.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Lieutenant Worf.</p>
  <p> It is said with a pleasant affection and a past<br>
    relationship is obvious. Worf is uncomfortable, but<br>
    manages a slight nod of acknowledgement.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How may we be of assistance,<br>
    Ambassador?</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    There is an urgent matter we must<br>
    discuss, Captain. Permission to<br>
    come aboard?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Granted.</p>
  <p> The viewer returns to a shot of the cruiser. Picard<br>
    turns to Worf.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Reunion&quot; - REV. 9/5/90 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant, please receive our<br>
    guest.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain... I must request<br>
    permission to... send another<br>
    officer.</p>
  <p> Picard is a little surprised.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    May I ask your reason?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    My... dishonor among Klingons...<br>
    may offend Ambassador K'Ehleyr.</p>
  <p> Picard frowns...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (firm)<br>
    You are a member of this crew,<br>
    Lieutenant... and I will not have<br>
    you go into hiding whenever a<br>
    Klingon ship uncloaks.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I withdraw the request, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard nods and Worf EXITS.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>10 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN behind the console. Worf<br>
    ENTERS.</p>
  <p> TECHNICIAN<br>
    I just received coordinates, sir.<br>
    Ready to transport two from the<br>
    Klingon vessel.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Two?</p>
  <p> TECHNICIAN<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf isn't sure what to make of that.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Reunion&quot; - 9/4/90 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p> Worf tries to prepare himself. He is inwardly excited<br>
    at the prospect of seeing this woman from his past, but<br>
    holds himself tightly in check. The tech works the<br>
    console.</p>
  <p>11 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> K'Ehleyr and a Klingon boy (ALEXANDER) MATERIALIZE.<br>
    (The boy should look about five human years old).<br>
    K'Ehleyr smiles, glancing from the boy to Worf. On<br>
    Worf's stunned reaction...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Reunion&quot; - REV. 9/7/90 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:<br>

    thru OMITTED<br>
    13</p>
  <p>13A INT. DAY CARE CENTER</p>
  <p> (As seen in &quot;The Offspring&quot;) Worf is standing in the<br>
    outer office watching K'Ehleyr and Alexander through<br>
    the glass. K'Ehleyr is saying goodbye to Alexander<br>
    in the classroom area. There are SEVERAL CHILDREN<br>
    playing in the b.g. K'Ehleyr ENTERS the outer office.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (a little concerned)<br>
    I hope he'll be all right.<br>
    Alexander hasn't had much contact<br>
    with other children.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at her for a beat... glances back at<br>
    Alexander... decides not to respond and moves toward<br>
    the Corridor door. K'Ehleyr follows.</p>
  <p>14 OMITTED</p>
  <p>14A INT. TURBOLIFT - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> As they ENTER.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Bridge.</p>
  <p> The turbolift MOVES. Worf is staring straight ahead,<br>
    avoiding K'Ehleyr's gaze. She studies him, waiting for<br>
    some kind of response. After a long beat, she grins<br>
    sardonically.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Not even a bite on the cheek for<br>
    old time's sake?</p>
  <p> Worf doesn't see the humor in this, as usual.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Perhaps you are not aware of my<br>
    dishonor. I have accepted...<br>
    discommendation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Reunion&quot; - REV. 9/7/90 - ACT ONE 6A.</p>
  <p>14A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    I've heard. So now what? I have<br>
    to perform some ridiculous ritual<br>
    to talk to you?</p>
  <p> Worf turns on her, rage boils to the surface. This<br>
    is not a matter he takes lightly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You may not respect our<br>
    traditions... I do!</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (unabashed)<br>
    Sorry. I just thought you might<br>
    want to talk.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    A few minutes ago, you looked like<br>
    someone with a question to ask.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Must I ask the question?</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Yes. You must.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at her... almost says something... then the<br>
    mask closes over his face once more. The doors OPEN.<br>
    Worf takes a step to leave, but K'Ehleyr stops him and<br>
    tries once more to reach him.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What should I tell Alexander...<br>
    that he has no father?</p>
  <p> Now it's been said aloud. A beat before Worf forces<br>
    himself to EXIT. K'Ehleyr is disappointed... but she<br>
    follows him.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>14B INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (FORMERLY SCENE 12)</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Data, TROI, and Worf listening to<br>
    K'Ehleyr.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Reunion&quot; - REV. 9/7/90 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>14B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    The Klingon Empire is at a<br>
    critical juncture. We may be<br>
    facing civil war.</p>
  <p> Reactions around the table.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    War over what?</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    The usual excuses... tradition...<br>
    duty...<br>
    (with glance at Worf)<br>
    honor...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The word &quot;excuses&quot; implies that<br>
    there are ulterior motives for<br>
    a conflict.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    I won't bore you with the<br>
    intricacies of Klingon politics.<br>
    Basically, two factions are<br>
    trying to seize power.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you believe there is a threat<br>
    to the Federation in this...<br>
    struggle?</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Klingon wars seldom remain<br>
    confined to the Empire. Sooner<br>
    or later they'll drag in the<br>
    neighboring star systems, then<br>
    the Tholians, the Ferengi... the<br>
    Federation won't be able to stay<br>
    out of it for long.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    This has been coming for some<br>
    time. Only K'mpec, the head of<br>
    the council, has been able to<br>
    maintain the peace.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Now something has changed that.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Reunion&quot; - REV. 9/7/90 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>14B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Correct.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    K'mpec is dying.</p>
  <p> Picard's frown deepens. He leans forward.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    He is aboard the cruiser. He has<br>
    come specifically to meet with<br>
    you, Captain. Alone.</p>
  <p> On Picard's reaction...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>

  <p>15 OMITTED</p>
  <p>16 EXT. SPACE - KLINGON CRUISER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship hangs in space.</p>
  <p>17 INT. K'MPEC'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> A large cabin intended to house visiting admirals or<br>
    dignitaries. There are a few nasty-looking weapons in<br>
    plain view along with decorative banners and emblems of<br>
    the Empire, denoting its current occupant's rank as head<br>
    of the High Council. There are several chairs and<br>
    tables. A flagon of wine sits on one table. A single<br>
    set of doors is visible. The doors OPEN and Picard<br>
    is escorted in by a Klingon sentry.</p>
  <p>18 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> K'MPEC moves out of a dark corner and steps into the<br>
    light. He looks older, more frail than when we saw him<br>
    before. His cloak hangs on him like the shawl of an<br>
    old man rather than the cape of a warrior, but there is<br>
    still a vestige of steel left in his eyes.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    It's about time you arrived,<br>
    Picard. Didn't she tell you I<br>
    was dying?</p>
  <p> He waves out the sentry. K'mpec is easily winded and<br>
    he sits.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I heard you were ill.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    (matter-of-fact)<br>
    I'm not ill, I'm dying. Sit.</p>
  <p> Picard sits. K'mpec's bravado disappears.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I need your help.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If the Enterprise medical<br>
    facility...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Reunion&quot; - REV. 9/7/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    Too late. For months I've been<br>
    poisoned with small doses of<br>
    Veridium Six.<br>
    (indicating wine)<br>
    The wine. There is no cure.</p>
  <p> K'mpec picks up the flagon and drinks a large gulp<br>
    of wine in a contemptuous gesture. He takes a ragged<br>
    breath... winded again. The poison is catching up<br>
    with him. Picard absorbs this... knows that K'mpec<br>
    doesn't want his sympathy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What do you want of me?</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    After I die... you will act in<br>
    my name to arbitrate the struggle<br>
    for power.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts. A beat. Picard, incredulously, studies<br>
    the old leader...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will?</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    No one on the Council can be<br>
    trusted and... I have my reasons<br>
    for wanting an... outsider.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    K'mpec. You can't be serious.<br>
    A Federation officer has no<br>
    business...</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Nonsense. You are an accomplished<br>
    mediator. This is no different<br>
    than any other dispute requiring<br>
    your services.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On the contrary, I think it is<br>
    very different. And I must<br>
    respectfully decline.</p>
  <p> K'mpec rises and regains a bit of the fire we've seen<br>
    before...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Reunion&quot; - REV. 9/7/90 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    If you refuse the dying request<br>
    of the Klingon Supreme<br>
    Commander... it will be a<br>
    Federation insult to all Klingons!</p>
  <p> Picard stares at him. Off-handed --</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    Besides, I've already sent the<br>
    orders to the leaders of the two<br>
    opposing factions. They're on<br>
    their way.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (angry)<br>
    You had no right to involve me<br>
    without my permission.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    If I'd asked, you would have said<br>
    no.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is not a case of simple<br>
    mediation... you are asking me<br>
    to choose the next leader of the<br>
    Klingon Empire.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    No. By tradition, the two<br>
    strongest challengers fight for<br>
    the right of succession. But as<br>
    mediator only you can designate<br>
    those challengers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But you've just said there are<br>
    only two challengers arriving.<br>
    What is the point?</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    The point, my good Captain Picard,<br>
    is for you to discover which one<br>
    of them has killed me -- Gowron<br>
    or Duras.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts to Duras' name.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    Yes -- Duras. I thought you'd<br>
    find that interesting.</p>

  <p>18 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (dry)<br>
    Interesting? Yes, I would say<br>
    that, since he conspired to strip<br>
    Worf of his good name and tried<br>
    to have me killed...</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    And I approved.</p>
  <p> And shrugs, so what? Picard studies him.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    All for the good of the Empire.<br>
    That should be my epitaph.</p>
  <p> This takes a great deal out of him. K'mpec leans back<br>
    in his chair, exhausted.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    Find the assassin. The Klingon<br>
    who kills without showing his face<br>
    has no honor. He must not lead<br>
    the Empire. Such a man would<br>
    be capable of anything. Even war<br>
    with the Federation.</p>
  <p> Picard is a little moved by the sight of this lion in<br>
    winter. He takes a long beat to think it over...<br>
    makes the decision.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. I accept.</p>
  <p> There is a trace of relief in K'mpec's face... his<br>
    final task completed.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    If there is war... it will not<br>
    end quickly. Millions of<br>
    warriors... hundreds of worlds...<br>
    destruction on a galactic scale...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Part of me regrets that I'll miss<br>
    it.</p>

    Alexander is being taught how to play a game using<br>
    large blocks and balls by three other kids. As he<br>
    tries his hand at the game... but instead of following<br>
    the rules, he just grabs all the blocks to the protest<br>
    of the other kids. They try to stop him... Alexander<br>

  <p> Worf and Alexander are heading for K'Ehleyr's quarters.<br>
    Alexander is very curious... trying to probe. Worf is<br>
    resistant, doesn't want to establish a connection with<br>
    the boy, but it's difficult to distance himself.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Where are the other Klingons?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There are no others on board.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The Federation and the Klingon<br>
    Empire were enemies for many<br>
    years. No other Klingons have<br>
    asked to serve in Starfleet.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> Worf is really getting tired of this.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (firm)<br>
    A warrior does not ask so many<br>
    questions.</p>

  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (to Alexander)<br>
    Hello! You're back early.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    He made me leave.</p>
  <p> K'Ehleyr gives Worf a questioning look.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Why don't you go to your room and<br>
    play.</p>
  <p> Alexander EXITS to adjacent bedroom.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (sarcastic)<br>
    Is he under arrest?</p>
  <p> Worf doesn't want to play her game of verbal give-and-<br>
    take.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (angry)<br>
    He knows nothing of our ways!</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Our ways? You mean Klingon ways,<br>
    don't you?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He is Klingon!</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    He is also my son... and I am half-<br>
    human. He will find his own ways.<br>

  <p> K'EHLEYR (Cont'd)<br>
    Why the sudden concern? You won't<br>
    even acknowledge that he's yours.</p>
  <p> He knows she's right... it deflates some of his anger,<br>
    but not all of it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Reunion&quot; - REV. 9/5/90 - ACT TWO 16.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Why did you not tell me?</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    And what would you have done?</p>
  <p> Worf looks away, knows where she's going with this.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That's right... you would have<br>
    insisted that we take the oath...<br>
    just as tradition would demand.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You should not have kept this from<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (softer)<br>
    Well, now you know.</p>
  <p> A beat of silence. K'Ehleyr moves to Worf... there<br>
    is still a great deal of attraction and passion between<br>
    them. Worf responds to her gentler tone, but this is<br>
    very difficult for him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I cannot... acknowledge my<br>
    relationship to the boy.</p>
  <p> K'Ehleyr turns away, bitterly disappointed.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It would only harm him.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Because you were dishonored?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    As my son, he would also bear my<br>
    disgrace... as would his<br>
    children.</p>
  <p> K'Ehleyr is frustrated... she wants to understand, but<br>
    Worf is still holding out on her.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Why did you accept discommendation<br>
    from the High Council?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Reunion&quot; - REV. 9/7/90 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Worf looks away, as if watching the scene from the past<br>
    being replayed all over again.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    My father was accused of<br>
    collaborating with the Romulans<br>
    at Khitomer...</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    I know. And I also know that<br>
    you challenged it...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes... at first. Ultimately...<br>
    I withdrew my challenge.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    But why, Worf? I can't believe<br>
    you'd just give up.</p>
  <p> He forces himself to crush down the feelings of rage<br>
    and betrayal that rise to the surface. K'Ehleyr knows<br>
    that Worf still isn't telling her everything.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What really happened?</p>
  <p> Worf wants to answer... debates with himself for a<br>
    second... but knows that he can't. He heads for the<br>
    door... furious at the situation.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    In good time, Duras.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ambassador K'ehleyr will be<br>
    preparing me for my role in the<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Permission to speak freely, sir?</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Duras must not be allowed to lead<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    He has a legal claim, Worf. Your<br>
    personal feelings toward him...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is not personal, sir. His<br>
    father betrayed my people to the<br>
    Romulans. Duras is a traitor.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Klingon tradition may blame the<br>
    son for the father's sins. I<br>
    cannot, Worf. Treason was his<br>
    father's disgrace. Duras' crime<br>
    was to put that blame on your<br>
    father... I will not forget that.<br>
    But you should not forget that<br>
    you chose to accept the<br>
    consequences of that lie.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

  <p> K'mpec's body has been left sitting in his chair.<br>
    There should be no feeling of this being a &quot;wake&quot; in<br>
    the human sense of the word... K'mpec's corpse is<br>
    accorded no reverence. Picard and K'Ehleyr stand at<br>
    the head of the room. K'Ehleyr is holding a<br>

  <p>32 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as the doors OPEN. GOWRON and TWO KLINGON RETAINERS<br>
    ENTER. One of the retainers carries a painstik.<br>
    Gowron looks hostile, impatient... not a likely ally<br>
    for Picard. They barely glance at the corpse and move<br>
    to the left of K'mpec's still form.</p>

    It will be just long enough to<br>

    Gowron snarl with hate at the sight of each other.<br>
    Their retainers tense and it looks like they might<br>

    moves to the opposite side of the room from Gowron.</p>
  <p> Both parties look expectantly at Picard. K'Ehleyr<br>

    stands before K'mpec's corpse.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Qab... jIH... nagil (Face me if<br>

  <p> Gowron plunges the 'stik into K'mpec and relishes the<br>

  <p> They unconsciously move closer... pulled by feelings<br>
    they can barely control. Worf breathes deeply of her<br>
    scent... her eyes blaze with passion... Worf softly<br>
    quotes the ancient Klingon words of devotion.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    jIH dok (My blood)</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (hearing the call)<br>
    maj dok (Our blood)</p>
  <p> They are inches away from each other... the attraction<br>
    is almost overpowering. But Worf finally pulls away<br>
    and breaks the moment.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I cannot allow you to... suffer<br>
    my humiliation.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    There would be no suffering...<br>
    I don't care what other Klingons<br>
    think of you.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But what of the boy? He may want<br>
    to live in the Empire someday.<br>
    He would be an outcast... another<br>
    traitor from a family of traitors.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    &quot;Family of traitors?&quot; I don't<br>
    believe that for a minute.</p>
  <p> But now Worf reaches out to her... makes a personal<br>
    appeal and connection.</p>

  <p>35 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

    Respect my wishes in this matter.<br>
    I cannot take the oath with you...<br>
    (very difficult)<br>
    And I cannot claim your son.</p>

  <p> K'Ehleyr looks in his eyes... sees the pain there and<br>
    reluctantly acquiesces. A long beat.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    If you cannot be his father...<br>
    at least be his friend.</p>
  <p> Worf considers this... and nods his agreement. They<br>
    continue to look at each other with barely restrained<br>

    We need more time.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Duras and Gowron will be here in<br>

    can delay this meeting again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there some way of stretching<br>
    out the formalities once they<br>
    arrive?</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    In the modern Rite of Succession,<br>
    only a brief proclamation that<br>
    two challengers have been chosen<br>
    is necessary.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You said &quot;modern Rite&quot;... how was<br>
    the ritual performed in the past?</p>
  <p> K'Ehleyr thinks for a moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Reunion&quot; - REV. 9/7/90 - ACT THREE 26A.</p>
  <p>36A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    The old forms dictated that the<br>
    challengers perform the ja'chuq.<br>
    (beat as she recalls)<br>
    It's a long, involved ceremony<br>
    where the challengers list the<br>
    battles they've won, the prizes<br>
    they've taken... the idea is to<br>
    prove their worthiness to lead<br>
    the Council.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can the old form still be used?</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (a small smile)<br>
    It's up to you... you can use<br>
    any form you want.</p>
  <p> Picard sees a plan and smiles to himself in<br>
    satisfaction.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Captain... What do you know about<br>
    Worf's discommendation?</p>
  <p> Picard's expression goes neutral.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    My interest is... personal. I<br>
    understand that you were there...<br>
    you stood by him before the<br>
    Council. I'd like to know what<br>
    happened.</p>
  <p> Picard looks away... thinks for a beat... knows there<br>
    can be only one answer. He turns back to K'Ehleyr.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry... but I cannot discuss<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> K'Ehleyr is disappointed... she waits a beat and then<br>

  <p>37 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Duras and Gowron are moving restlessly in the room...<br>
    like caged animals. TWO N.D. SECURITY GUARDS are<br>
    posted in the center and they watch the two men<br>
    closely. Picard and K'Ehleyr ENTER.</p>
  <p> Picard moves to the head of the table, K'Ehleyr stands<br>
    at his side.</p>
  <p> DURAS<br>
    The Council must have a leader...<br>
    now!<br>

    Complete the rite so I can kill<br>

  <p> Gowron turns on Duras... the Security Guards move<br>
    closer, ready to separate them if necessary.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (deadly)<br>
    You will die slowly, Duras.</p>
  <p> DURAS<br>
    You've already proved you don't<br>
    have the courage to face me...<br>
    perhaps you should plant another<br>
    bomb...</p>
  <p> Gowron explodes. He HITS one security guard, knocking<br>
    him out of the way. Duras prepares himself for attack<br>
    as Gowron moves on him. The other security guard pulls<br>
    his phaser and points it at Gowron.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    mev yap! (Stop!)</p>
  <p> Duras and Gowron stop automatically... the first<br>
    security guard gets up and pulls his phaser. A tense<br>
    beat.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    Sit down.</p>
  <p> The two Klingons make no move to obey, but neither do<br>
    they move toward each other.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We will begin the ja'chuq.</p>
  <p> That got their attention... they both react and turn to<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    What!</p>
  <p> DURAS<br>
    (re: K'Ehleyr)<br>
    This woman is giving you bad<br>
    advice, Picard. The ja'chuq is<br>
    obsolete.</p>
  <p> Picard is unfazed by this. He gestures to the two<br>
    Security guards, and they put away their phasers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I choose to respect the ancient<br>
    ritual. Each of you must prove<br>
    your worthiness to lead the High<br>
    Council.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    That will take hours!</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>

  <p> Worf is trying to interest Alexander in some of the<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Kathless... the Unforgettable...<br>
    he united the Homeworld in the<br>
    year...</p>
  <p> Alexander walks over to another part of the room...<br>
    looking for something more interesting. Worf puts down<br>
    the statue and tries again. Alexander is examining a<br>
    tricorder.</p>

  <p> Alexander's interest is momentary, however, and he goes<br>
    into the bedroom. Worf follows.</p>
  <p>39 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> revealing more of Worf's bedroom. Alexander is looking<br>
    with keen interest at something on a bulkhead. MOVE TO<br>
    REVEAL a mounted case with a weapon inside. It is<br>
    semi-circular curved blade that branches to four<br>
    points. It is about three feet wide. There is a<br>
    terrible beauty about the blade. Worf sees that he can<br>
    make a connection here.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is a bat'telh.</p>
  <p> Alexander continues to stare at the weapon. Worf<br>
    carefully removes it from the case. The bat'telh is<br>
    held by two handles on the mid-exterior of the blade.<br>
    There is a sense of reverence and respect in his<br>
    attitude toward the sword.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It belonged to my father... it<br>
    has been in our family for ten<br>
    generations.</p>
  <p> Alexander is fascinated... he has an instinctual<br>
    attraction to the weapon.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Let me hold it.</p>
  <p> He hands it to Alexander. It's heavier than he<br>
    expected. Alexander swings it in an awkward fashion.<br>
    Worf steps in... acting like a patient teacher.</p>

    Do not think of it as a weapon...<br>
    make it part of your hand... your<br>
    arm... make it part of you.</p>
  <p> Worf moves in an intricate dance of parry and thrust<br>
    that combines both power and grace. The bat'telh can<br>
    be used as either shield or sword. Worf hands it back<br>
    to Alexander... the boy tries to emulate the movements.<br>
    Worf starts to physically guide him through the<br>

  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    He has sufficient reason to<br>

  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>

    could quicken the pace.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Possibly. Why should I?</p>
  <p> He casually moves to the windows.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Your position is... unique. Have<br>
    you never wondered about serving<br>
    the Klingon Empire?</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    I serve in my own way.</p>

  <p> GOWRON<br>
    What do you want? Command of a<br>
    ship... a seat on the Council?<br>
    There are many opportunities for<br>
    you in the Empire.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Opportunities that will present<br>
    themselves only if you come to<br>
    power. You talk like a Ferengi.</p>
  <p> Gowron's expression hardens.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    K'mpec was also stubborn... he<br>
    too refused to listen... now he's<br>
    gone... you need not make the same<br>
    mistake.</p>
  <p> K'Ehleyr hears the threat in his voice, and isn't<br>

    Mister Worf, we now have a<br>

    (without hesitation)<br>
    Then that is how it shall be.</p>
  <p> They break the clinch... (NOTE: the following two<br>
    scenes take place very quickly)</p>
  <p>64 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Riker, Data, and the Security Guards ENTER. They<br>
    stop at the sight of Worf and Duras.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf!</p>
  <p>65 ON WORF AND DURAS</p>
  <p> Worf and Duras pay no attention to Riker's arrival.<br>
    (NOTE: and it should not in any way appear that Riker's<br>
    appearance acts as a diversion that affects the outcome<br>
    of the fight.) Worf kicks Duras' legs out from under<br>
    him.</p>
  <p>65A DURAS' FACE</p>
  <p> reacts at the bat'telh is driven deep into his chest...<br>
    he gasps, shudders, then is gone.</p>
  <p>66 WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> Worf stands over his fallen adversary... the bat'telh<br>
    sticking out of Duras's chest.</p>
  <p>66A RIKER AND DATA<br>
    react.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Reunion&quot; - REV. 9/10/90 - ACT FIVE 49A.</p>
  <p>66B WORF</p>
  <p> Eyes still filled with rage, stares at Duras.</p>
  <p>67 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship hangs in space.</p>
  <p>68 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Worf standing before Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant, you are a fine<br>
    officer... your service aboard<br>
    this ship has been exemplary...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Until now.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, I acted within the boundaries<br>
    of Klingon law and tradition.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The High Council seems to agree<br>
    with you. They consider the<br>
    matter to be closed.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I do not.</p>
  <p> Worf stands a little more stiffly... at attention.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Enterprise crew currently<br>
    includes representatives from<br>
    thirteen planets, Mister Worf.<br>
    They each have their individual<br>
    beliefs and values and I respect<br>
    them all. But every member of<br>
    the crew has chosen to serve<br>
    Starfleet. If anyone cannot<br>
    perform his duties because of the<br>
    demands of his society, he must<br>
    resign.</p>
  <p> Picard lets that hang there for a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you wish to resign, Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Reunion&quot; - REV. 9/10/90 - ACT FIVE 49B.</p>
  <p>68 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (swallows hard)<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I would hope you would not throw<br>
    away a promising career.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Reunion&quot; - REV. 9/7/90 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>68 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (softer)<br>
    I understand your pain... we all<br>
    felt very close to K'Ehleyr.<br>
    (long beat)<br>
    A reprimand will be on your<br>
    record. Dismissed.</p>
  <p> Worf turns to leave. Picard thinks for a beat then...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Worf...</p>
  <p> Worf stops. Picard's attitude is more intimate... more<br>
    personal.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Isn't it time for the truth about<br>
    your father's innocence to be<br>
    told? After all, the reasons you<br>
    accepted this dishonor were to<br>
    protect the name of Duras, and<br>
    hold the Empire together. Now<br>
    that he's died in disgrace...<br>
    where is the honor in further<br>
    silence?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Each member of the Klingon high<br>
    council shared in that lie. They<br>
    will not be so willing to admit<br>
    their own dishonor.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But the day will come when my<br>
    brother and I will... &quot;convince&quot;<br>
    them to speak the truth.</p>
  <p> Worf EXITS. On Picard's reaction...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>69 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Worf is speaking to Alexander on the couch.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Reunion&quot; - 9/4/90 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>69 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    My parents... my human parents<br>
    will meet us at Starbase<br>
    Seventy-Three. They will care<br>
    for you.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Why can't I stay with you?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You deserve a home... a family.<br>
    My parents can provide that...<br>
    I cannot.</p>
  <p> Alexander accepts this reluctantly... he looks away.<br>
    Worf knows what's running through this boy's mind.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (gently)<br>
    I miss her too.</p>
  <p> Alexander looks directly into Worf's eyes. A long<br>
    probing stare from the boy before he asks...</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Are you my father?</p>
  <p> Worf struggles for a second... makes the decision.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes... I am your father.</p>
  <p> The human part of Alexander needs something more from<br>
    his father. Alexander hesitates... reaches out... puts<br>
    his arms around Worf. After a beat, Worf returns the<br>
    embrace.</p>
  <p>70 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship moving off into space.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
