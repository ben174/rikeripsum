    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> moving through space. The binary star system is<br>
    visible.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 44631.2.<br>
    We are proceeding through the<br>
    uncharted rim of a binary star<br>
    system, where we may have located<br>
    the U.S.S. Brattain. The missing<br>
    science vessel failed to arrive<br>
    at its destination and has not<br>
    been heard from since a distress<br>
    call twenty-nine days ago.</p>
  <p>2 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF, TROI at their stations;<br>
    ENSIGN RAGER at Conn. On the viewscreen at a<br>
    distance, a space craft floats adrift.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Magnify.</p>
  <p> The craft springs into the foreground.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's the Brattain, all right.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 1/11/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The ship is intact, sir, with no<br>
    indications of structural damage.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Engines?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    All propulsion systems are shut<br>
    down. The ship is drifting.</p>

    Inconclusive, sir.</p>
  <p> Troi is uneasy, leans forward, as though to catch some<br>
    feeling...</p>

    Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There is life on board... but...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't know... something...</p>
  <p> She shakes her head slightly, as though to rid it of<br>
    something getting in the way.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One, assemble your team.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (keys insignia)<br>
    Doctor Crusher, report to<br>
    Transporter Room Three.<br>
    (to them)<br>

  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Commander... I need to go, also...</p>
  <p> Riker looks at her... need to go? Then he nods at her,<br>
    and he, Data, and Worf head for the turbolift. Troi<br>
    stares out at the drifting space craft for a second,<br>
    troubled, as though hearing some unuttered thought.<br>
    Then she turns and follows the others toward the<br>
    turbolift.</p>
  <p>3 PICARD</p>
  <p> notes her strange demeanor.</p>
  <p>4 INT. BRATTAIN - BRIDGE - MINUTES LATER (OPTICAL))</p>
  <p> The small Bridge is, on first sight, empty. BEVERLY,<br>
    Riker, Worf, Data, and Troi MATERIALIZE at the rear<br>
    of the Bridge. They look around the quiet room,<br>
    getting their bearings. Data heads for a computer<br>
    station, keys information.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is no indication of<br>
    malfunction in any of the main<br>
    systems.</p>
  <p> Riker moves toward the Command Chairs. The Captain's<br>
    seat has a high back which, as he turns it, reveals<br>
    --</p>
  <p>5 CAPTAIN ZAHEVA</p>
  <p> The woman is dead, eyes frozen open in a horrified<br>
    stare. Camera PANS down to reveal a long tool<br>
    plunged straight into her heart.</p>
  <p>6 ON THE GROUP</p>
  <p> as Riker, Troi, and Data react to this grim discovery.</p>
  <p> WORF (V.O.)<br>
    Here's another one.</p>
  <p> They turn to see that --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 12/20/90 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>7 WORF</p>
  <p> has found a second body, underneath a computer console,<br>
    huddled tight to the wall as if in terror. Worf tugs<br>
    the corpse out and it tumbles onto the deck, face and<br>
    chest charred black.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    This was done by a phaser... at<br>
    a setting of six or seven...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There are more over here...</p>
  <p> Now the team realizes that the seemingly empty Bridge<br>
    is a tomb, with bodies having taken refuge under<br>
    consoles, seats, etc.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The entire Bridge crew...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Whoever did this... may still be<br>
    on board.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There's someone alive... but he<br>
    didn't kill these people...</p>
  <p> She moves toward the turbolift, as though drawn by an<br>
    unseen thread.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Here...</p>
  <p> She nears it and the turbolift door opens.</p>
  <p>8 A MAN</p>
  <p> HAGAN sits cross-legged on the floor of the turbolift,<br>
    staring straight ahead. Beverly moves toward him,<br>
    scans him. Riker and Worf, taking no chances, keep<br>
    their phasers on him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He's alive...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I think he is Betazoid...</p>
  <p> She knees down close to him, trying to make contact.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 12/17/90 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's all right. We're going to<br>
    help you.</p>
  <p> The man offers one soft, shuddering intake of air...<br>
    but no more.</p>
  <p>9 TROI</p>
  <p> holds his shoulders, looking into his eyes.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What happened here? Who did this<br>
    to you?</p>
  <p> But there is no answer. The man stares past them, lost<br>
    in a catatonic void.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>10 INT. ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - SOME TIME LATER</p>
  <p> Picard watches with Beverly as a SUPERNUMERARY wheels<br>
    away a form in a body bag.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We're almost finished with the<br>
    autopsies, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long will it take you to<br>
    compile the data?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's complicated -- the dead were<br>
    found everywhere... some locked<br>
    in their rooms -- barricaded, with<br>
    weapons piled around them... some<br>
    in corridors where they'd<br>
    obviously had hand-to-hand<br>
    combat... I'll have to sort<br>
    through and analyze the details.</p>
  <p> Picard glances toward a bio-bed, where Troi sits with<br>
    the Betazoid man.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We've identified him as Andrus<br>
    Hagan, from Betazed, science<br>
    advisor. He's in a profound<br>
    catatonic state.</p>
  <p> Picard walks toward Troi.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm not getting much, Captain...<br>
    a few words, disconnected phrases.<br>
    I can feel his terror... but I<br>
    can't seem to reach him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Don't give up on him, Counselor.<br>
    We're examining the Brattain for<br>
    clues -- but this man is the only<br>
    one left who knows what happened<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> Picard turns and EXITS, and Troi turns back to Hagan.<br>
    She is trying to engage his mind telepathically.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 1/9/91 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI (V.O.)<br>
    I'm here. I'm right here.<br>
    There's nothing to be afraid of<br>
    anymore.</p>
  <p> HAGAN (V.O.)<br>
    ... out there... voices...</p>
  <p> TROI (V.O.)<br>
    You hear voices? What do they<br>
    say?</p>
  <p> HAGAN (V.O.)<br>
    ... both things... no... no...</p>
  <p> TROI (V.O.)<br>
    Keep talking to me... I'll try<br>
    to understand...</p>

  <p>12 EXT. SPACE - BRATTAIN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The small ship hangs in space.</p>
  <p>13 INT. BRATTAIN - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data and Riker at the computers. GEORDI ENTERS from<br>
    the turbolift.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 1/9/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    All engines check out perfectly,<br>
    Commander. Once we get them<br>
    started up, the Brattain can get<br>
    back to Starbase under her own<br>
    power.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's give it a try.</p>
  <p> Geordi takes his place at a science station near Data.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Pre-heating injectors... Data,<br>
    fuel flow?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Matter valves are open and<br>
    operating. Magnetic containment<br>
    on the anti-matter pods is<br>
    constant.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay, open injectors.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Injectors open.</p>
  <p> They wait. There's nothing.</p>

  <p>13 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is no engine activity at<br>
    all.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's wrong, Geordi?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Nothing's wrong. I don't<br>
    understand it.</p>
  <p> Off his puzzlement...</p>
  <p>14 INT. ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard working at his desk. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Beverly ENTERS carrying a Padd.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've been studying the autopsy<br>
    reports... the conclusion is<br>
    appalling.</p>
  <p> Picard gives her a look -- strong words from this<br>
    dispassionate scientist.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There was no outside source...<br>
    no alien presence... The crew of<br>
    the Brattain, all thirty-four of<br>
    them -- appear to have killed each<br>
    other.</p>
  <p> Picard is taken aback by this conclusion.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What could have caused such an<br>
    event? Drugs? A virus?<br>
    Poison...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Toxicological tests showed no<br>
    unusual substances in their<br>
    systems. And they were in good<br>
    health.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 12/19/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But for whatever reason, they seem<br>
    to have turned against each other,<br>
    using phasers, knives -- and bare<br>
    hands.</p>
  <p> Beverly programs information into the Captain's<br>
    computer.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'd like you to see this, Captain.<br>
    It's from the logs of the<br>
    Brattain. Captain Zaheva's mental<br>
    condition deteriorated steadily<br>
    after they became stranded... she<br>
    began talking of plots and<br>
    mutinies...</p>
  <p> She activates the computer.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    This is the last entry... made<br>
    after they had been adrift for<br>
    over three weeks.</p>
  <p> They turn toward the monitor.</p>
  <p>15 ANGLE - MONITOR - INTERCUTTING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Captain Zaheva, sitting in the same chair where she<br>
    was found, is a wreck... eyes red-rimmed, voice hoarse,<br>
    endlessly brushing the side of her head in a compulsive<br>
    gesture.</p>
  <p> CAPTAIN ZAHEVA<br>
    First Officer Brink and his men<br>
    were behind it... they got to the<br>
    engines... don't work anymore...<br>
    had to eliminate Brink... the<br>
    ship is out of... out of... we're<br>
    running out... too dangerous...<br>
    out of Brink... and his men...</p>
  <p> Her eyes flick upward, there is a brief moment of<br>
    terror, and then the screen goes blank. Mystery upon<br>
    mystery. Picard stares at Beverly, perplexed, mind<br>
    churning to understand what happened on the stricken<br>
    science vessel.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 1/4/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>16 INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Troi is leaving Sickbay, speaks to a SUPERNUMERARY.<br>
    (PRODUCTION NOTE: This is the beginning of the dream<br>
    sequence, but should seem perfectly normal.)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Be sure to call me if there's any<br>
    change in his condition. I'll<br>
    be in my office.</p>
  <p> She turns and proceeds down the corridor. She passes<br>
    a turbolift; the door opens and several CREW MEMBERS<br>
    spill out, going their way. She smiles, greeting them,<br>
    and passes through the bustling activity. DOLLY with<br>
    her as she proceeds down the corridor to --</p>
  <p>17 TROI'S OFFICE DOOR</p>
  <p> As it opens, she ENTERS.</p>
  <p>18 INT. NIGHTMARE ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Suddenly Troi steps into a bizarre surreality. She<br>
    spins to find the door she entered. It is gone. She<br>
    turns back to see she is in...</p>
  <p>19 A MURKY VOID (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A strange, empty cavity where everything is fuzzy,<br>
    smoky, gaseous. Vague shapes seem to loom in the<br>
    distance but have no substance. At a great distance,<br>
    there are two pinpoints of light... the mists swirl<br>
    in front of them, obscuring them. A RUSTLING SOUND,<br>
    maybe wind, maybe a cry, seems to come from within the<br>
    shadowy depths. It is an ominous, menacing sound,<br>
    suggesting a demon lurking in the mists. Troi finds<br>
    herself floating... drifting helplessly in the clouds.<br>
    It is frightening to be so out of control.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Where are you?</p>
  <p> She reaches out both arms in front of her, fearful,<br>
    like a sightless person feeling her way through<br>
    unfamiliar territory. The rustling SOUND becomes a<br>
    low, throaty voice... sighing, raspy, foreboding.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 1/4/91 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>20 ANOTHER ANGLE ON TROI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as she is drawn toward the sinister sound, unable to<br>
    resist. She drifts further into the vaporous<br>
    landscape, seeking the source. But she cannot control<br>
    her direction.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm coming. Where are you?</p>
  <p> Struggling forward, Troi tries to free herself. The<br>
    throaty sound becomes louder... takes shape...</p>
  <p> SIGHING VOICE<br>
    Eyes... in the dark... one moon...<br>
    circles...</p>
  <p> Troi is swimming in space, frantically trying to move<br>
    forward as the voice becomes louder...</p>
  <p> SIGHING VOICE<br>
    See the eyes... in the dark...<br>
    one moon...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Where are you?!</p>
  <p>21 INT. ENTERPRISE - TROI'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Troi, in her bed, sits up with a start. She is moist<br>
    with perspiration, breathing hard in terror from the<br>
    bizarre nightmare.</p>

    Captain's log, Stardate 44635.8:<br>
    Four days have passed, but we have<br>
    made little progress in solving<br>
    the mystery of the Brattain. I<br>
    have decided we will return to<br>
    Starbase Two-twenty...</p>
  <p>23 INT. BRATTAIN - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Geordi and ENSIGN PEEPLES at a work station.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    ... and to that end, Commander La<br>
    Forge is rigging the Brattain for<br>
    towing.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (rising)<br>
    I'm going to try re-calibrating<br>
    the field generators. I still<br>
    don't see why we can't get the<br>
    engines going... it just doesn't<br>
    make any sense.</p>
  <p>24 CLOSE ON PEEPLES</p>
  <p> as he concentrates on his task, tapping out<br>
    instructions. As he does, we begin to hear a SOUND...<br>
    a hollow, deadened CLUNG... as though something were<br>
    hitting a pipe somewhere far below.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 12/17/90 - ACT TWO 14.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> It hits once, twice... only now does Peeples seem to<br>
    hear it. He lifts his head, straining to hear better.<br>
    The sound increases in volume, and he stands in alarm.</p>
  <p> PEEPLES<br>
    Someone's still here...</p>
  <p> The sound gets louder still, a chilling, insistent cry.<br>
    Peeples looks panicked.</p>
  <p> PEEPLES<br>
    They're alive!</p>
  <p>25 ANGLE - GEORDI AND PEEPLES</p>
  <p> As soon as Geordi is included in the shot, the SOUND<br>
    disappears. Geordi is staring at the Ensign.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Ensign... what is it?</p>
  <p>26 ON PEEPLES</p>
  <p> Now, the sound is loud and clear.</p>
  <p> PEEPLES<br>
    Can't you hear it? There's<br>
    someone left alive on the ship!</p>
  <p>27 ANGLE - GEORDI AND PEEPLES</p>
  <p> Geordi's stare catches Peeples' attention, and then<br>
    he realizes he's not hearing anything.</p>
  <p> PEEPLES<br>
    I heard... I mean, I thought I<br>
    heard something.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The ship was searched thoroughly.<br>
    There's no one left aboard.</p>
  <p> Geordi's look of concern embarrasses the young Ensign.</p>
  <p> PEEPLES<br>
    Sorry, sir. My mistake.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 1/4/91 - ACT TWO 15.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (gently)<br>
    Thirty-four people were found dead<br>
    on this ship. That could make<br>
    anyone uneasy.</p>
  <p> PEEPLES<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> And he bends again to his task.</p>
  <p>28 INT. ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Troi sits by the bio-bed where Hagan lies.</p>
  <p> TROI (V.O.)<br>
    I'm here... can you hear me?</p>
  <p> Hagan stirs vaguely.</p>
  <p> TROI (V.O.)<br>
    Tell me about the voices you<br>
    hear...</p>
  <p> HAGAN (V.O.)<br>
    Bright... one pole... two<br>
    poles...</p>
  <p> TROI (V.O.)<br>
    I don't understand... tell me more<br>
    about the poles...</p>
  <p> But he just stares out at nothing.</p>
  <p>29 INT. ENTERPRISE - O'BRIEN'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> O'Brien paces in the front room, disquieted. Presently<br>
    the door opens and Keiko comes bustling in, happy to<br>
    see him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 1/4/91 - ACT TWO 16.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Boy, what a day this was... I'm<br>
    doing an isozyme study on some<br>
    populations of Cardilia... but<br>
    they're turning out to have some<br>
    really weird polymorphisms.<br>
    What a headache!</p>
  <p> She is breathless, full of her day, chattering.<br>
    O'Brien eyes her, speaks with ominous quietness.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Is that why you were late?</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Oh, no, I had a conference with<br>
    Doctor Balthus... she wants to<br>
    do a study on the laticifer<br>
    ontogeny of the Kaladian Thorn<br>
    Flower... but I don't have the<br>
    time to oversee another project...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Was Tom Corbin there?</p>
  <p> She stops, stares at him, for the first time aware of<br>
    his strange mood.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Tom Corbin. From the science lab.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Remember him?</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Of course I remember him, but --</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    You use any excuse to pay him a<br>
    visit...</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    (nonplussed)<br>
    Miles... what are you saying--?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I think you know exactly what I'm<br>
    saying.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 1/7/91 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> She regards him a minute, then smiles, walks toward<br>
    him. This is unlike Miles to be so grumpy, but that's<br>
    okay... she can tweak him out of it.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    If I didn't know better... I'd<br>
    say you're jealous.</p>
  <p> She puts her arms around him, starts to kiss him, but<br>
    he takes her wrists and holds her away. She is amazed.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    You take me for a fool?</p>
  <p> And with that he turns and EXITS. She stares after<br>
    him, astonished.</p>
  <p>30 INT. ENTERPRISE - TEN-FORWARD - LATER</p>
  <p> O'Brien ENTERS, spots his friend CHIEF GILLESPIE<br>
    sitting at the bar. Gillespie is older than O'Brien,<br>
    weathered and salty. O'Brien walks over and joins him.<br>
    GUINAN is behind the bar.</p>
  <p> GILLESPIE<br>
    Hello, Chief... have some coffee?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I've been drinking too much<br>
    coffee... maybe some hot tea,<br>
    Guinan?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Coming up.</p>
  <p> She moves away and Gillespie looks at O'Brien, grins.</p>
  <p> GILLESPIE<br>
    Kind of a surprise to see you<br>
    in here at this hour.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    How's that?</p>
  <p> GILLESPIE<br>
    You're not out of the honeymoon<br>
    yet... usually newlyweds can't<br>
    keep their hands off each other...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 12/19/90 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> O'Brien gives a shrug. Guinan brings his tea.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    She has work to do. She heads<br>
    up the plant biology lab, you<br>
    know.</p>
  <p> GILLESPIE<br>
    Any strange things going on down<br>
    there?</p>
  <p> O'Brien gives him a quick look -- what strange things?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Like what?</p>
  <p> Gillespie leans in to him.</p>
  <p> GILLESPIE<br>
    I've been hearing things...<br>
    Kenicki, in Engineering... told<br>
    me he saw a man in an old<br>
    Starfleet uniform... riding the<br>
    lift near the engine core... but<br>
    when the lift got to the top...<br>
    there was no one on it...</p>
  <p> O'Brien shakes his head scornfully.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Ghost stories...</p>
  <p> GILLESPIE<br>
    There's more... lots more.<br>
    Strange things are happening on<br>
    this ship, O'Brien...</p>
  <p> O'Brien gulps his tea, rises.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I'm surprised at you, Gillespie...<br>
    a Starfleet officer...<br>
    (leans in to him)<br>
    I have more to worry about than<br>
    shades and spirits...</p>
  <p> And he leaves.</p>

  <p> Picard is at his desk, working. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> He glances up, but the doors don't open. He's involved<br>
    in his monitor, doesn't give it a thought. Then the<br>
    CHIME again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (a bit more forcefully)<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> He looks at the door. It is shut. He rises, and the<br>
    CHIME sounds again. He goes to the door, it opens;<br>
    there's no one there. He shakes his head in annoyance,<br>
    goes back to his desk, sits. The CHIME sounds. He<br>
    ignores it. It SOUNDS again; he is getting irritated<br>
    but doesn't respond. Finally, there is a KNOCK at the<br>
    door. He looks up, surprised.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come...</p>
  <p> The door opens and Beverly and Troi are there. They<br>
    ENTER.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain, do you have a moment?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We're concerned... whatever<br>
    happened on the Brattain -- may be<br>
    starting here.</p>
  <p> Picard immediately takes notice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Explain...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Beverly and I have both gotten<br>
    unusual reports... people behaving<br>
    strangely... others hearing<br>
    sounds that aren't there...</p>
  <p> Picard gives her a sharp look at this.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes. Captain -- we have to get<br>
    the Enterprise away from here...<br>
    before it gets worse...</p>
  <p> Picard glances at her... it's a bit of a panicky<br>
    response for this usually stoic scientist.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are preparing to take the<br>
    Brattain in tow. We'll be on our<br>

  <p> RAGER<br>
    Aye, sir...</p>
  <p> Ensign Rager starts to tap instructions, then<br>
    hesitates. Data glances over. She stares at her<br>
    console. Picard rises, approaches to see what's<br>
    wrong.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Is there a problem, Ensign?</p>
  <p> RAGER<br>
    I... can't seem to remember how<br>

  <p> Rager, shamed, glances around at Picard.</p>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 44639.9.<br>
    We have now been adrift for a<br>
    total of ten days. We have sent<br>
    sub-space distress calls, but<br>
    because of our distant location,<br>
    we cannot expect a response for<br>
    at least another two weeks.</p>
  <p>38 INT. ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> At the table sit Picard, Riker, Troi, Beverly, and<br>
    Geordi. Data stands at the monitor. The staff is<br>
    looking a little ragged... mildly disheveled, slightly<br>
    on edge. Riker drums his fingers on the table. Picard<br>
    tugs at his collar in an unconscious, compulsive<br>
    gesture. Troi looks more exhausted than ever. Data,<br>
    of course, is unchanged.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

  <p> He activates the monitor, which shows an OKUDAGRAM. It<br>

    You mean... a Tyken's Rift...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    A what?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A rare anomaly named for Bela<br>
    Tyken, the Melthusian Captain who<br>
    first encountered it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    A Tyken's Rift -- of course...<br>

    When Tyken was trapped in a Rift,<br>
    his analysis determined that a<br>
    massive energy release might<br>
    overload and dislocate the<br>
    anomaly. Fortunately, his cargo<br>
    included anicium and yurium, which<br>
    he used to detonate a massive<br>
    explosion. He then escaped<br>
    through the ruptured center of<br>
    the Rift.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>

  <p>44 PICARD</p>
  <p> stares upward in shock.</p>
  <p>45 INT. ENTERPRISE - RIKER'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS, then stops and listens warily, as though<br>
    hearing something. He scans the room. Then he shakes<br>
    it off, proceeds toward the bedroom.</p>
  <p>46 INT. ENTERPRISE - TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Picard stares upward in horror, backing to a wall,<br>
    holding up a hand as though to ward off the ceiling.</p>
  <p>47 TURBOLIFT CEILING - HIS POV</p>
  <p> continues its downward plunge.</p>
  <p>48 PICARD</p>
  <p> sinks to his knees.</p>
  <p>49 INT. ENTERPRISE - RIKER'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS, studies the room, moves through it<br>
    cautiously. He turns and looks back at the door he<br>
    just entered.</p>
  <p>50 INT. ENTERPRISE - TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Picard looks upward, shielding his head as --</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    No! No!</p>
  <p>53 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The turbolift door opens. Worf, at his station, looks<br>
    over to see --</p>
  <p>54 PICARD</p>
  <p> huddled on the floor in terror, hands protectively over<br>
    his head.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No... stop... no...</p>
  <p>55 ANGLE ON WORF</p>
  <p> as he moves toward the Captain, staring in amazement.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir... ?</p>
  <p> Picard gradually looks around, sees the others staring<br>
    at him. He pulls himself up, glances up at the ceiling<br>
    of the turbolift -- safely in its place. He rises and<br>
    EXITS, struggling to maintain his dignity.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As you were.</p>
  <p> Worf watches as the Captain proceeds to his chair.<br>
    Worf registers nothing. Then, Picard hesitates,<br>
    addresses Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data... in my Ready Room,<br>
    please...</p>
  <p>56 INT. ENTERPRISE - RIKER'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM</p>
  <p> Dressed in a sleep robe, he goes to his bed, takes the<br>
    cover and starts to flip it back. Then he whirls<br>
    suddenly, looking behind him.</p>
  <p>57 THE ROOM - HIS POV</p>
  <p> Quiet, still -- empty.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 1/4/91 - ACT THREE 32-32A. </p>
  <p>58 BACK TO RIKER</p>
  <p> as he slides into bed under the cover. Then he reacts<br>
    in surprise. He reaches down, flips off the cover and<br>
    sees --</p>
  <p>59 THE BED</p>
  <p> is a writhing nest of snakes, dozens of them, squirming<br>
    and churning, covering the bed, slithering off onto<br>
    the floor.</p>
  <p>60 RIKER</p>
  <p> yells in alarm, leaps out of bed. He looks down again.</p>
  <p>61 THE BED - HIS POV</p>
  <p> is empty of snakes.</p>
  <p>62 RIKER</p>
  <p> Heart pounding, he stands there for a moment, catching<br>
    his breath.</p>
  <p>63 INT. ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard with Data. The Captain has been profoundly<br>
    shaken by his experience in the turbolift.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, Commander La Forge and I have<br>
    come up with a potential solution<br>
    to our predicament. Perhaps the<br>
    modifications we used to increase<br>
    firepower against the Borg might<br>
    be effective here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Channeling power into the main<br>
    deflector dish...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe within six hours we<br>
    can generate a concentrated burst<br>
    of energy which might disrupt the<br>
    Tyken's Rift.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 1/4/91 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. Proceed.</p>
  <p> Data starts toward the door, but Picard stops him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (turning back)<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> Picard speaks with difficulty.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Apparently... I am not immune...<br>
    to the strange forces at work on<br>
    this ship...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> This is painful for Picard, to whom control is so<br>
    important.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's a frightening prospect...<br>
    to lose control of your mind...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    When I was young, I saw my<br>
    grandfather deteriorate... from<br>
    a powerful, robust figure... to<br>
    a -- a frail wisp of a man, who<br>
    couldn't even remember how to make<br>
    his way home...</p>
  <p> He draws a breath, shakes off this dire memory.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is my responsibility...<br>
    somehow... to see that this ship<br>
    is guided to safety. I will have<br>
    to rely on you, from now on...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We may need to count on you for<br>
    our very survival.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. I will do my best.</p>

  <p>64 INT. ENTERPRISE - CARGO AREA/MORGUE</p>
  <p> Beverly speaks to a SUPERNUMERARY. They are in a hold<br>
    which contains the covered bodies of the Brattain crew.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I want to do more cross-sections<br>
    on the brain tissue of some of<br>
    these bodies. Set up the positron<br>
    emission sensors in Sickbay...<br>
    I'll decide which ones I want to<br>
    study.</p>
  <p> The assistant nods and EXITS. Beverly approaches a<br>
    corpse, lifts the attached autopsy report, reads it.<br>
    A sudden sound... a thunk behind her... makes her look<br>
    around.</p>
  <p>65 THE MORGUE</p>
  <p> has an eerie look... bodies in translucent bags, held<br>
    in stasis by (invisible) force fields, casting shadows<br>
    on the floor and walls... but nothing is apparent which<br>
    caused the noise.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 12/17/90 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>66 BEVERLY</p>
  <p> returns to her study. She moves to another corpse,<br>
    reads the report. Then, a rustling noise... she looks<br>
    up and sees --</p>
  <p>67 A BODY</p>
  <p> sitting up, as if staring at her.</p>
  <p>68 BEVERLY</p>
  <p> gasps, then turns to see that the body next to her has<br>
    sat up, also. She backs up, turns -- sees another<br>
    upright... turns again... sees several of them...<br>
    spins... and now...</p>
  <p>69 THE BODIES</p>
  <p> have all sat upright, as though staring at her...</p>
  <p>70 BEVERLY</p>
  <p> closes her eyes. This is a hallucination. Nothing<br>
    more. She speaks firmly, but calmly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Go away.</p>
  <p> She opens her eyes.</p>
  <p>71 THE ROOM</p>
  <p> is as it was, bodies shrouded on their pads.</p>
  <p>72 BEVERLY</p>
  <p> fights for control... quiets her pounding heart.</p>
  <p>73 INT. ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Beverly is with Picard and Data.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 12/19/90 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>73 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain, let me ask you this:<br>
    since we located the Brattain...<br>
    can you remember any of your<br>
    dreams?</p>
  <p> Picard stares at her, perplexed. It's hard enough to<br>
    concentrate... but what does this have to do with<br>
    anything?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hardly ever remember dreams...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    A lot of people don't... but<br>
    think... have you had a dream in<br>
    the last ten days?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (struggles with it)<br>
    I... don't recall...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm betting you haven't. What's<br>
    more, neither has anyone else on<br>
    board this ship -- except Troi.<br>
    I began to realize it when she<br>
    talked about her nightmares.</p>
  <p> Picard stares at her, trying to stay with her.<br>
    Beverly, too, is ragged, faltering.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've done additional brain tissue<br>
    tests on some of the bodies from<br>
    the... the...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Brattain...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    ... and scans on a random<br>
    cross-section of our crew. They<br>
    all show the same result... a<br>
    unique chemical imbalance.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Caused by -- ?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Dream deprivation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 12/19/90 - ACT THREE 35A.</p>
  <p>73 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard looks at her quizzically.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Every night... we... we enter<br>
    into... sleep...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 12/20/90 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>73 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Beverly is losing it, not able to concentrate on what<br>
    she was saying. Data fills the gap.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe the Doctor means to say<br>
    that humans enter what is known<br>
    as REM sleep... rapid eye<br>
    movement. It is the level of<br>
    brain-wave activity at which you<br>
    dream.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We need dreams to survive... if<br>
    we don't get REM sleep, we don't<br>
    dream, and we begin to lose our<br>
    -- cognitive abilities... it<br>
    becomes hard to concentrate...<br>
    we forget... how to do the most<br>
    ordinary task.</p>
  <p> Picard is listening intently. It's becoming clear.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Then... we become irritable...<br>
    paranoid... some people<br>
    experience hallucinations...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're describing the situation<br>
    on this ship... But Counselor<br>
    Troi has reported nightmares...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Maybe it's because she's Betazoid.<br>
    I don't know... but there's<br>
    something more going on here than<br>
    being stuck in a Tyken's Rift...<br>
    and I don't know how or why it's<br>
    happening...</p>
  <p> She draws a breath, fixes him with a steady look.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 12/17/90 - ACT THREE 37.</p>
  <p>73 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But I do know this. There is an<br>
    inevitable conclusion to this<br>
    pattern. If I can't find a way<br>
    to reverse it -- we are all going<br>
    to go insane.</p>
  <p> Picard's look reflects the enormity of the statement.<br>
    His gaze swings to Data: he, of course, would survive.<br>
    Data is imperturbed by the implications.</p>

  <p>77 BACK IN SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Troi's eyes blink open and she sits up, looking around<br>
    fuzzily, realizes she was dreaming. She turns to<br>
    Hagan.</p>
  <p> TROI (V.O.)<br>
    I'm still here... I haven't gone<br>
    anywhere...</p>
  <p> Hagan stirs vaguely.</p>

    Do you remember anything more?</p>
  <p> HAGAN (V.O.)<br>
    ...double... double...</p>
  <p> TROI (V.O.)<br>
    What does that mean? Is something<br>
    doubled?</p>

  <p> A few desultory souls... the mood is nervous, somber --<br>
    not a happy place. Guinan circulates; you sense she's<br>
    keeping tensions under control. Gillespie is there,<br>
    and not in good shape... irritable, impulsive. He's<br>
    trying to garner support.</p>
  <p> GILLESPIE<br>
    I think... it's some kind of<br>

    You couldn't be more wrong...</p>

    It's like we're laboratory<br>

    and wait for death to sneak up<br>
    behind me...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    What's that supposed to mean?</p>
  <p> Gillespie glances around, leans in.</p>
  <p> GILLESPIE<br>
    You heard about them on the<br>
    Brattain... shut in their<br>

  <p> Data ENTERS to find Geordi. Geordi is not in good<br>

    nurturing, gentle.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What is it you feel?</p>
  <p> Worf stares at her, agonizing. The admission is almost<br>
    too overwhelming for him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I feel... fear.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf... to admit that you are<br>
    afraid... gives you strength.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at her, allows her to grip his hand.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Something is waiting for us...<br>
    I am not strong enough to fight<br>
    it...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, Worf. It is just an illusion.<br>
    It is not real.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Please... put down the knife.</p>
  <p> He hesitates, stares at her, wrestles with his proud<br>
    warrior's sensibility. But Troi's compassion has<br>
    inspired trust. He holds for a beat... then lowers<br>
    the knife... puts it on a table. Then, the SECURITY<br>
    GUARDS hurry in.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's all right. Everything is<br>
    fine. Thank you.</p>
  <p> Puzzled and uncertain, they retreat. Worf never takes<br>
    his eyes off Troi. She holds out her hand to him.</p>

  <p>101 INT. ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data, Troi, Beverly, and Picard. The others are<br>
    noticeable by their absence. The group that is there,<br>
    except for Data, is in bad shape. They are unkempt,<br>
    hair in disarray and eyes red-rimmed. They are on the<br>
    edge of an emotional abyss, all struggling mightily to<br>
    keep from toppling over. Beverly is unable to sit<br>
    still, and keeps jumping up to pace. Picard is<br>
    straining to remain cogent, but keeps his hands tightly<br>
    clasped, as though to hold onto sanity. Troi is<br>
    possessed of an urgency that threatens to overwhelm<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    REM sleep occurs at a different<br>
    frequency for Betazoids than other<br>
    humanoids... I believe these<br>
    beings are using that frequency<br>
    to communicate telepathically...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is conceivable that this<br>
    telepathic communication is<br>
    creating an interference that<br>
    prevents REM sleep in other<br>
    species -- that would be an<br>
    explanation for why the rest<br>
    of the crew is not dreaming.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor... what are these --<br>
    beings -- trying to tell us?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    They're calling for help. I think<br>
    they're trapped just like we are.<br>
    &quot;Eyes in the dark&quot;... could mean<br>
    this twin star system...</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Your hypothesis is certainly<br>
    plausible.</p>
  <p> Data goes to the monitor and snaps on the same OKUDAGRAM<br>
    he used in describing the Tyken's Rift.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It may well be that there is<br>
    another ship... on the other side<br>
    of the fissure... where we<br>
    cannot detect it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Is there any way... to block their<br>
    signals?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We have no technology to block<br>
    telepathic transmissions, Doctor.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Maybe... communication through<br>
    dreams can work both ways... I<br>
    could try to get them to stop...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps we can accomplish more<br>
    than that. If we could coordinate<br>
    our efforts with these beings...<br>
    we might work together to free<br>
    ourselves.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It is conceivable... in working<br>
    with patients who have<br>
    debilitating nightmares, I have<br>
    often used a therapetuic treament<br>
    known as &quot;directed dreaming&quot;...</p>
  <p> The others look at her, trying to hang on to what she's<br>
    saying. It's all they can do to comprehend it.</p>

    Dreamers can learn to take control<br>
    of their dreams... retain a<br>

    be able to remember a short<br>
    message.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If it's... possible... what would<br>
    you say... ?</p>

  <p>101A INT. BRIDGE - SCIENCE STATION - MONITOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Widen to reveal Troi sitting with Data as he taps more<br>

    scrolls on the monitor -- atomic diagrams of<br>
    elements accompany the text. Troi stares at them,<br>
    intrigued.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What we must discover is a means<br>
    by which, working together with<br>
    the aliens, we can produce an<br>
    explosion more intense than either<br>
    of us could achieve alone.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What is it you're looking for?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    These are the elements we have<br>
    available. Some of them could<br>
    be used in the creation of an<br>
    explosive reaction. If we can<br>
    communicate this inventory to<br>
    the other ship, perhaps they will<br>
    be able to --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, Data... that's too complex.<br>
    This has to be a simple, clear<br>
    message...</p>

  <p> TROI (O.C.)<br>
    Further back... there. Stop.</p>
  <p> The monitor stops on a readout describing a hydrogen<br>
    atom; next to it is the diagram -- one electron<br>
    circling one proton.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    &quot;One... moon... circles... &quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (curious)<br>
    Yes, Counselor, one electron<br>
    circles one proton... this is a<br>
    hydrogen atom.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    &quot;One moon circles&quot;... that's what<br>
    they have been telling me... over<br>
    and over...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps the aliens are thinking<br>
    as we are... to collaborate in<br>
    producing an explosion. If<br>
    hydrogen is combined with certain<br>
    elements... calendenium, for<br>
    example, it is extremely volatile.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But... would the message mean they<br>
    have hydrogen... or want<br>
    hydrogen?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If it is a distress call, they'd<br>
    be asking for what they need...<br>
    not what they already have.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then a proper course of action<br>
    would be for us to release<br>
    hydrogen into the Rift and hope<br>
    that they have a substance which<br>
    could detonate it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How do I tell them what to do?</p>

    If you are correct, Counselor,<br>
    I believe they have already told<br>
    us what to do... and are waiting<br>
    for us to do it. When we are<br>
    ready the only message you should<br>
    try to convey is, &quot;Now!&quot;</p>
  <p>102 INT. ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY</p>

    concentration.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can help keep you in REM sleep<br>
    for a while with this cortical<br>
    scanner... it will maintain<br>
    electrical activity in your brain<br>

    Two minutes, is that all, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Unfortunately, yes. We have only<br>

  <p> as Picard and Data see the explosion, roiling and<br>
    raging. There is a hum as power is restored and lights<br>
    snap on. Picard rises... instinctively knowing what to<br>
    do...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 1/4/91 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>132 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Activate impulse engines...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Engines activated, sir...</p>
  <p> Data presses several panels on his Ops pad.</p>
  <p>133 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> grabs power, accelerates, skims through the last sparks<br>
    of the diminishing explosion... directly into the<br>
    center of the rift...</p>
  <p> And passing it, going the opposite direction... a<br>
    shapeless mass... a sparkling energy field... the<br>
    other ship.</p>
  <p>134 INT. ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Troi smiles... then her eyes flutter open as she comes<br>
    awake.</p>
  <p>135 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise clears the event and emerges into the<br>
    quiet starfield once more.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We have cleared the rift, sir.<br>
    Warp engines are coming back on<br>
    line.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Set a course...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - REV. 12/20/90 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>135 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Setting a course for Starbase<br>
    Two-twenty. Sir, as my final<br>
    duty as Acting Captain, I order<br>
    you to bed. I shall do the same<br>
    for all personnel.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well, Mister Data...</p>
  <p> He rises, pauses.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And... thank you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. Pleasant dreams.</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS the Bridge, and Data, alone, implacably<br>
    pilots the ship toward safe harbor.</p>
  <p>136 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the ship streaks away.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
