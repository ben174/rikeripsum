    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. STARBASE 133 - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> is docked at this starbase on the edge of a planetary<br>
    system. A planet is clearly visible.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (V.O.)<br>
    Chief Medical Officer's log,<br>
    Stardate 44161.2. We are docked<br>
    at Starbase One-Three-Three for<br>
    scheduled crew rotation. I look<br>
    forward to welcoming aboard my<br>
    mentor, and dear friend, Doctor<br>
    Dalen Quaice, who will be<br>
    traveling with us to his home<br>
    planet, Kenda Two.</p>
  <p>2 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY stands waiting patiently. O'BRIEN is at the<br>
    console. A quite elderly man in a Starfleet uniform<br>
    MATERIALIZES on the Transporter pad: DALEN QUAICE. He<br>
    carries a small bag. As he steps slowly off the pad,<br>
    Beverly moves to embrace him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Dalen!</p>
  <p> QUAICE<br>
    It's good to see you again,<br>
    Beverly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You look wonderful.</p>
  <p> QUAICE<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    A lie I can live with. It's kind<br>
    of your captain to ferry me home.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's on our way.<br>
    (to O'Brien)<br>
    Thank you, Chief.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Remember Me&quot; - REV. 8/21/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    My pleasure, Doctor.</p>
  <p> Beverly and Quaice EXIT.</p>
  <p>3 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> As Beverly and Quaice walk along.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Dalen, I was sorry to hear about<br>
    Patricia.</p>
  <p> QUAICE<br>
    She'd been ill for some time.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Is her death the reason you're<br>
    giving up your post here?</p>
  <p> QUAICE<br>
    (nods)<br>
    We had a lifetime together, doing<br>
    all the things we'd ever dreamed.<br>
    And more. But when she was gone,<br>
    I couldn't continue to work in<br>
    that office, sleep in that bed<br>
    without her... the absence of<br>
    her was too... distracting...<br>
    (shakes his head)<br>
    I'm not sure I'm making any sense.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jack and I didn't have a lifetime,<br>
    only a few short years. But I<br>
    understand. When you realize<br>
    someone you love is lost<br>
    forever...</p>
  <p> She shakes her head.</p>
  <p> QUAICE<br>
    You know what the worst part of<br>
    growing old is? So many of the<br>
    people you've known all your<br>
    life are gone... and you realize<br>
    you didn't take the time to<br>
    appreciate them while you still<br>
    could...<br>
    (MORE)</p>

  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> QUAICE (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm sorry. There was no reason<br>
    to heap all this emotional baggage<br>
    on you.<br>
    (indicates bag)<br>
    I usually travel light.</p>
  <p> She puts her arm through his, comforting him, as they<br>
    walk on. Her face is reflective as she thinks about<br>
    what he said.</p>
  <p>4 INT. ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> WESLEY is immersed in work at a computer as GEORDI and<br>
    a couple of SUPERNUMERARIES make final preparations for<br>
    departure.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Wes, time for the experiment is<br>
    over... I want my warp engines<br>
    back. Now.</p>
  <p> Beverly ENTERS, stands near the warp drive, watching<br>
    Wesley in silence, Quaice's words still fresh in her<br>
    mind.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (working furiously)<br>
    Almost done, Commander.</p>
  <p> On his computer screen is the CAD representation of<br>
    his experiment: the warp drive and a network of<br>
    shifting lines of energy forming a distinctively-shaped<br>
    bubble within it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Almost isn't good enough. You<br>
    want to explain when the Captain<br>
    says &quot;Engage,&quot; and we just sit<br>
    here?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Just a couple more minutes! I'm<br>
    ready to try the new warp field!<br>
    (sees Beverly)<br>
    Mom?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (pensive)<br>
    Don't let me interrupt.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Remember Me&quot; - REV. 8/17/90 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (on the fly)<br>
    Hi!</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Wes!</p>
  <p>4A EXCLUDE BEVERLY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Right! Okay!</p>
  <p> His fingers dance across the console. On the computer<br>
    screen the bubble suddenly flares larger. There's an<br>
    odd flash of light, almost subliminal, but everybody<br>
    notices it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Computer, level two diagnostic<br>
    on warp drive systems.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Antimatter containment positive.<br>
    Warp drive within normal<br>
    parameters.</p>
  <p> Geordi hurries over to Wesley.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Talk to me.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (stunned)<br>
    That shouldn't have happened.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Ensign Crusher --</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Why would there be any visible<br>
    phenomena outside the drive?</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Umbilical disconnect.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Are you done?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Uh, yeah...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Remember Me&quot; - REV. 8/17/90 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Geordi quickly returns to his station. Wesley saves<br>
    his work, shuts down the experiment, looks around for<br>
    his mother.</p>
  <p>4B ANGLE - FAVORING WESLEY'S P.O.V.</p>
  <p> Beverly has gone.</p>
  <p>4C BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Clear all moorings. Engineering,<br>
    aft thrusters.</p>
  <p> Geordi stabs at his console, his team working quickly,<br>
    but methodically around him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aft thrusters, aye. Impulse power<br>
    to the helm.</p>
  <p> Wesley starts to go, stops, shoots a last concerned<br>
    look around Engineering.</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> moves away from the starbase.</p>
  <p>6 OMITTED</p>
  <p>7 INT. CORRIDOR - THE NEXT MORNING</p>
  <p> Beverly steps off a turbolift, heads for the door to<br>
    some guest quarters, activates the door chimes. There<br>
    is no acknowledgement. She tries again, then causes<br>
    the door to open.</p>
  <p>8 INT. QUAICE'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Beverly ENTERS, looks around the room. Nothing looks<br>
    disturbed.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Dalen?<br>
    (no reply)<br>
    Dalen, it's Beverly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Remember Me&quot; - REV. 8/17/90 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She keys her communicator.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Computer, current location of<br>
    Doctor Dalen Quaice.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    There is no Doctor Dalen Quaice<br>
    aboard the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> As Beverly reacts, we:</p>

  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>10 INT. QUAICE'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Beverly is waiting when the door opens. WORF ENTERS.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Lieutenant Worf, yesterday, before<br>
    we left starbase an old friend<br>
    of mine came onboard: Doctor Dalen<br>
    Quaice. I requested quarters for<br>
    him. He was assigned here.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I was not aware of this passenger.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm sorry. I thought it was<br>
    standard procedure for you to be<br>
    notified once Captain Picard<br>
    approved passage.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is. Please proceed.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We were to meet for breakfast.<br>
    But I can't seem to find him...<br>
    or any of his things...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Computer, where is Doctor Dalen<br>
    Quaice?</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    There is no Doctor Dalen Quaice<br>
    aboard the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Lieutenant, Doctor Quaice is very<br>
    old, and rather frail. If he fell<br>
    somewhere... if his communicator<br>
    were damaged...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will order a search immediately.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Remember Me&quot; - REV. 8/21/90 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Worf pauses in the doorway, turns to look at Beverly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Even if Doctor Quaice had been<br>
    injured... why would his<br>
    belongings be missing?</p>
  <p> She answers him with an equally puzzled look. Worf<br>
    nods, EXITS, leaving Beverly alone in the empty room.</p>
  <p>11 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> PICARD is seated at his desk. Facing him are DATA,<br>
    Worf and Beverly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, I have several teams<br>
    conducting a deck-by-deck search.<br>
    It is not yet complete.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have scanned the entire ship,<br>
    Captain. Other than the<br>
    Enterprise's regular complement,<br>
    I can find no one else onboard.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (fearing the worst)<br>
    Your sensors wouldn't detect<br>
    him... if he were dead...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct, Doctor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    Could your friend have returned<br>
    to the starbase without telling<br>
    you? An emergency of some sort?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Remember Me&quot; - REV. 8/17/90 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There were a lot of people going<br>
    back and forth between the ship<br>
    and the starbase yesterday.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We can easily check the<br>
    transporter I.D. traces.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    By all means check the trace<br>
    log. But even if the results<br>
    are negative, contact Starbase<br>
    Command. We should leave nothing<br>
    to chance.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard nods, dismissed. Worf and Data EXIT. Beverly<br>
    starts to go.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor, one moment please.<br>
    (she turns back)<br>
    I'm sure you are aware of<br>
    procedures involving passengers.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Of course. I don't know why<br>
    Lieutenant Worf wasn't told about<br>
    Doctor Quaice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was not informed either.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (startled)<br>
    But I sent in a request weeks ago.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I never received it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm sure I had a confirmation.</p>
  <p> Picard studies her for a moment, then:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Computer, search passenger<br>
    requests. Doctor Dalen Quaice.<br>

    Point of embarkation: Starbase<br>
    One-Three-Three.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    No listing.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at Beverly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain, I sent in that request.<br>
    And it was approved.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then it must have been intercepted<br>
    before it reached me.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And someone else sent the<br>
    approval? Why?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor Quaice had been stationed<br>
    at the starbase for some time?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Six years.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It might be prudent to find out<br>
    if he'd acquired any enemies<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> He stands, follows Beverly out.</p>
  <p>12 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Wesley is at the helm. Riker nods as Beverly and<br>
    Picard emerge from the Ready Room.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    On course for Durenia Four, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very good, Number One. Mister<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Remember Me&quot; - REV. 8/14/90 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, Starbase One-Three-Three has<br>
    no record at all of a Doctor Dalen<br>
    Quaice.</p>
  <p> Picard exchanges a look with Beverly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I thought he was stationed there<br>
    for six years.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Not according to their computer.<br>
    I have also accessed Starfleet<br>
    records. There is no doctor<br>
    currently serving in Starfleet<br>
    named Quaice. In fact I cannot<br>
    find any service record<br>
    whatsoever. There are no birth<br>
    records with that name. I find<br>
    no --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Data, I interned with him on Delos<br>
    Four. I've known him for fifteen<br>
    years.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not doubt you, Doctor.<br>
    However I have tried one hundred<br>
    seventy-three phonetic variations<br>
    of the name, and --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    His name is Dalen Quaice.<br>
    Q-U-A-I-C-E. Whatever the records<br>
    say, they're wrong.</p>
  <p> Turbolift doors open. Worf appears.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, we have completed our<br>
    search. We cannot locate Doctor<br>
    Quaice.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're not alone.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Remember Me&quot; - REV. 8/17/90 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>12A ANGLE - TO INCLUDE WESLEY</p>
  <p> as he begins to realize a terrible possibility.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He was onboard. I met him in<br>
    Transporter Room Three myself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then it appears, for reasons<br>
    unknown, someone has gone to great<br>
    pains to erase all traces of this<br>
    man.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    Who was on transporter duty when<br>
    he came aboard?</p>
  <p> HARD CUT TO:</p>
  <p>13 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - O'BRIEN</p>
  <p> overseeing an N.D. CREWMAN working at an exposed panel.<br>
    PULL BACK to see Riker and Beverly with him.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (reacting)<br>
    Doctor Quaice? Was he part of<br>
    the regular crew rotation?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No. He's a friend of Doctor<br>
    Crusher's.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Remember Me&quot; - REV. 8/14/90 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    When did he arrive?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Sixteen hundred hours yesterday.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (startled)<br>
    That was my watch. I beamed this<br>
    man onboard?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes. I was here to greet him.<br>
    An elderly man? Not in the best<br>
    of health?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I'm sorry. I do remember you were<br>
    here for a short while. But you<br>
    were alone.</p>
  <p> Beverly stares at him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Was he invisible? Did I carry<br>
    on a conversation with thin air?</p>
  <p> O'Brien looks at her as if she's doing that right now.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    No, Doctor. As far as I can<br>
    recall, you came in, looked around<br>
    for a few moments... I asked you<br>
    if I could help you with<br>
    anything... All you said was<br>
    &quot;Thank you.&quot; I said &quot;My<br>
    pleasure,&quot; or something. That<br>
    was the end of it. There was no<br>
    one else here.</p>
  <p> Beverly is stunned. She exchanges a glance with an<br>
    equally astonished Riker.</p>

  <p>14 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Beverly and Riker on their way to the Bridge.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can't accept that Chief O'Brien<br>
    might be lying...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He believes what he says. And<br>
    there is no trace imprint for<br>
    Doctor Quaice.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Will, I didn't conjure up one of<br>
    my best friends from a test tube.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If the ship's records have been<br>
    tampered with, then the<br>
    transporter records could have<br>
    been changed as well.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And with everybody coming and<br>
    going yesterday, maybe O'Brien<br>
    just doesn't remember, or...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Or?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It might be a good idea to run<br>
    a diagnostic on him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    To make sure he hasn't been<br>
    tampered with?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What do you think?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's worth a try.</p>
  <p> The door opens at the Bridge.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Remember Me&quot; - REV. 8/23/90 - ACT TWO 15.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll check the replicator activity<br>
    logs -- eighteen hours is a long<br>
    time to go without food. Or<br>
    without someone seeing him.</p>
  <p> He EXITS.</p>
  <p>15 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> O'Brien is waiting when she arrives.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Chief, this examination should<br>
    only take a few minutes.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    But I feel fine.</p>
  <p> Only TWO NURSES are in sight. Beverly glances around,<br>
    puzzled.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Nurse)<br>
    Things are awfully quiet around<br>
    here. Is everybody really that<br>
    healthy?</p>
  <p> NURSE<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I'm not complaining.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We should still have a full staff<br>
    on duty.</p>
  <p> She turns back to O'Brien, not noticing the odd look<br>
    the Nurse gives her.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Sit down, over here...</p>

  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Doctor, it won't do any good to<br>
    check my eyesight. I didn't see<br>
    your friend.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    Computer, current whereabouts of<br>
    Doctors Hill and Selar.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    There is no Doctor Hill or Doctor<br>
    Selar aboard the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Beverly reacts.</p>
  <p>15A INT. CREW QUARTERS (FORMERLY SCENE 19)</p>
  <p> A middle-aged woman, CARA HILL, frowns at Beverly.</p>
  <p> CARA<br>
    I'm afraid I don't understand.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Your husband: Doctor Richard<br>
    Hill...</p>
  <p> CARA<br>
    With all due respect, you're<br>
    mistaken. I'm not married.</p>
  <p> Beverly stares at her.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Of course you are. Your husband<br>
    is my staff osteopath. You came<br>
    onboard together six months ago.</p>
  <p> CARA<br>
    I did report for duty six months<br>
    ago. But I was alone.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Remember Me&quot; - REV. 8/21/90 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>15A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> CARA (Cont'd)<br>
    I am not married. I've never<br>
    been married --<br>
    (a wry smile)<br>
    -- except perhaps to exobiology.</p>
  <p> This shakes Beverly.</p>
  <p>16 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard listens as Beverly explains.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Doctors Hill and Selar, and four<br>
    other members of my medical staff<br>
    have all vanished. All record<br>
    of their ever having been on the<br>
    Enterprise has been excised from<br>
    the computer's memory.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Did they come aboard with Doctor<br>
    Quaice?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (shakes her head)<br>
    No. They've been here for months.<br>
    But the two duty nurses don't<br>
    remember them. Their families<br>
    don't even remember them...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As O'Brien didn't remember Doctor<br>
    Quaice... ?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    I checked O'Brien thoroughly.<br>
    I found no physiological<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm in Engineering, sir. I think<br>
    there's something here you'd<br>
    better see. It might be<br>
    connected to Doctor Quaice's<br>
    disappearance.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    On my way.</p>
  <p> Wes exchanges a glance with Geordi.</p>

  <p>17 INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> As Beverly and Picard ENTER from the Ready Room, Riker<br>
    is in his chair, Data at Ops, Worf at Tactical. On the<br>
    move...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Number One, any progress?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (shakes his head)<br>
    No one's seen him. The replicator<br>
    in his quarters hasn't been used.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Check shield and hull integrity<br>
    for any sign of intruders...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yessir... but I have been closely<br>
    monitoring onboard sensors...<br>
    there has been no indication...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Then give me a Level One<br>
    diagnostic of all onboard sensors,<br>
    and run a manual sweep for any<br>
    anomalous airborne or<br>
    electromagnetic readings. I want<br>
    some answers.</p>
  <p> Picard and Beverly get on the turbolift.</p>
  <p>18 INT. ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Wesley and Geordi are at a computer. PULL BACK to find<br>
    Beverly and Picard behind them.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I've been experimenting with<br>
    Kosinski's warp field equations...<br>
    Trying to find a way to improve<br>
    engine efficiency.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I've read your reports.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Remember Me&quot; - REV. 8/21/90 - ACT TWO 19.</p>

    We did a test run while we were<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>

    Here's what the computer recorded.</p>
  <p>18A THE MONITOR - OKUDAGRAM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> It is a very distinctive, twisting shape... unique<br>
    enough to be recognized later.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    This is the static warp field<br>
    we created inside the warp drive.<br>
    The experiment was designed to<br>
    see if we could keep a bubble like<br>
    this intact.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    As you'll see in a moment, we<br>
    couldn't.</p>
  <p> On the screen the bubble expands, then contracts again<br>
    in the blink of an eye.</p>
  <p>18B RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There was a momentary flash of<br>
    light. It was all over the<br>
    spectrum.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I remember that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you suggesting this bubble<br>
    could have made Doctor Quaice<br>
    disappear?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    If he were caught in it...<br>
    yessir, it would seem to us like<br>
    he'd disappeared.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Remember Me&quot; - REV. 8/21/90 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>18B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Where would he go?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (sighs)<br>
    Who knows... he could even end<br>
    up outside our space-time<br>
    continuum...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Was Doctor Quaice in Engineering<br>
    during your experiment?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And this bubble never expanded<br>
    beyond Engineering?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Nossir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then how could it have trapped<br>
    Doctor Quaice or the others?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Other people are missing?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes, and they weren't anywhere<br>
    near Engineering either.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (shakes his head)<br>
    It doesn't make sense.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And I doubt warp bubbles could<br>
    alter computer records, or erase<br>
    memories.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Keep at it, Ensign, Mister La<br>
    Forge. It's the only working<br>
    theory we have for now.</p>
  <p> They acknowledge. Picard and Beverly EXIT...</p>

  <p>20 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Beverly ENTERS. Sickbay is totally deserted. She<br>
    stands frozen in the middle of the room, fighting off<br>
    a rising panic. She turns and hurries out.</p>
  <p>21 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Beverly ENTERS from the turbolift. Data is at Ops,<br>
    Picard and Riker looking over his shoulder. Worf is<br>
    at Tactical, a SUPERNUMERARY at Conn. There are no<br>
    other crew members present.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Has something else happened?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Sickbay is totally empty.<br>
    Apparently I no longer have any<br>
    staff.</p>
  <p> Picard, Data and Riker exchange glances.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And that surprises you, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (stares at him)<br>
    Surprises me? I'll say it<br>
    surprises me! There should be<br>
    at least four members of my staff<br>
    on duty at all times.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am afraid the ship's records<br>
    do not concur.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What are you talking about?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You do not have a staff.</p>
  <p> Again the panic begins to rise. Again Beverly fights<br>
    it off.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Excuse me, Doctor, but the entire<br>
    ship's complement is two hundred<br>
    thirty.</p>
  <p> Beverly fights her emotions, trying to digest this.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No. That's wrong! Whatever is<br>
    happening is affecting your<br>
    memories, too.</p>
  <p> Picard studies her...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor, may I see you in my Ready<br>

    Beverly, you're saying this ship<br>
    has lost nearly eight hundred of<br>
    its personnel... ?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I know how it must sound...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    None of the scans reveal any<br>
    anomalies... there is no sign of<br>
    an intruder... Wesley's experiment<br>
    clearly did not have the scope<br>
    to affect an entire starship...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The Enterprise is in serious<br>
    danger. You must believe me...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Remember Me&quot; - REV. 8/21/90 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>21A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have no choice but to believe<br>
    you. The safety of my crew is<br>
    at stake. But I want to be<br>
    sure...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That I haven't lost my mind?</p>
  <p> They look at each other in a very personal way.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I just examined myself... being<br>
    the only doctor on board, I had<br>
    to do it myself... there is no<br>
    sign of dysfunction... yes,<br>
    there's an elevation of adrenalin<br>
    which I think is understandable...</p>
  <p> A beat, she collects herself...</p>

  <p>24 BEVERLY'S POV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Something is forming in the air: a swirling vortex<br>
    of color and sound, spiraling larger, the sound a roar<br>
    of white noise, growing in intensity.</p>
  <p>25 BACK TO SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As the vortex grows, its wind begins to buffet her.<br>
    She finds herself being drawn by its force. She braces<br>
    herself against the wall. But the pull grows stronger<br>
    and stronger. Before she knows it she's caught up in a<br>
    whirling, blinding maelstrom. She grabs on to<br>
    something as she finds herself being inexorably pulled<br>
    into the vortex... Beverly screams.</p>
  <p> There's a blinding flash of light. The vortex is gone<br>
    in a wink. She falls to the floor, and lies there,<br>
    trying to catch her breath.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I've had a team in Sickbay for<br>
    two hours. We've run the mass<br>
    spectrometer on all<br>

    EM spectrum in case a wave guide<br>
    was somehow leaking radiation...<br>

    that Doctor Crusher saw...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I didn't just see it. I felt it.<br>

    Well, there's nothing there now.<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    The Wellington is the only<br>
