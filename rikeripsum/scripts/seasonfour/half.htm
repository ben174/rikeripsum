  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship moves into a synchronous orbit around a<br>
    planet... Kaelon Two.</p>
  <p> TROI (V.O.)<br>
    Counselor Deanna Troi, personal<br>
    log, stardate 44805.3...</p>
  <p>2 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> The turbolift doors open, and PICARD emerges rather<br>
    tentatively. Before taking a step, he looks both right<br>
    and left to ensure the coast is clear. Over This:</p>
  <p> TROI (V.O.)<br>
    (Continuing)<br>
    ... My mother is on board.</p>
  <p> Picard's taken about two steps before LWAXANA TROI<br>
    sweeps INTO FRAME from a doorway, with:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (ebullient)<br>
    Jean-Luc, you delicious man, you<br>
    were just thinking of me, weren't<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As a matter of fact, I...</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Well think no further, Dear<br>
    Heart... She's here!</p>
  <p> She winds her arm through his; will move with him along<br>
    the corridor, as:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, indeed.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Serious; always so serious.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Half A Life&quot; - REV. 2/27/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well at the moment, Lwaxana, I<br>
    am rather busy.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    And you're always busy with<br>
    something or other.<br>
    (sultry)<br>
    Never the right thing, though.<br>
    My daughter says we're picking<br>
    up someone interesting here?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. The leading scientist of<br>
    Kaelon Two and...</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Kaelon Two? Never heard of it.</p>
  <p> In desperation, Picard resorts to reason.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is a delicate situation,<br>
    Lwaxana... our first real contact<br>
    with a very reclusive people...<br>
    (trying to disengage)<br>
    And as it will be something of<br>
    an official greeting...</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Ah, diplomacy; I adore diplomacy.<br>
    Everyone dresses so well...</p>
  <p>3 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM ONE</p>
  <p> GEORDI waiting; O'BRIEN alongside his panel -- as<br>
    Picard and the still-entwined Lwaxana ENTER.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Energize, please, Mister O'Brien.</p>
  <p>4 INCLUDING TIMICIN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as he MATERIALIZES. A big, in-shape, inordinately<br>
    handsome man of sixty, he will stand stony-faced and<br>
    motionless. An imposing, and at first almost menacing,<br>
    figure, carrying a metallic clothing case. He is<br>
    humorless, colorless, distant... even wary.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Half A Life&quot; - REV. 2/26/91 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor Timicin? I am Jean-Luc<br>
    Picard, Captain of The Enterprise.<br>
    This is Lieutenant Commander La<br>
    Forge.</p>
  <p> Not a flicker of response from the grim visaged<br>
    Timicin. He glances around with anxious curiosity<br>
    like a man who just stepped off the boat at Ellis<br>
    Island.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (Continuing; beat)<br>
    We welcome you aboard, Sir.</p>
  <p>5 CLOSE - TIMICIN</p>
  <p> gathers himself slightly...</p>
  <p> TIMICIN<br>
    I beg your pardon, Captain...<br>
    this is my first time aboard a<br>
    Federation starship...</p>
  <p> Picard extends his hand and it takes Timicin a beat to<br>
    realize its significance...</p>
  <p> TIMICIN<br>
    Oh yes, they told me... shaking<br>
    of hands... a greeting...</p>
  <p> He shakes hands with Picard. Lwaxana CLEARS HER<br>
    THROAT pointedly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Half A Life&quot; - REV. 2/26/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah, I beg your pardon. Doctor<br>
    Timicin, may I present Lwaxana<br>
    Troi, of Betazed; also a guest<br>
    on board, and...</p>
  <p> Timicin awkwardly extends a hand... and she wraps her<br>
    arm around his arm moving ever so close to him, smiling<br>
    to the rather taken back fellow... Throughout:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (overriding)<br>
    ... And Daughter of The Fifth<br>
    House, Holder of the Sacred<br>
    Chalice of Rixx, Heir to the Holy<br>
    Rings of Betazed, and what are<br>
    you doing for dinner?</p>
  <p> TIMICIN<br>
    Well, I...<br>
    (eyes others)<br>
    ... I don't know, really.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have quite a bit of work<br>
    planned...</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    The man's never been on a<br>
    starship before, Jean-Luc...<br>
    somebody certainly ought to make<br>
    him comfortable before you get<br>
    started.</p>
  <p> She starts to lead him out...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It, uh... would seem Mrs. Troi<br>
    is our acting ambassador of good<br>
    will today.</p>
  <p> Exit line --</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (vamping him)<br>
    Just think of me as your<br>
    Entertainment Director.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Sweeping through space at warp speed.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log. Stardate 44805.7.<br>
    For generations, the people of<br>
    Kaelon Two have been working to<br>
    revitalize their dying sun. The<br>
    Federation has offered to assist<br>
    in testing what may be a solution<br>
    to this problem.</p>
  <p>8 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, RIKER, Timicin, DATA, TROI, BEVERLY and Geordi,<br>
    who holds a PADD. Timicin is still remote, cool and<br>
    official though not unfriendly...</p>
  <p> TIMICIN<br>
    (mid-conversation)<br>
    The basic theories for helium<br>
    fusion enhancement have been<br>
    discussed for over a century...<br>
    but there's been no method of<br>
    practical application until now...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The modifications that you have<br>
    made on the torpedo's guidance<br>
    systems are remarkable, doctor...</p>
  <p> Timicin doesn't smile... he's a man who doesn't easily<br>
    accept a compliment... especially from a stranger...</p>
  <p> TIMICIN<br>
    We'll see. They still have to<br>
    be proven in a practical test.</p>
  <p> As he gestures toward it, we see for the first time, an<br>
    image of a red giant star displayed on the MONITOR.</p>
  <p> TIMICIN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    At least, now it is possible.<br>
    I never dared hope to find such<br>
    a perfect match with our own sun.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Half A Life&quot; - REV. 2/27/91 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Our only regret is that it took<br>
    us three years to find a suitable<br>
    star after you first contacted<br>
    us.</p>
  <p> Timicin clears his throat... obviously struggling to<br>
    say something personal here... it doesn't come<br>
    easily...</p>
  <p> TIMICIN<br>
    This means a great deal to us,<br>
    to me... We are not used to<br>
    dealing with other worlds... to<br>
    asking for anything from others.<br>
    But your offer to help... it has<br>
    given us a possible means to our<br>
    survival.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's your work that's made this<br>
    possible, Doctor...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's right, we're only the<br>
    delivery service here...</p>
  <p> TIMICIN<br>
    (humble)<br>
    It has taken forty years of my<br>
    life to develop the programming<br>
    which will control your photon<br>
    torpedos... it has been my life...<br>
    my only wish has been to find a<br>
    way to revive our sun before I<br>
    die... thank you for giving me<br>
    this opportunity.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Half A Life&quot; - REV. 2/27/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>9 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> WORF at his post, contending with a superficially<br>
    inquisitive Lwaxana. Supernumeraries at other posts.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Mrs. Troi, I must protest your<br>
    unauthorized presence on the<br>
    Bridge.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (touching panel)<br>
    What does this little one do,<br>
    Mister Woof?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    Please, Madame! That is a<br>
    torpedo launch initiator. And<br>
    it, uh... it is Worf, Madame; not<br>
    Woof.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Oh.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Half A Life&quot; - REV. 2/26/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>10 ANGLE INCLUDING RIKER, TROI &amp; TIMICIN</p>
  <p> as they ENTER the Bridge.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (Continuing; to Troi)<br>
    Ah, there you are, dear; I've been<br>
    waiting for you.</p>
  <p> But Lwaxana walks right past her daughter to Timicin.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (Continuing)<br>
    And so nice to see you again so<br>
    soon.</p>
  <p> TIMICIN<br>
    (awkward smile)<br>
    Mrs. Troi.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes, Mother, what did you want?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (lost)<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You were waiting for me.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Of course I was, dear.<br>
    (to Timicin)<br>
    You really must let me do<br>
    something to relieve the tedium<br>
    of all this work, work, work...</p>
  <p> TIMICIN<br>
    As a matter of fact, we really<br>
    haven't...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Yes, dear. You go play now;<br>
    mother'll be fine.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Half A Life&quot; - REV. 2/27/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TIMICIN<br>
    I'm afraid I'm expected in<br>
    Engineering. I'm really terribly<br>
    sorry...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mrs. Troi? I'll have to ask you<br>
    to clear the Bridge now, please.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    I don't see why. There are lots<br>
    of other people here.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother? Please!</p>
  <p> Lwaxana will sweep out, unintimidated and unabashed,<br>
    as:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (to Timicin; brightly)<br>
    Don't you worry, we'll just have<br>
    to chat a bit later.</p>
  <p> Lwaxana EXITS. Timicin, looks after her curiously...</p>
  <p> TIMICIN<br>
    I'd never have thought her old<br>
    enough to be your mother. She's<br>
    so... vibrant.</p>
  <p>11 CLOSE - TROI</p>
  <p> Though Smiling politely in reply, she'll take a deep<br>
    breath and roll her eyes slightly as she turns away.</p>
  <p>12 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Still at warp speed.</p>
  <p>13 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> It's clearly been a long session; the pool table is<br>
    littered with PADDs and styluses. As Timicin, Geordi,<br>
    and Data examine a schematic of a photon torpedo<br>
    displayed on a monitor...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Half A Life&quot; - REV. 2/27/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (mid-discussion)<br>
    Is that why you reset the torpedo<br>
    sustainer engines to run on less<br>
    reactants?</p>
  <p> TIMICIN<br>
    Exactly... once we were able to<br>
    protect the triggering mechanism,<br>
    the flight engine power levels<br>
    could be minimized...<br>
    (moving to another<br>
    console)<br>
    ... now if we take a look at<br>
    another simulation, you'll see<br>
    that the temperature should<br>
    stabilize at two-twenty...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Half A Life&quot; - REV. 2/27/91 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>14 INCLUDING LWAXANA &amp; MR. HOMN</p>
  <p> He is interrupted by the opening of the doors and the<br>
    swooping ENTRANCE of Lwaxana -- who'll be followed by<br>
    her valet, MR. HOMN. He is carrying a picnic basket<br>
    loaded with (covered) picnic fare. Throughout:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Enough is enough; rescue is at<br>
    hand. Doctor Timicin, will you<br>
    clear all that mess from the<br>
    table, please?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That mess? Mrs. Troi...</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Now now now, you've been shut up<br>
    in here for hours; perfectly<br>
    ridiculous.<br>
    (to Timicin)<br>
    The table, please.</p>
  <p> Timicin is a little overwhelmed by the energy of this<br>
    woman... glances at Geordi... begins to tentatively<br>
    clear the table... as she continues...</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    If you boys don't eat something<br>
    you're going to be sick and who's<br>
    that going to help? I've made<br>
    some irresistible Mantickian pate.<br>
    Mister Homn will lay it out for<br>
    us.</p>
  <p> As Mister Homn acknowledges this with a bow, Lwaxana<br>
    explains to a bemused Timicin...</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Mister Homn is my valet. He<br>
    doesn't say much.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Half A Life&quot; - REV. 2/26/91 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (mutters)<br>
    How can he?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is true that the intellectual<br>
    efficiency of high order beings<br>
    does diminish proportionately when<br>
    the deprivation of rest or<br>
    nutritious fuel is...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (interrupts; gives up)<br>
    All right, all right; don't you<br>
    start.</p>
  <p> TIMICIN<br>
    Mrs. Troi...</p>
  <p> And his voice turns all heads to him... has he had<br>
    enough, is he fed up with her? Is this where he cuts<br>
    her off? A dramatic pause...</p>
  <p> TIMICIN<br>
    You are a wise woman. I'm sure<br>
    we could use a respite.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    These two call me Mrs. Troi. You<br>
    call me Lwaxana. Mister Homn?<br>
    Spread it.</p>
  <p> As Hohm spreads the tablecloth over the pool table,<br>
    Goerdi sighs and frowns... but for the first time since<br>
    we've met him, Timicin smiles.</p>
  <p>14A INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> As Lwaxana and Timicin ENTER...</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    So, knowing that my daughter's<br>
    starship would be passing fairly<br>
    close to Betazed, I maneuvered<br>
    a ride, and here I am.<br>
    (to Com)<br>
    Deck Eight.</p>
  <p> As the turbolift starts to move, Lwaxana reacts to...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Half A Life&quot; - REV. 2/26/91 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>14A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TIMICIN<br>
    I also have a grown daughter.<br>
    She has a little boy of her own.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Then you're married.</p>
  <p> TIMICIN<br>
    My wife died quite some time ago.</p>
  <p> Off her reaction...</p>
  <p>15 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Lwaxana and Timicin EXIT the turbolift. As the walk<br>
    down the corridor...</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    One thing I don't understand...<br>
    if your people have known for<br>
    generations that their sun is<br>
    dying... why not simply evacuate<br>
    the planet?</p>
  <p> TIMICIN<br>
    It is our home... it defines who<br>
    we are as a people. If Kaelon<br>
    ceases to exist... so do we...</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Then you definitely should fix<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> They come to a stop outside the door to Lwaxana's<br>
    Quarters.</p>
  <p> TIMICIN<br>
    With the Federation's help... I<br>
    hope we will.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>

    turns toward his own door -- has a second thought --<br>
    turns back and raises his hand preparatory to Ringing<br>
    the Chime -- but catches himself. His face reflects<br>
    that he is troubled beyond what he's allowed her to<br>

    No, they apply to him.</p>

    They expect Timicin to die, don't<br>

    die. Because he's sixty! What<br>
    is sixty; it's nothing!</p>
  <p> Lwaxana is for the moment too choked by her Tears to<br>

    went on long enough to become a<br>
    custom. A tradition. But it was<br>
    uncomfortable for the woman and<br>
    cruel to the animal. Then one<br>
    day one very formidable woman<br>
    finally said so; and refused to<br>
    wear another of those wigs. And<br>
