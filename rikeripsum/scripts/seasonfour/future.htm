    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Cruising at impulse power.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 44286.5.<br>
    The Enterprise is conducting a<br>
    security survey of the Onias<br>
    Sector near the Neutral Zone.<br>
    Despite being close to Romulan<br>
    territory, our mission has been<br>
    quiet and uneventful.</p>
  <p>2 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Begin close on the mouth of a trombone... then reveal<br>
    RIKER playing the horn to an appreciative audience made<br>
    up of GEORDI, TROI and several CREWMEMBERS. Riker<br>
    finishes his recital with a flourish... and a flat<br>
    note. As Riker grins good-naturedly, everyone laughs<br>
    and applauds.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Alright, Commander... you've got<br>
    until your next birthday to get<br>
    that right.</p>
  <p> As everyone laughs, Troi asides to Riker...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Many things improve with age...<br>
    maybe your trombone playing will<br>
    be one of them.</p>
  <p> Then WORF and BEVERLY approach from the bar area. Worf<br>
    carries a large birthday cake covered with lit candles.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's candle time, birthday boy.</p>
  <p> Worf places the cake on a table. Riker blows out the<br>
    candles to more applause. Then Troi approaches him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Future Imperfect&quot; - REV. 10/9/90 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What did you wish for, Will?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Music lessons.</p>
  <p> More laughter as we go to...</p>
  <p>3 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> DATA is at Ops and various SUPERNUMERARIES are at the<br>
    other positions as PICARD steps out of the Ready Room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, we'd better hurry or<br>
    we'll miss Commander Riker's<br>
    party.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Data stands, moves to join him...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I find it interesting how humans<br>
    place so much importance on<br>
    celebrating the day of their<br>
    birth... a day one cannot possibly<br>
    remember...</p>
  <p> Picard smiles... but as they begin to move toward the<br>
    Turbolift, a SUPERNUMERARY at an aft science station<br>
    stops them with...</p>
  <p> SUPERNUMERARY<br>
    Captain... I am detecting some<br>
    unusual fluctuations in subspace<br>
    frequencies.</p>
  <p> Picard frowns.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We had better take a look, Mister<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> The Supernumerary steps aside and Data takes his place<br>
    at the science station with Picard flanking him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Future Imperfect&quot; - REV. 10/9/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It appears we are being probed.</p>
  <p> Picard leans over him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Source?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The third planet of the Alpha<br>
    Onias system. Our reports list<br>
    it as presently uninhabited.<br>
    Perhaps the reports were<br>
    incorrect.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Or perhaps the rumors of a secret<br>
    Romulan base in this sector are<br>
    true.</p>
  <p> They exchange looks, then...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Picard to Commander Riker.</p>
  <p>4 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Riker and his guests. Reacting.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I apologize for interrupting your<br>
    celebration, but I need an Away<br>
    Team.</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As the great ship moves into a synchronous orbit over a<br>
    dull, gray planet. Alpha Onias Three.</p>
  <p>5A INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data is at Ops, flanked by Picard and Riker. Worf is<br>
    at tactical, Geordi at the engineering station. They<br>
    are studying an image of Alpha Onias Three on the<br>
    viewscreen before them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Future Imperfect&quot; - REV. 10/9/90 - TEASER 2A.</p>
  <p>5A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Although Alpha Onias Three is a<br>
    Class M planet, our survey teams<br>
    have listed it as barren and<br>
    inhospitable.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Any life signs?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, sir... but we have traced some<br>
    residual energy readings... to<br>
    a cavern two kilometers beneath<br>
    the surface.</p>
  <p> Riker and Picard exchange a look.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Romulans?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is possible. But I cannot be<br>
    certain.</p>
  <p> Riker digests this. Then...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I suppose you'll just have to go<br>
    down there and find out.</p>
  <p> As he heads toward the aft Turbolift...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf, Geordi... you're with me.</p>
  <p> Then Picard stops him with...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (half apologetic)<br>
    Number One... Happy Birthday.</p>
  <p> Riker acknowledges this with a smile. Then as he,<br>
    Worf, and Geordi step into the Turbolift...</p>
  <p>6 INT. CAVERN - ONIAS THREE (MATTE/OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Geordi, and Worf MATERIALIZE in the dark,<br>
    mist-filled cavern.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Future Imperfect&quot; - REV. 9/13/90 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> They light their palm beacons, sending dramatic beams<br>
    sweeping through the hazy air. Then Geordi scans with<br>
    his tricorder.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm detecting high levels of<br>
    volcanic gases... sulphur dioxide,<br>
    methane, hydrogen sulphide...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Toxic?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We're okay for now... But I<br>
    wouldn't want to spend my vacation<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What about energy readings?</p>
  <p> Worf frowns at his own tricorder.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Magnetic clutter is increasing.<br>
    I cannot make an accurate<br>
    determination.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Same here. I'm getting some very<br>
    confused readings...</p>

  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    (breaking up, through<br>
    static)<br>
    We're having trouble reading you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And we are having similar<br>
    difficulties reading you, Number<br>
    One. I am advising you...</p>
  <p>9 INT. CAVERN</p>
  <p> Riker and his Team listen to the garbled transmission.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    ... and your team to transport<br>
    up... At once...</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts to his tricorder, turns, scans...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Good advice, Commander. We've<br>
    got a sudden build-up of gases<br>
    here... especially methane.</p>
  <p> He indicates a roiling, swirling cloud of lethal<br>
    looking vapor which now blocks the far end of the<br>
    cavern. Riker reacts, keys his insignia...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Transporter Room, take us up.</p>
  <p>10 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER CHIEF HUBBLE struggles with the<br>
    Transporter Scan.</p>
  <p> HUBBLE<br>
    I can't get a solid lock on you,<br>
    sir. Too much interference.</p>
  <p>11 INT. CAVERN - ON AWAY TEAM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Gas boils up around them. The Away Team is coughing.<br>
    Geordi drops to his knees. Worf moves to assist him.<br>
    The BEAM OUT BEGINS, STOPS, then TRIES TO START again.</p>

  <p> Geordi and Worf are both on the floor. Motionless.<br>
    Riker is the last to fall.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>16 INT. RIKER'S SICKBAY ROOM</p>
  <p> And a bright light on the Sickbay ceiling... Camera<br>
    tilts down to reveal an N.D.NURSE as she ENTERS and<br>
    reacts to an unseen patient.</p>
  <p> N.D. NURSE<br>
    Doctor Crusher... He's awake.</p>
  <p> Beverly ENTERS -- An older Beverly whose hair is now<br>
    styled differently and streaked with gray. We do not<br>
    see Riker's face as she leans over him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Beverly?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (pleased smile)<br>
    You remember me... that's good.<br>
    What else can you remember,<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    (confused)<br>

  <p> And that's when we get a good look at Sickbay -- a<br>
    Sickbay which is subtly different. Riker reacts as<br>

  <p> Beverly stands at the food slot.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to food slot)<br>
    Water. Three Celsius.</p>
  <p> The water MATERIALIZES. As she brings this to<br>
    Riker...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How do you feel?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Confused.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (small smile)<br>
    Understandable... considering<br>
    what's happened.</p>
  <p> Riker stands, starts to pace.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What has happened... to this<br>
    Sickbay... to you... to me?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Sit down, Captain.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I am not &quot;Captain.&quot; I'm<br>
    Commander... Commander Will<br>
    Riker. What's going on here?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Alpha Onias Three. The Enterprise<br>
    had been probed... Geordi, Worf,<br>
    and I transported down to track<br>
    the source.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But all you found was toxic gas.<br>
    They barely got the three of you<br>
    out in time.<br>
    (a careful beat)<br>
    Will... that happened sixteen<br>
    years ago.</p>
  <p> As much as he's seen and experienced in all his years<br>
    in Starfleet, Riker is still rocked to his core.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's not possible!</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    With an Altarian virus, anything<br>
    is possible. In fact, we expected<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> Riker shows some steel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Could you be more specific?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That day on Onias Three you were<br>
    infected with a strain of Altarian<br>
    encephalitis. A retrovirus that<br>
    incorporates its DNA directly into<br>
    the cells of its host. It can<br>
    lie dormant for years, then<br>
    suddenly become active, as it did<br>
    in your case ten days ago.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    You've been in a coma,<br>
    delirious... Your fever finally<br>
    broke this morning...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But what happened to my memory?</p>
  <p> Beverly crosses to a wall monitor and taps it. A<br>
    graphic display of living brain cells comes up.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    This is a scan of your brain<br>
    tissue. When the encephalitis<br>
    became active... it caused<br>
    widespread synapse degradation,<br>
    interrupting the consolidation<br>
    of memory...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Future Imperfect&quot; - REV. 9/19/90 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (get to the point)<br>
    Doctor.</p>
  <p> Beverly pauses. In no hurry to give him the bad news.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Will... this virus invariably<br>
    destroys all memory back to the<br>
    moment of the original infection.<br>
    In your case, all the way back<br>
    to Alpha Onias Three.</p>
  <p> Riker is reeling. But he fights back... denying...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can't believe this... it's a<br>
    dream... or...</p>
  <p> Beverly crosses to Riker, takes his hand in hers.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Feel my hand... flesh and bone.<br>
    This is not a dream... and you<br>
    are Captain William T. Riker...<br>
    in command of the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Riker relaxes slightly. He can't negate the reality of<br>
    all this... at least not yet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (almost afraid to ask)<br>
    The Enterprise... for how long?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Nine years.</p>
  <p> Riker absorbs this latest blow. Then regains his<br>
    balance, and comes right back at Beverly...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If I've lost my memory... how do<br>
    I find it again?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Memory is formed out of<br>
    association. Smells, sounds, and<br>
    images in the present could<br>
    possibly trigger them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Future Imperfect&quot; - REV. 9/19/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (seeing it)<br>
    Like the way a song can remind<br>
    you of... old friends...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Exactly. In associational<br>
    therapy, we expose the patient<br>
    to familiar surroundings. This<br>
    could stimulate the brain's neural<br>
    synapses into regenerating.</p>
  <p> Riker heads to the door, determined.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then let's get started. There's<br>
    nothing more familiar to me than<br>
    the Enterprise. If anything's<br>
    going to bring back...</p>
  <p> But Beverly stops him with...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

  <p>18 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> As Riker walks down the corridor with Beverly, he<br>
    reacts to the changes sixteen years have wrought upon<br>
    the Enterprise and her crew. (GENERAL NOTE: Throughout<br>
    the ship, the changes are extremely subtle.)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What about Geordi and Worf? Were<br>
    they infected, too?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Thankfully, no. Geordi appears<br>
    to have been immune and the virus<br>
    has no effect on Klingons.</p>
  <p> A striking looking KLINGON WOMAN in a Starfleet uniform<br>
    walks by. As she strides off, Riker stares after her.</p>

    Speaking of Klingons...</p>

  <p> As the Turbolift stops, Riker explains to Beverly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    My life is on the Bridge, always<br>
    has been. If anything's going<br>
    to jog my memory...<br>

    I said, Main Bridge.</p>
  <p> The Turbolift suddenly begins moving once more. Riker<br>

  <p> Before Riker can respond to this, the doors open.</p>
  <p>20 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker steps out from the aft Turbolift, followed by<br>
    Beverly. The first crewman they encounter is an older<br>
    GEORDI standing at the aft engineering station... his<br>
    back to them. Riker is delighted...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Geordi...</p>
  <p> Geordi turns around, bringing still another shock with<br>
    him. His VISOR is gone, replaced by normal eyes.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Good to see you up and about<br>
    again, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker can't help staring...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Geordi... your eyes... what<br>
    happened to your VISOR... ?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    My VISOR? I...<br>
    (catches self)<br>
    Sorry, sir. Doctor Crusher warned<br>
    us... you might not remember.<br>

    I don't need my VISOR, Captain...<br>
    not since I got these cloned<br>
    implants...</p>
  <p> Geordi's voice trails off. Riker just nods, then moves<br>
    on, past the SUPERNUMERARY at tactical and down the<br>
    ramp... to see WORF at Ops. The Klingon turns to<br>
    display a livid battle scar on his cheek.</p>

  <p> A FERENGI ENSIGN is at the Conn. He also turns, smiles<br>
    a toothy grin at Riker. Riker manages a stunned nod to<br>
    both aliens, then enters the Command Area. DATA (the<br>
    only crew member who is unchanged) sits in the center<br>
    chair. He rises at Riker's approach.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Welcome back, Captain. We did<br>

    No, Data. Not a single day of<br>

    you have recovered.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    I'm not exactly sure you can call<br>

  <p> Troi and Picard realize their worst fears have been<br>

    To lose sixteen years...</p>
  <p> He turns to Riker, who sits in the Captain's chair.<br>
    Not comfortably. Troi stands near by.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    And it couldn't have happened at<br>
    a worse time. A few more days<br>
    of relatively simple negotiations,<br>
    and the treaty will be signed.</p>
  <p> An impatient Riker cuts in...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What negotiations? What treaty?</p>
  <p> Picard sits at the table, near Riker.</p>

  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sorry. I'll start at the<br>
    beginning, which was four years<br>
    ago. A Romulan battle cruiser<br>
    strayed into Federation space.<br>
    Its warp coils had collapsed, and<br>
    its life support was failing.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You saved them, Will. You and<br>
    the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This impressed the Romulans, to<br>
    say the least. After years of<br>
    distrust and conflict, they<br>
    started to talk. You have been<br>
    our key spokesman...</p>
  <p> Then to Riker's inquiring look.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... in securing an alliance with<br>
    the Romulans.</p>
  <p> Riker is stunned... but manages to keep his balance.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How far have these negotiations<br>
    progressed?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The preliminaries are over. All<br>
    we need do now is escort the<br>
    Romulan Ambassador to the final<br>
    session.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Where you will help complete the<br>
    negotiations and sign the treaty.</p>
  <p> Riker digests all of this. Comes to a conclusion.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, excuse me, sir, I mean<br>
    Admiral... I am in no condition<br>
    to negotiate with the Romulans<br>
    or anyone else.</p>

  <p>24 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Will... you are of sound mind and<br>
    body. If you were properly<br>
    briefed, you could still fulfill<br>
    your duties.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    With a sixteen year gap in my<br>
    head?</p>
  <p> Riker rises to his feet, walks to the window. Picard<br>
    exchanges a look with Troi, then crosses to Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know this has all been... a<br>
    terrible shock... but we do need<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (with difficulty)<br>
    Sir, I'm not sure I'm... fit to<br>
    resume command...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (gently)<br>
    I appreciate your candor and your<br>
    concern. But despite your...<br>
    affliction... there is still no<br>
    one better equipped to deal with<br>
    these Romulans than you.</p>
  <p> A beat. And Riker reluctantly gives in.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    When do we leave?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (relieved)<br>
    As soon as the Ambassador<br>
    transports over from the Decius.<br>
    I'll make the arrangements.<br>
    (intently)<br>
    We will get through this. As we<br>
    have many times before.</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS. Then Riker turns to the window. As he<br>

    surveys a room adorned with mementoes gathered in those<br>
    sixteen missing years... decorations for bravery...<br>
    alien art works... furniture he has never seen before.<br>
    He reacts to all of this, exchanges a look with Troi...</p>
  <p> Then they hear a trombone playing off key in the next<br>
    room. Riker goes into...</p>
  <p>26 INT. JEAN-LUC'S ROOM</p>
  <p> Riker walks in and discovers a ten year old boy playing<br>
    the trombone. Then the boy turns. And smiles.</p>

  <p> Troi and a stunned Riker watch as Jean-Luc reaches<br>
    under seat cushions, checks behind chairs, searching<br>
    for something. The eager boy is in mid-story...</p>
  <p> JEAN-LUC<br>
    ... and then Mister Greenburg asked<br>
    me about the Fornax Disaster, and<br>
    I knew the Enterprise had saved<br>
    all the colonists. But I didn't<br>
    know...<br>
    (off the track)<br>
    Here it is!</p>
  <p> He pulls a school PADD out from under a pile of clutter<br>
    on a table, takes it to Riker.</p>
  <p> JEAN-LUC<br>
    (back on track)<br>
    ... But I didn't know the exact<br>
    Stardate their sun went nova.<br>
    If you tell me, I'll write it<br>
    down. That way I won't forget.</p>
  <p> Riker stares at the PADD, then at the son he doesn't<br>
    know. And the boy realizes it. His energy and<br>
    excitement vanish, to be replaced by a quiet grief.</p>
  <p> JEAN-LUC<br>
    You don't remember me... do you?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (what else can he say?)<br>
    I'm... sorry.</p>
  <p> There's an awkward silence, which Troi breaks.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I need to talk to your father,<br>
    Jean-Luc. Could you leave us<br>
    alone... for just a moment?</p>
  <p> And as Jean-Luc returns to his room, Riker faces Troi:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why didn't you warn me?</p>

    It had an impact alright...<br>

    She died two years ago... a<br>
    shuttle accident. I'm sorry,<br>

  <p> Riker doesn't know how to react to this. At this point<br>
    his wife is nothing more than a name to him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I have absolutely no recollection<br>
    of her... what was she like?</p>

    'Min' was very beautiful, of<br>

    She took over after I left.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts to that.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can't imagine you leaving the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Admiral Picard offered me a<br>

    Pretty bad, huh?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've heard better.</p>

    him how to hold it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Okay. Left hand like this. Right<br>
    hand... like this.</p>
  <p> Riker runs through the scales. Jean-Luc smiles. Riker<br>
    segues into a melody... the same melody he played in<br>
    the opening. He finishes with a flourish -- and a flat<br>

    desk screen.</p>
  <p> JEAN-LUC<br>
    Is that what you wanted?</p>
  <p> Riker frowns at the desk screen, his instincts<br>
    screaming that something is very wrong here. And<br>
    then...</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Picard to Captain Riker. The<br>
    Romulan Ambassador is ready to<br>
    transport over from the Decius.</p>
  <p> Riker keys his insignia.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    On my way.<br>
    (to the boy)<br>
    I've got to go, Jean-Luc.</p>

  <p> Riker stops at the door as...</p>
  <p> JEAN-LUC<br>
    Everything's going to be fine.</p>
  <p> Riker isn't so certain. But he manages a smile before<br>
    he leaves.</p>
  <p>29B INT. CORRIDOR TO TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Riker, Troi, Picard walking.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (gently)<br>
    Troi tells me you met Jean-Luc.<br>
    How is my namesake holding up to<br>
    all this?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Better than I am.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We did our best to prepare him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (sighs)<br>
    I'm trying to catch up with all<br>
    this. I've still got a long way<br>
    to go. A long way.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Just follow my lead with the<br>
    Ambassador. You'll do fine.</p>

  <p> A uniformed Romulan MATERIALIZES. It's TOMALAK, the<br>
    arrogant Commander who confronted the Enterprise at<br>
    Galorndon Core and Nelvana Three... Fourteen years ago.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    Admiral Picard, Captain Riker...<br>
    it's good to see you again.</p>
  <p> A stunned Riker responds with a polite nod as Picard<br>
    approaches the Romulan.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ambassador Tomalak... Welcome<br>
    aboard the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Tomalak steps off the Transporter pad, smiles<br>
    ingratiatingly at Picard.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    Thank you, Admiral. It is an<br>
    honor to be the first Romulan to<br>
    freely walk about a Federation<br>
    Starship.</p>
  <p> As Picard escorts Tomalak out, Riker hangs back a<br>
    moment with Troi.</p>

  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (what is this?)<br>
    Ambassador... Tomalak? At Nelvana<br>
    Three, he threatened to take the<br>
    hull of the Enterprise home as<br>
    a war trophy!</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That was a long time ago. Many<br>
    things have changed. Including<br>
    Tomalak.</p>
  <p> And off Riker's doubting look...</p>
  <p>32 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, and Troi walk with Tomalak. The Romulan<br>
    is cheerful and charming. Riker is tense and watchful.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    As soon as we arrive at your<br>
    Outpost Twenty-Three, the final<br>
    negotiations should go quickly.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts to this, looks to Picard and Troi... But<br>
    they seem oblivious to his concern.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I agree, Ambassador. All of the<br>
    difficult issues have been<br>
    resolved.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    (with a cordial smile)<br>
    After much debate. Your Captain<br>
    Riker is the kind of negotiator<br>
    even the Ferengi should avoid.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But we have come to an agreement<br>
    both sides can live with. Thanks<br>
    largely to Captain Riker.</p>
  <p> They pause by the Turbolift. Tomalak smiles at Riker.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    And we are grateful, Captain.<br>
    The new alliance will greatly<br>
    benefit my people.</p>
  <p> Riker chooses his words carefully.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Future Imperfect&quot; - REV. 9/25/90 - ACT TWO 26.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    As I hope it will benefit mine.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    (smoothly)<br>
    It will, Captain. It will.</p>
  <p> Riker is not sure about this at all. The Turbolift<br>
    door opens and they all enter.</p>
  <p>32A INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Riker, Troi, Picard, and Tomalak ENTER.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Main Bridge.</p>
  <p> The Turbolift starts to move. Tomalak eyes Riker and<br>
    seems to pick up on the other man's uneasiness.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    The virus you contracted, Captain.<br>
    You have fully recovered?</p>
  <p> The question throws Riker for just a moment. Which<br>
    is long enough for Picard to step in...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (smoothly)<br>
    I assure you Captain Riker is<br>
    quite well. He's looking forward<br>
    to attending the final<br>
    negotiations... as planned.</p>
  <p> Tomalak smiles.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    Excellent.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    The signing of this treaty will<br>
    be an historic occasion. You,<br>
    of all people, deserve to be<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> Riker is still not convinced. His response is cool<br>
    but polite.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you... Ambassador.</p>
  <p> The door opens, and they EXIT.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Future Imperfect&quot; - REV. 9/25/90 - ACT TWO 26A.</p>
  <p>33 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Troi, and the Romulan ENTER. Tomalak<br>
    takes a long look about the Bridge, impressed.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    So... this is the Bridge of the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> He approaches tactical and peers over the startled<br>
    supernumerary's shoulder.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    And this, I assume, is your<br>
    Tactical position. Impressive.</p>
  <p> Riker has had enough. He turns to Picard and Troi.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Admiral, Deanna... I need a moment<br>
    with you...<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    ... Commander Data, if you will,<br>
    please accompany the Ambassador<br>
    on his... tour.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Certainly, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Tomalak)<br>
    Excuse us, Ambassador.</p>
  <p> Tomalak nods, then continues his perusal of tactical as<br>
    Data moves up beside him. As Riker, Picard, and Troi<br>
    head for the Ready Room...</p>

  <p> A tense Riker faces the others.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you telling me you trust<br>
    Tomalak?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I trust the process we have built<br>
    with the Romulans over the past<br>
    four years. They have nothing<br>
    to gain by betrayal.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you sure? You yourself have<br>
    said it's always like a chess game<br>
    with the Romulans. Move and<br>
    counter-move, guile and deceit<br>
    --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (gently cutting in)<br>
    I sense no such dishonesty in<br>
    Tomalak. He is sincere in his<br>
    desire for peace. He wants this<br>
    alliance. There is no cause for<br>
    concern.</p>
  <p> Riker is not convinced.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No cause for concern? We're<br>
    talking about revealing the<br>
    location of Outpost Twenty-Three,<br>
    the key to all our Neutral Zone<br>
    defenses.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Pardon my bluntness, Captain, but<br>
    your information is out of date.<br>
    The strategic importance of<br>
    Outpost Twenty-Three is minimal.<br>
    And has been for years.</p>

  <p>35 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Riker walks in to find Jean-Luc sitting on a diagnostic<br>
    bed while Beverly tends to his arm. The boy wears a<br>
    Parrises Squares outfit. The N.D. Nurse stands by.</p>
  <p> JEAN-LUC<br>
    Dad!</p>
  <p> Riker is as concerned as any father would be.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you alright?</p>
  <p> JEAN-LUC<br>
    I'm fine.</p>
  <p> Then the boy winces as Beverly runs an instrument over<br>
    his wrist. Riker reacts...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's broken... But we'll have<br>
    it all taken care of in a minute.</p>
  <p> She finishes treating Jean-Luc's arm. He tentatively<br>
    moves his arm, grins with relief.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Now just take it easy on that arm<br>
    for a while.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Jean-Luc)<br>
    How did you do this?</p>
  <p> JEAN-LUC<br>

  <p> Riker allows Beverly to lead him aside.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Will... how old were you when you<br>
    started playing Parrises Squares?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (thinks, sighs)<br>
    Alright... I was probably younger<br>
    than he is...</p>

    him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's just that... For all<br>
    practical purposes, this is my<br>
    first day as a father... my son<br>
    almost kills himself...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He didn't almost kill himself...<br>
    he just broke a wrist... like a<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Difficult for you? What about<br>
    Jean-Luc? Can you imagine how<br>
    he must feel?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You've lost sixteen years, but<br>
    Jean-Luc has lost a lot more...<br>
    his mother... and now his father.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts to that... then turns from Beverly and<br>
    approaches Jean-Luc. The Nurse smiles at Riker...</p>
  <p> NURSE<br>
    Good as new, Captain. You can<br>
    take him home.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thanks.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>

    It's fine.<br>

    Dad, I'm really sorry... I know<br>
    you've got more important<br>
    things...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Nothing as important as this, son.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    I know this must be... very hard<br>

  <p> JEAN-LUC<br>
    It's okay, Dad.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (takes a deep breath)<br>
    Okay's not good enough.</p>
  <p> Riker pauses, looking for the words.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    When I was your age... my own<br>
    father... he wasn't there for<br>
    me. And I needed him. I<br>
    really... needed him.<br>
    (softly)<br>
    I always wondered what kind of<br>
    father I'd be. I never felt quite<br>
    ready. Maybe the idea even scared<br>

  <p> JEAN-LUC<br>
    Scared... you?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yeah.<br>
    (beat, smiles)<br>
    But I must have gotten over it,<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    It wasn't. There was the computer<br>

  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    Unavoidable. Our scanners have<br>

    woman you were extremely attracted<br>
    to...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Your mistake, Tomalak. Minuet<br>
    was nothing more than a computer<br>
    generated fantasy I once<br>
    experienced on another Holodeck.</p>
  <p> Tomalak is not buying this.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    Impossible. In your mind, that<br>

    If Outpost Twenty-three is what<br>
    you're after... Why didn't you<br>
    just use your neural scanners to<br>
    probe my mind?</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    Our scanners are calibrated for<br>
    Romulan brain patterns. When it<br>
    comes to human brains, they are<br>
    less efficient. There were gaps<br>
    in the information we gathered<br>

    Please say hello to your son.</p>
  <p> And Riker reacts to... a ragged, dirty little boy<br>
    huddled in a corner of the cell. It is Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Jean-Luc?</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    That is not his name, of course.<br>
    Nor have you ever really met him.<br>
    We merely... used his image to<br>
    augment your program.</p>
  <p> Riker carefully approaches the boy... who flinches away<br>
    and scuttles to another corner of the cell. Riker<br>
    reacts, then glares at Tomalak.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What have you done to him?</p>
  <p> Tomalak ignores the question.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    While I am gone, please give<br>
    careful thought to your situation.</p>

    of here, you've got to trust me...</p>

    a dark entryway. Riker moves to help him.</p>

  <p> Then Ethan lights their way with the lantern as Riker<br>
    follows him through the entryway into...</p>
  <p>63AA INT. CRAWLSPACE - ANOTHER SECTION</p>
  <p> Riker and Ethan move through the narrow crawlspace.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    When you escaped last time...<br>
    how'd you manage it?</p>
  <p> ETHAN<br>
    I acted like I was sick... when<br>
    the Romulans took me to the<br>
    infirmary, I ran away.</p>
  <p> Ethan pauses, faces Riker.</p>
  <p> ETHAN<br>
    I was lucky... I found this place<br>
    the same day.</p>
  <p> Riker nods appreciateively as they move on to...</p>
  <p>63A INT. SECRET ROOM</p>
  <p> ... Where Ethan activates a light cell, bathing the room<br>
    in a soft glow.</p>
  <p> ETHAN<br>
    ... The Romulans forgot all about<br>
    this storeroom when they rebuilt<br>
    the tunnels.</p>
  <p> The boy crosses to a pile of crates stacked in a corner<br>
    of the cluttered room... starts searching through them.</p>
  <p> ETHAN<br>
    After I got away last time...</p>
  <p> Ethan produces a folded piece of synthetic cloth.</p>
  <p> ETHAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... I mapped out all their tunnels.</p>
  <p> He lays the cloth out across a crate... to reveal a<br>
    rough map of the base. As Ethan points things out...</p>

    Supply depot, communications,<br>
    living quarters... and the shuttle<br>
    bay.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (instantly intrigued)<br>
    How many guards at the shuttle<br>
    bay?</p>
  <p> ETHAN<br>
    Only two or three.</p>
  <p> Riker thinks about it, shakes his head.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Stealing a shuttle would get us<br>
    nowhere... too easy for the<br>
    Romulans to track one of their<br>
    own ships.<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Future Imperfect&quot; - REV. 9/18/90 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>63A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER (Cont'd)<br>
    (points at map)<br>
    But we could break into<br>
    communications. Send a message<br>
    to the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Ethan looks doubtful. Shakes his head.</p>
  <p> ETHAN<br>
    We can't do that... The<br>
    transmitter is on a<br>
    voice-activated security system!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you know whose voice it<br>
    accepts?</p>
  <p> ETHAN<br>
    Only Ambassador Tomalak.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    Who?</p>
  <p> ETHAN<br>
    Tomalak.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ambassador Tomalak.</p>
  <p> Ethan looks up at him, suddenly aware of the man's<br>
    stunned reaction. Riker just stares at him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Tomalak is a Romulan Captain.<br>
    The only time he was called<br>
    &quot;Ambassador&quot; was in their Holodeck<br>
    fantasy. How would you know about<br>
    that?</p>
  <p> ETHAN<br>
    You... you told me about it.</p>
  <p> Riker shakes his head, no I didn't.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Who are you? What's your part<br>
    in all this?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Future Imperfect&quot; - REV. 9/18/90 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>63A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> They react to a sudden, off screen explosion and the<br>
    sounds of the approaching Romulans. Ethan turns to<br>
    Riker, shouts a warning...</p>
  <p> ETHAN<br>
    They've found us!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (calm)<br>
    But you said their sensors didn't<br>
    work in this tunnel.</p>
  <p> ETHAN<br>
    They must have fixed them. We've<br>
    got to go!</p>
  <p> He grabs at Riker, but he won't budge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And where will we go, Ethan?</p>
  <p> ETHAN<br>
    To the shuttle bay! There's still<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No... I've had enough.</p>
  <p> And they both react as...</p>
  <p>63B TOMALAK AND TWO GUARDS</p>
  <p> Step into the room.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    Commander... surrender your<br>
    weapon...</p>
  <p> And as the three Romulans raise their weapons... Riker<br>
    drops his phaser and casually lifts his arms, palms<br>
    up.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No more games. No more fantasies.<br>
    I'm not going to play anymore.</p>
  <p> Then Riker makes eye contact with Ethan. A last, sad<br>
    moment between them. And the boy relaxes... he knows<br>
    the game has finally and truly ended. Then...</p>

  <p> Suddenly SHIMMER away.</p>
  <p>67 THE ENTIRE ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Also disappears... to reveal the immense cavern where<br>
    our story began. Riker and Ethan are left alone in the<br>
    huge room. Riker stares at the boy. Shocked.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It was never the Romulans... it<br>
    was you all along, wasn't it?</p>
  <p> Ethan hangs his head. Then we go to...</p>
  <p>68 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - THE REAL ENTERPRISE</p>
  <p> Picard and Data are at an aft station, huddled over a<br>
    monitor.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is no question about it,<br>
    sir. It is his signal.</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges this with a nod. Then Troi, Worf,<br>
    and Geordi watch, concerned, as...</p>

    Picard to Riker... can you read<br>
    me?</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    (after a beat)<br>
    Riker to Picard. I'm here.</p>
  <p> The general relief at the sound of Riker's voice is<br>
    obvious.</p>

  <p> Riker and Ethan.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Are you all right?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Future Imperfect&quot; - REV. 9/18/90 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>69 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes... What about Worf and<br>
    Geordi?</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    We beamed them up an hour ago...<br>
    They're fine.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    But we lost you in mid-transport.<br>
    Where have you been? What is<br>
    going on down there?</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    I'm not sure, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard raises an eyebrow as we go back to...</p>
  <p>69B INT. ALIEN CHAMBER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker and Ethan.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But I think I'm about to find<br>
    out... stand by.</p>
  <p> Riker keys his insignia and faces the boy, who is sad<br>
    but calm.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What should I call you? Ethan...<br>
    Jean-Luc?</p>
  <p> ETHAN<br>
    (sad)<br>
    It doesn't matter.</p>
  <p> Riker crosses to the wall, listens to a faint humming<br>
    beyond.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This room... it's more than just<br>
    a Holodeck, isn't it?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Future Imperfect&quot; - REV. 9/18/90 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>69B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ETHAN<br>
    (almost proud)<br>
    Much more. The neural scanners<br>
    read my mind... give me anything<br>
    I want. Just like they tried<br>
    to give you everything you<br>
    wanted.</p>
  <p> Riker is furious... and for good reason.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What I wanted? You probed the<br>
    Enterprise... lured us here...<br>
    so you could play games with me.<br>
    I didn't want any of that... you<br>
    did. Why?</p>
  <p> The boy looks older, sadder, less the child.</p>
  <p> ETHAN<br>
    My world was invaded... my<br>
    people... killed. My mother<br>
    brought me here... so our enemies<br>
    would never find me.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts... tone changing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But they found her, didn't they?</p>
  <p> Ethan nods -- the memory, distant as it is, still<br>
    painful.</p>
  <p> ETHAN<br>
    She knew they would never stop<br>
    looking for her... So she made<br>
    sure I would be safe...</p>
  <p> He touches his forehead, then gestures at the<br>
    surrounding walls as...</p>

    She left the scanners to protect<br>
    me... and to give me everything<br>
    I wanted.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Future Imperfect&quot; - REV. 9/18/90 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>69C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker reacts to the youngster's pain. Abandoned by his<br>
    own father, he knows what it's like to be a lonely<br>
    little boy.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Everything... then why kidnap me?</p>
  <p> ETHAN<br>
    (after a pause)<br>
    I wanted you to stay. It's been<br>
    so long... I just wanted<br>
    somebody... real. I... thought<br>
    you would be happy... I'm<br>
    sorry...</p>
  <p> Riker is gentle... but insistent.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I have to return to my ship.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Come with me. You don't have<br>
    to stay here anymore... you don't<br>
