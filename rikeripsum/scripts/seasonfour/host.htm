  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> travelling through space.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (V.O.)<br>
    Doctor Beverly Crusher, Personal<br>
    Log, Stardate 44821.3. Began<br>
    an analysis today of the<br>
    respiratory problems being<br>
    experienced by the populations on<br>
    the two moons of Peliar Zel.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Finally got an actual letter from<br>
    Wesley... topped the class in<br>
    exo-biology, but he's still<br>
    struggling in Ancient<br>
    Philosophies.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And... there's... a new man in<br>
    my life.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>2 CLOSE ON BEVERLY AND ODAN KISSING</p>
  <p> A passionate kiss of some duration which, when they<br>
    break, leaves them both flushed and breathing deeply.<br>
    They stare into one another's eyes for a brief instant,<br>
    and then start as they hear a door opening.</p>
  <p>3 INT. TURBOLIFT - WIDER SHOT</p>
  <p> We now realize they are in a turbolift, the doors of<br>
    which have opened to admit DATA, who greets them with<br>
    delighted surprise. If he notices their flushed and<br>
    rumpled condition, he gives no indication.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ambassador Odan... Doctor<br>
    Crusher... I was just on my way<br>
    to see you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/6/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Beverly tries to compose herself, resisting the impulse<br>
    to smooth her hair and check her lipstick. Odan, on<br>
    the other hand, seems perfectly comfortable.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Hello, Data...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have completed my study of the<br>
    atmospheric variations which have<br>
    occurred on the moons since the<br>
    new technology was implemented.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    Thank you, Commander. That will<br>
    be most helpful in my efforts to<br>
    mediate the quarrel.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I could go over them with you now.<br>
    It would not require more than<br>
    two hours.</p>
  <p> A brief, electric silence.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We do appreciate it, Data... but<br>
    the Ambassador and I have set<br>
    aside this time... to analyze<br>
    the incidence of lung disease<br>
    among the moons' inhabitants.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then it is perfect timing, Doctor<br>
    -- what better occasion to<br>
    integrate my results into your<br>
    study?</p>
  <p> Another silence, as Beverly and Odan exchange glances<br>
    past Data's innocent eyes. Her message: &quot;You get rid<br>
    of him.&quot;</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    Now that I think about it,<br>
    Commander... you're absolutely<br>
    right. Unfortunately, I'm not<br>
    feeling well... perhaps Doctor<br>
    Crusher could get you started,<br>
    inputting your information... but<br>
    I must I return to my quarters.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - 3/1/91 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (picking it up)<br>
    Ambassador, are you still having<br>
    those awful headaches?<br>
    I'll bring you a hypospray to take<br>
    care of it...</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    (rubbing temples)<br>
    I would be most grateful...</p>
  <p> The turbolift stops, and Beverly takes Data by the arm,<br>
    steers him out of the turbolift.</p>
  <p>4 INT. CORRIDOR (CONTINUOUS)</p>
  <p> as Beverly and Data exit. She turns back to Odan.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Put a cold cloth on your forehead<br>
    and lie down, Ambassador. I'll<br>
    be with you shortly.</p>
  <p> And the turbolift doors shut on Odan, unable to resist<br>
    an anticipatory smile. Beverly pulls Data down the<br>
    corridor at a good clip.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'll set you up at the medical<br>
    monitor, Data... it'll take you<br>
    a while to input the figures,<br>
    won't it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (puzzled by the speed)<br>
    At least an hour... but I do not<br>
    believe much time can be saved<br>
    from that estimate by exhibiting<br>
    such haste now...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Data... there are times... when<br>
    every second does count.</p>
  <p> And she propels him down the corridor, oblivious to<br>
    his perplexed expression.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/6/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 INT. ODAN'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Odan ENTERS and begins removing his shirt. He is a<br>
    handsome, strapping man with a well-defined<br>
    musculature. He moves toward the mirror, and places<br>
    his hand on his diaphragm.</p>
  <p> A grapefruit-sized area on his mid-section begins to<br>
    change color... then it swells into a purplish,<br>
    green-veined lump. Odan takes a device from the<br>
    counter, aims it toward the bulbous protuberance, and<br>
    envelops it in a spray of light. The growth throbs<br>
    there for a moment, then begins to recede again.<br>
    Whatever it is, Odan has just fed it, and it is content<br>
    once more.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/6/91 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>5A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> drops out of warp.</p>
  <p>6 INT. ODAN'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Beverly is donning her jacket, stops in front of the<br>
    mirror to run her fingers through her hair. Odan puts<br>
    on a robe and comes up to her, putting his arms around<br>
    her from behind. In the background, the bed is<br>
    discreetly rumpled.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    Somehow, I had an unnatural fear<br>
    that Data was going to barge in<br>
    and ask to discuss the peripheral<br>
    effects of magnetospheric energy<br>
    taps.</p>
  <p> Beverly giggles and he kisses her hair.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If I don't get back and look at<br>
    his projections, he might come<br>
    looking for me.</p>
  <p> She pulls loose, but he turns her around, facing him,<br>
    not letting go.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    When I first met the formidable<br>
    Doctor Beverly... I thought to<br>
    myself... &quot;This woman is ice...<br>
    through to her bones... &quot;</p>
  <p> He puts his face in her neck, murmuring.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    Who would have dreamed... that<br>
    instead of ice, there is fire...</p>
  <p> Beverly closes her eyes, yielding to his soft nuzzling.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can't believe this has<br>
    happened... in just a week...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/6/91 - ACT ONE 5A.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    (kissing her face)<br>
    Stay here... don't go...</p>
  <p> Blood is coursing now, but Beverly manages to pull away<br>
    slightly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - 3/1/91 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Odan... are we... is this...<br>
    interfering? With your work on<br>
    the Peliar Zel problems?</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    Fortunately I've done about as<br>
    much as I can until we get there.<br>
    (bending to her again)<br>
    Because I wouldn't be able to<br>
    keep my mind on work now...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Odan... I have to get back...</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    Promise me we'll be together<br>
    tonight...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I promise...</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    Then go, Doctor Beverly...</p>
  <p> She reaches out fingertips, touches his lips.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's just Beverly...</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    Not just Beverly. It's Beverly's<br>
    smile and her kindness, her<br>
    beauty, within and without. So<br>
    much more than just Beverly...</p>
  <p> He takes her wrist, turns it and kisses it gently on<br>
    the inside. Then --</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Picard to Ambassador Odan...</p>
  <p> The two lovers jump guiltily apart. Odan reaches for<br>
    his tunic, presses the com badge.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    Yes, Captain? This is Odan...</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    The Federation representative from<br>
    Peliar Zel has come on board.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/7/91 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE (Cont'd)<br>
    Could you meet us in the<br>
    Observation Lounge?</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    I'll be right there, Captain.</p>
  <p> He and Beverly exchange smiles.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    And Ambassador... if you should<br>
    run into Doctor Crusher, would<br>
    you ask her to join us as well?</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    By all means. If I run into her.</p>
  <p> He turns smiling to her and, though feeling a little<br>
    like a naughty child who's been found out, she smiles<br>
    back.</p>
  <p>7 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - A BIT LATER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard is already there, standing with LEKA, a<br>
    representative of the Federation planet Peliar Zel,<br>
    RIKER, TROI, and Data. Beverly ENTERS, nods toward<br>
    Picard, who nods back, expressionless. She moves<br>
    toward a seat next to Troi.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (sotto)<br>
    Where've you been?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (likewise)<br>
    With a patient. Minor emergency.</p>
  <p> Troi nods and then -- from the opposite door -- Odan<br>
    walks in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ambassador Odan, this is Governor<br>
    Leka Trion, of Peliar Zel.</p>
  <p> LEKA<br>
    Ambassador... thank you for<br>
    coming.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I knew your father.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/6/91 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LEKA (Cont'd)<br>
    His efforts helped keep our<br>
    people at peace for several<br>
    generations.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    I would hope to serve you as well<br>
    as he.</p>
  <p> Picard has gestured people to their seats; Odan finds<br>
    himself next to Data, who leans to him and says, in<br>
    an aside:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/7/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I hope Doctor Crusher was able<br>
    to help you with your headache.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    Thank you. Actually, she was.</p>
  <p> A little flicker between Odan and Beverly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Governor Leka has intercepted us<br>
    before we reached her planet in<br>
    order to update us on the<br>
    situation.</p>
  <p> LEKA<br>
    It has grown progressively worse.<br>
    The people on our moons have been<br>
    in discord ever since they<br>
    migrated from the planet five<br>
    centuries ago. For us on the<br>
    planet... it is like having two<br>
    squabbling children. We try to<br>
    help settle their arguments<br>
    without taking sides... but this<br>
    time, we are at a loss.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    I've been studying the information<br>
    you sent... If I understand<br>
    correctly, the people of Alpha<br>
    moon have found a way to tap<br>
    directly into the magnetic field<br>
    of your planet, and now rely<br>
    exclusively on that energy<br>
    source.</p>
  <p> LEKA<br>
    Yes. But the Beta moon seems to<br>
    be suffering some environmental<br>
    damage as a result.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My design models suggest that Beta<br>
    will begin to experience rising<br>
    temperatures... erratic tide<br>
    surges... and in general the<br>
    beginnings of global warming.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/8/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The impact on the health of the<br>
    Betan people is clear. There<br>
    will be profound medical<br>
    repercussions.</p>
  <p> LEKA<br>
    Alpha is unwilling to lose their<br>
    new-found energy source... Beta<br>
    accuses them of intentionally<br>
    courting genocide... our efforts<br>
    to find a compromise have failed.<br>
    And now --<br>
    (beat)<br>
    -- we've received intelligence<br>
    that both sides are arming for<br>
    war. If that happens... the<br>
    people of my planet will begin<br>
    to take sides... the outcome can<br>
    only be disastrous.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We will be in orbit around Peliar<br>
    Zel within six hours. If you can<br>
    arrange for the representatives<br>
    of Alpha and Beta to be there,<br>
    Ambassador Odan can beam directly<br>
    to the planet.</p>
  <p> Picard rises, indicating an end to the meeting.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    Excuse me, Captain... I would<br>
    prefer to shuttle to the surface.</p>
  <p> LEKA<br>
    I would not recommend it. There<br>
    are many radical factions involved<br>
    in this dispute. It would be<br>
    difficult to guarantee your<br>
    safety.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    (good-natured)<br>
    I'm sure I'm not the first who<br>
    has expressed discomfort with the<br>
    idea of molecular transport.<br>
    Thank you, but I much prefer to<br>
    keep myself intact. I'll shuttle<br>
    down.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/6/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As you like.</p>
  <p> The group files out.</p>
  <p>8 ANGLE - TROI</p>
  <p> quietly watching the room empty. Picard sees her,<br>
    approaches, curious.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor... ?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's Ambassador Odan... I continue<br>
    to feel such... fluctuations...<br>
    of emotion from him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (dryly)<br>
    Maybe it's just spring, Deanna...<br>
    (off her look)<br>
    Or perhaps these sensations are<br>
    perfectly normal among the Trill.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It could be... we know so little<br>
    about them...</p>
  <p> She shakes her head as though to rid it of a nagging<br>
    doubt.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But he seems a lovely person...<br>
    very much a gentleman, don't you<br>
    think?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. Quite.</p>
  <p> Troi leaves and we stay on Picard.</p>
  <p>9 INT. BARBER SHOP - LATER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Our blue barber works on N.D. crew in the background.<br>
    Beverly reclines on a lounge, either hand draped in a<br>
    bowl of translucent liquid. Her feet are bare, toes<br>
    freshly painted, held apart by a special little drying<br>
    rack.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/8/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> A cloth of special astringent is folded across her<br>
    eyes. Troi ENTERS, spies her, goes to an adjacent<br>
    lounge. She speaks nonchalantly...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Is that the colgonite astringent<br>
    you have on your eyes? I've never<br>
    tried it...</p>
  <p> Beverly starts a bit... lifts one corner of the<br>
    cloth... sees Troi looking at her innocently. Beverly<br>
    feels a little embarrassed to be found cosseting<br>
    herself.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes... I mean, I guess it is...<br>
    someone just put it on me...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I never knew you even came in<br>
    here...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't. I mean, not usually...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But sometimes it feels good just<br>
    to indulge yourself...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I guess so...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Especially when you haven't done<br>
    so for a while...</p>
  <p> Beverly pulls the cloth off, gives her a look. Is<br>
    there a double meaning here?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What's that supposed to mean?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Beverly... you're in love.</p>
  <p> Beverly is nonplussed. Is it that obvious?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How... how did you know?</p>

  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (gently)<br>
    I don't really think it's much<br>
    of a secret.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It isn't?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No. You've been -- glowing.</p>
  <p> Beverly gives her a look, then, realizing Troi is<br>
    absolutely right, she smiles... luxuriating in the<br>
    feelings.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    &quot;Glowing... &quot; Well, yeah... that's<br>
    just how I feel, Deanna...</p>
  <p> She looks to Troi for approbation... but sees something<br>
    else... a doubt, a misgiving...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What... ?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Nothing --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes, there is, I can tell. What<br>
    is it?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Just... something I sense in Odan.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What? What do you sense?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm not sure how to describe it...<br>
    and I'm not saying there's<br>
    anything wrong, it's just...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Beverly... how well do you really<br>
    know him?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I... I feel like I know him better<br>
    than anyone I've ever known...<br>
    but...</p>

  <p>9 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> She sits up, her overwhelming feelings now tapped, and<br>
    pours out a litany of vacillation.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Am I being foolish? I don't think<br>
    so... and yet... it's only been<br>
    a couple of weeks... Of course,<br>
    maybe that means it's just<br>
    infatuation... but I'm a grown<br>
    up, I know the difference between<br>
    love and infatuation...</p>
  <p> Troi regards her with amused tolerance. She is happy<br>
    that her friend is re-capturing some long dormant<br>
    feelings. Surely that's more important than that<br>
    nagging sense that Odan isn't what he seems...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But one thing I'm sure of... is<br>
    that I haven't felt like this in<br>
    a long time...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And you like it...</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at her, smiles.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I like it.</p>
  <p> And Troi returns the smile. Love covers many<br>
    blemishes.</p>

  <p> ODAN<br>
    You wanted to see me?</p>

  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Ambassador. We've entered<br>
    orbit... the shuttle will<br>
    transport you to the surface in<br>
    a few minutes.</p>

  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    I am ready, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How will you proceed once you're<br>
    there?</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    I cannot answer that. I never<br>
    know until I am into the<br>
    situation... meet the people<br>
    involved. I work very much by<br>
    instinct, not by pre-arranged<br>
    plan.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It seems to work well for you.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    I do like to go into a situation<br>
    as well informed as possible...<br>
    and your staff has been quite<br>
    helpful in briefing me on the<br>
    problems involved here.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Particularly Doctor Crusher.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My staff is quite capable. I'm<br>
    glad they've been useful.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    Your Doctor Beverly is an<br>
    extraordinary person... both as<br>
    a scientist... and as a woman.</p>
  <p> Picard is becoming uncomfortable with the frank nature<br>
    of this discussion.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure that's true. Well...<br>
    shall we make our way to the<br>
    Shuttlebay?</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    Captain... you know her better<br>
    than I... do you have any idea<br>
    how -- committed -- she is to<br>
    remaining with Starfleet?</p>
  <p> This catches Picard by surprise. Is Odan planning to<br>
    take Beverly off the Enterprise?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/8/91 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I wouldn't presume to speak for<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    Of course not. I just thought...<br>
    you've known her for so long...</p>
  <p> But before Picard can answer --</p>
  <p> ENSIGN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Ensign Taggert to Captain<br>
    Picard...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Ensign?</p>
  <p> ENSIGN'S COM VOICE<br>
    The shuttle is ready to transport<br>
    the Ambassador.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    I can find my own way, Captain.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I hope to bring good news when<br>
    I return.</p>
  <p> And he is gone. Picard stares after him, discomfited<br>
    by this conversation.</p>
  <p>12 INT. SHUTTLEBAY</p>
  <p> Odan moves with Geordi toward the shuttle, where Riker<br>
    and Beverly wait. Odan carries a small case.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Commander Riker asked to pilot<br>
    you himself, Ambassador.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    I am honored.</p>
  <p> But his eyes are on Beverly, and he goes to her, takes<br>
    her aside from the others.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    I don't know when I'll be back...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/7/91 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I know... have a safe trip.</p>
  <p> He smiles warmly, puts his arms around her as though<br>
    it were the most natural thing in the world, even with<br>
    the crew nearby.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    I will stay safe, Doctor<br>
    Beverly... I have good reason<br>
    to return...</p>
  <p> He opens his case, withdraws a rose... lovely and<br>
    graceful.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    I have researched earth customs.<br>
    This flower is given to express<br>
    love.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes, it is...</p>
  <p> She takes the rose, touched by this romantic gesture.<br>
    They smile at each other... he takes her wrist, turns<br>
    it to the inside, and kisses it. Then he moves toward<br>
    the shuttle. Beverly sniffs the heady fragrance of the<br>
    rose.</p>

  <p> Beverly ENTERS from the turbolift, takes a seat to view<br>
    the proceedings.</p>

  <p>14 INT. SHUTTLECRAFT - INTERCUTTING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker piloting; Odan at his side.</p>

    in two minutes, twenty seconds.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain... an unidentified ship<br>
    is emerging from the limb of the<br>
    moon.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hail the vessel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I have visual contact. I don't<br>
    recognize it.</p>
  <p> Worf works his controls.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, it claims to be an escort<br>
    vessel from the Beta moon.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There was no mention of an<br>
    escort... request a security<br>
    clearance code.</p>
  <p> A beat as Work does so...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They do not answer, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander, stand by to return to<br>
    the Shuttlebay.</p>

  <p> The shuttle banks to return to the Enterprise, but the<br>
    strange ship unloads phasers. The shuttle takes a hit.</p>
  <p>18 INT. SHUTTLE</p>
  <p> The impact throws Odan from his seat; he strikes his<br>
    head on the bulkhead and lands unconscious. Riker<br>
    struggles to control the helm.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Engage tractor beam. Number One<br>
    -- report.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've lost the port thruster and<br>
    both back-up stabilizers... I'm<br>
    losing control...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're bringing you in.</p>
  <p>19 EXT SPACE - SHUTTLE AND ESCORT SHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The tractor beam has locked on to the shuttle. The<br>

  <p>19A INT. SHUTTLE - INTERCUTTING</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, the shuttle hull has been<br>

    you can't tow us. Better beam<br>
    us directly on board...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/7/91 - ACT ONE 19.</p>
  <p>19A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Odan, on the floor, raises his head at this.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    (weak)<br>
    No... don't do it...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can't stabilize the shuttle...</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    If you transport me, it will kill<br>
    me... please...</p>
  <p> Riker stares at him, swiftly weighing the elements.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One... we're ready to beam<br>
    you aboard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Belay that, Captain. I'm going<br>
    to bring her in manually.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Advise Doctor Crusher we have a<br>

  <p> Beverly pales at this, realizing it could mean only one<br>
    thing.</p>
  <p>20 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Beverly and NURSE OGAWA work over Odan's nearly<br>
    lifeless body. He has a gash in his head and various<br>
    contusions to the upper body.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He's in shock... he's lost a lot<br>
    of blood... but that doesn't<br>
    account for these readings...</p>
  <p> She passes the Tricorder over him again, disturbed by<br>
    what she reads.</p>

  <p> Beverly looks up at her.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's as though there's a parasite<br>
    at work...</p>
  <p> Odan stirs and groans; Beverly leans in to him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Odan... I have to do exploratory<br>
    surgery. You may have a parasitic<br>
    infection...</p>
  <p> His hand reaches out and grasps her wrist.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    You must not.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But... you won't survive...</p>
  <p> Still holding her with one hand, Odan places the other<br>
    over his diaphragm.</p>
  <p>21 ANGLE - ON ODAN</p>
  <p> as the purplish lump begins to rise. Beverly stares in<br>
    stunned amazement.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What is that... ?</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    Beverly... that... is me...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What... ?</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    This body... is just a host. I<br>
    am that parasite... and that is<br>
    what must survive.</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/8/91 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>22 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Beverly and Odan; the nurse has departed.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    It has always been this way...<br>
    the Trill are a joined species...<br>
    a host and a symbiont... and in<br>
    this fashion we have survived for<br>
    millenia...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're dying... what can I do?</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    The host body is dying... You must<br>
    contact the Trill quickly... tell<br>
    them I need another host. They<br>
    will send a replacement.</p>
  <p> He holds her wrist tightly.</p>
  <p> ODAN<br>
    I know it is hard to accept...<br>
    but I beg you, Doctor Beverly...<br>
    help me... this mission must be<br>
    completed.</p>
  <p> He grips her wrist and she smiles down at him, rocked<br>
    by his revelation, but her love undiminished.</p>
  <p>23 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - LATER</p>
  <p> Beverly, drained and exhausted, sits at the table with<br>
    Picard, Riker, Troi, Geordi and Worf. She has been<br>
    recounting the bizarre tale, and the others listen<br>
    quietly in various states of contained amazement.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Odan's host body died of the<br>
    injuries just over an hour ago.<br>
    But the symbiont being...<br>
    Odan... is still alive.</p>
  <p> Even for a staff used to unusual life forms, this is<br>
    unique.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/8/91 - ACT TWO 22A.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Odan is the one who negotiated<br>
    the last treaty. The man everyone<br>
    thought was his father was just<br>
    another host body.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And the reason Odan refused the<br>
    transporter...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (acknowledging)<br>
    It would have damaged the<br>
    symbiont.</p>

  <p>23 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to the others)<br>
    We have contacted the Trill.<br>
    Another host will arrive within<br>
    forty hours.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've placed Odan in stasis.<br>
    He can survive for an hour...<br>
    maybe two... but not beyond that.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Is it possible I could serve as<br>
    a temporary carrier?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No, Data. The relationship<br>
    requires a biological being.</p>
  <p> There is a small silence.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are at a desperate impasse with<br>
    the situation in the Peliar<br>
    system. The attack on our<br>
    shuttlecraft has inflamed the<br>
    dispute.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Who was responsible, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No one will admit anything. Each<br>
    side accuses the other and threats<br>
    are mounting. We need Odan...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Doctor... could a human host carry<br>
    him?</p>
  <p> All eyes turn to him, realizing what he's suggesting.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/7/91 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I... believe so. From Odan's<br>
    description of the process... it<br>
    should be possible. But --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (rising)<br>
    Then I volunteer.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There's been no precedent for a<br>
    human host. I couldn't guarantee<br>
    what... what might happen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Would you be able to remove the<br>
    symbiont when the new host<br>
    arrives?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    In theory, yes. I just don't know<br>
    what might happen to a human body<br>
    in the process.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander... the risk is too<br>
    great.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Weigh it against the prospect<br>
    of war.</p>
  <p> Picard hesitates, considering the options. Finally --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is your choice, Will.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then let's get to it.</p>
  <p> And he heads for the door.</p>
  <p>24 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker lies on a bio-bed with his shirt off. On a<br>
    nearby table is a containment dome which holds the<br>
    purplish blob that is Odan. Beverly plays a Tricorder<br>
    over Riker.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've given you a local<br>
    anesthetic... but you must be<br>
    conscious while the implantation<br>
    takes place. Drugs might damage<br>
    the symbiont.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I understand.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks toward Nurse Ogawa.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Laser scalpel.</p>
  <p> Ogawa hands her the instrument and Beverly activates<br>
    it, then bends toward Riker, making an incision in the<br>
    navel. She completes the incision, then reaches for<br>
    the glass container, lifts the domed lid, and takes the<br>
    blob... Odan. She places it on the area in which she<br>
    has made the incision.</p>
  <p>25 CLOSE ON RIKER - INTERCUTTING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as he draws a deep breath. Ogawa sponges off his<br>
    forehead.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How are you feeling? Is there<br>
    pain?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No... just... strange<br>

    Ogawa hands Beverly the hypospray and she administers<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    I think he's stabilizing.</p>
  <p> Bev now takes a tricorder and scans.</p>

  <p> as Beverly sponges off his forehead. He stirs, rolls<br>
    his head... his eyes flicker a bit...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Will... it's Beverly. Can you<br>
    hear me?</p>
  <p> Now his eyes are open, slightly glassy... then looking<br>
    around the room... focusing on Beverly. A little<br>
    smile.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hello...</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (smiling back)<br>
    You're going to be all right.<br>
    How do you feel?</p>
  <p> Riker reaches out and holds her wrist.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I am just fine... but you look<br>
    tired, Doctor Beverly.</p>
  <p> Weakly, he turns her wrist to the inside and kisses<br>
    it. Beverly stares at him... realizing that Odan is<br>
    now very much alive -- in Riker's body.</p>

  <p>31 INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker stands with Picard before the viewscreen,<br>
    addressing Governor Leka.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I realize it will be disturbing,<br>
    Governor... but you must convince<br>
    the inhabitants of the moons that<br>
    I am Odan... I have his thoughts,<br>
    his memories, his skills...</p>
  <p> LEKA<br>
    They will perceive you as a<br>
    Starfleet officer... perhaps with<br>
    your own agenda...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The man they knew as my father...<br>
    the man who stands before them<br>
    now... both are merely hosts.<br>
    It is your task to help them<br>
    understand.</p>
  <p> LEKA<br>
    I will try. I cannot promise they<br>
    will listen. They are more<br>
    factionalized than ever, and<br>
    listening is a skill which seems<br>
    to have evaporated in the heat<br>
    of argument.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Speak softly, Governor. People<br>

    will often strain to hear a<br>
    whisper.</p>
  <p> LEKA<br>
    (after a beat)<br>
    I will do what I can.</p>
  <p> Riker nods and the screen returns to the starfield.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well done.</p>
  <p> But suddenly Riker stumbles slightly. He reaches out<br>
    to balance himself on Picard's shoulder.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sorry... a little dizzy...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, take the Ambassador<br>
    to his quarters.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll be all right... just need<br>
    to lie down a minute...</p>

    Yes, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Ambassador is not well.<br>
    Please see to him in his quarters.</p>

    what she might encounter. But --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Right away, sir.</p>
  <p>33 INT. ODAN'S QUARTERS - MINUTES LATER</p>
  <p> Beverly scans Riker with a Tricorder. She is cool,<br>
    professional, detached.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm getting a slightly elevated<br>
    white cell count... six-tenths<br>
    of a degree of temperature...<br>
    (casts a glance toward<br>
    him)<br>
    ... nothing that indicates<br>
    rejection.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's good...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But you look awfully pale...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Just a little weak...<br>
    light-headed...</p>
  <p> Beverly uses an instrument to peer into one of his<br>
    eyes.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Cerebral blood flow looks<br>
    normal...</p>
  <p> He reaches for her hand, puts it briefly in his.<br>
    Beverly becomes extremely uncomfortable, withdraws it,<br>
    moves to pack her Tricorder.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Beyond that, I don't know what<br>
    to do.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    This is... all new for me.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    For me as well.</p>
  <p> She leaves the hypospray near him, snaps shut her<br>
    medical carrier, and rises.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Please don't go... we need to talk<br>
    about this...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I... don't know what to say...<br>
    where to begin...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Nor do I... but I know that<br>
    silence will injure us...</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at him. The shock and discomfort of this<br>
    whole thing rise up in her.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Maybe you should have thought<br>
    about that sooner. Maybe you<br>
    should have told me what you were.<br>
    It didn't bother you to stay<br>
    silent yesterday...</p>
  <p> Riker shrugs in honest puzzlement.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But... it never occurred to me.<br>
    This is what I am... did you tell<br>
    me you are only a single being?<br>
    Of course not... it is normal<br>
    for you...</p>
  <p> And of course, that's reasonable. Her anger has no<br>
    place to go.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't know how to handle this...<br>
    I just... don't know who you<br>
    are...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (sadly)<br>
    I understand... but whoever I seem<br>
    to be... I am Odan... the man who<br>
    loved you... and that has not<br>
    changed. I still love you. I<br>
    can't help that.</p>
  <p> Anguished, she turns away from him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But if that causes you pain...<br>
    I will suppress it. I will keep<br>
    my distance, Doctor Beverly. I<br>
    would never hurt you.</p>
  <p> She turns, looks into his eyes, also searching. Who is<br>
    in there... is it the man she loved so desperately?<br>
    She can't tell. Without a word, she turns and EXITS.<br>
    Riker stares after her, in pain both physically and<br>
    psychically.</p>
  <p>34 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS - LATER</p>
  <p> Worf, Geordi, and Data play poker. Data deals.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Five card draw. Ante up.</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES and Riker ENTERS the room. Geordi and<br>
    Worf look happy to see him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Commander -- come on in...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi... I believe the correct<br>
    term now would be &quot;Ambassador.&quot;</p>
  <p> Riker smiles wanly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/6/91 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You can call me anything you like.<br>
    I know this must be difficult for<br>
    you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    May I join you?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (too quickly)<br>
    Sure! Sit down... right here...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are pleased you're here.</p>
  <p> Their eagerness sounds a false note. This is an<br>
    unusual situation for everyone. Riker sits and picks<br>
    up the deck.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Are you familiar with this game,<br>
    Ambassador?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> He shuffles and ruffs the cards with ease.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But... I seem to have done this<br>
    before...</p>
  <p> He begins dealing. With his guileless honesty, Data<br>
    gets right to the point.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ambassador, what is the precise<br>
    nature of the symbiotic joining?<br>
    Are you Odan? Or Commander Riker?<br>
    Or a combination of both?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I wish I could give you an answer<br>
    as simple as the question.<br>
    Ordinarily, the host body has no<br>
    personality. This time... is<br>
    different somehow.</p>
  <p> He looks down as he deals out the cards -- which he<br>
    does effortlessly and faultlessly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/6/91 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've never done this... and yet<br>
    I know how.</p>
  <p> He looks up to see them all looking at him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And something compelled me to come<br>
    here tonight... though I didn't<br>
    consciously know what would await<br>
    me. It is as though... Will Riker<br>
    is here with me... I have never<br>
    felt that with other hosts.</p>
  <p> The others regard him with a measure of discomfort. It<br>
    is weird... seeing the Riker who is so familiar to<br>
    them... but hearing someone else discuss him as though<br>
    he weren't there.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (rhetorical)<br>
    I guess the question is... will<br>
    the Commander be alright... when<br>
    he comes back?</p>
  <p> A dampening thought. Riker looks around the table...<br>
    realizes his presence makes them uneasy.</p>

  <p>34 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Gentlemen... I am making you<br>
    uncomfortable. Please... continue<br>
    without me.</p>
  <p> He EXITS, and no one argues with his going.</p>
  <p>35 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Beverly sits by herself at a table in the corner. She<br>
    gazes out at the brilliant star field, lost in thought.<br>
    Someone approaches the table; she senses, rather than<br>
    sees it, and looks up. Troi stands there.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    May I join you?</p>
  <p> Wordlessly, Beverly gestures to a seat, and Troi slides<br>
    in. For a moment the two stare out at the brilliant<br>
    mosaic.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (finally)<br>
    The first man I ever loved<br>
    unconditionally... was named<br>
    Stefan.</p>
  <p> She turns her chair around, plays with her teacup.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He was a soccer player... I would<br>
    watch him race down the field and<br>
    I thought my heart would stop<br>
    because he was so beautiful...</p>
  <p> She stirs her darkening tea.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We married and had three<br>
    children... twin boys, Andrew and<br>
    Alex, and then a girl, Jennifer...<br>
    Stefan became a famous artist and<br>
    created huge, breathtaking metal<br>
    sculptures... I kept house and<br>
    made the world easy for him...<br>
    and he came to adore me as much<br>
    as I worshipped him...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/8/91 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She looks up to see Troi's eyes on her.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    At least in my daydreams. Stefan<br>
    was eleven... and I was eight.<br>
    He never even knew I existed.</p>
  <p> A sad little smile from Troi, an unspoken moment<br>
    between them... When Beverly speaks, it is from utter<br>
    vulnerability.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Deanna... I loved Odan. I'm sure<br>
    of that... I had no doubts, no<br>
    fears...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    ... and now... I don't know what<br>
    it was I loved. His eyes... his<br>
    hands, his mouth... his body?<br>
    They're gone. If that was all<br>
    it was, I should mourn him and<br>
    go on...</p>
  <p> She hesitates, working the whole strange thing over in<br>
    her mind.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But there was so much more... I<br>
    felt completely free with him...<br>
    unguarded... at ease with<br>
    myself... There were so many<br>
    things that made him special to<br>
    me. Where are they? Are they<br>
    still here... alive in Will Riker?<br>
    I look at Will and I see someone<br>
    I've known for years... a kind of<br>
    brother. But... inside... is it<br>
    really Odan... ?</p>
  <p> She looks imploringly at Troi, a raw wound.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Help me, Deanna... please...</p>
  <p> Troi feels overwhelmed. She wants to comfort her<br>
    friend... but this whole situation is beyond anyone's<br>
    experience.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/6/91 - ACT THREE 37.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What... what do your feelings tell<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I feel the pull... it's<br>
    powerful...</p>
  <p> In her frustration, her anguish, she grasps for<br>
    anything that might have spared her this pain.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I wish he'd never come on this<br>
    ship... I was happy tending<br>
    patients and doing my research...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Don't wish that, Beverly... you<br>
    can never be open to love if you<br>
    won't risk pain...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't care... I'd give anything<br>
    not to feel the way I do now...<br>
    there's no happiness that's worth<br>
    this...</p>
  <p> She looks up as though she's heard an unseen voice and<br>
    sees --</p>

  <p> entering Ten-Forward, looking around, moving toward a<br>
    table.</p>
  <p>37 BACK TO TROI AND BEVERLY</p>
  <p> Beverly is pale.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He's here. He just walked in.</p>
  <p> Troi does not turn around. She looks right at Beverly.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Look at him.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't want to look at him...<br>
    Talk to me Deanna, please... keep<br>
    talking.</p>
  <p> Troi looks at her for a brief moment, leans in, takes<br>
    Beverly's hands.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The first man I ever loved... was<br>
    my father. He was strong and<br>
    tall... he carried me when the<br>
    ground was muddy... he chased away<br>
    the monsters who hid under my bed<br>
    at night... he sang to me and he<br>
    kept me safe. And then he went<br>
    away.</p>
  <p> A pause, then...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What I wouldn't give to hear his<br>
    songs again... to feel his arms<br>
    protect me. I never will. But<br>
    I can still feel his warmth, his<br>
    love... as though he were here<br>
    with me.<br>
    (Beverly acknowledges)<br>
    Beverly, if you can feel those<br>
    things from the man we know as<br>
    Will Riker, accept them, accept<br>
    the love.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at her... feels the strength and<br>
    affection in her grip. Slowly, she turns her head...<br>
    like a homing device, it finds Riker...</p>
  <p>38 RIKER - HER POV</p>
  <p> His eyes are on her, his gaze burning into her. Odan's<br>

    Ambassador Odan.</p>
  <p>41 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Beverly, and Riker. Riker doesn't look<br>
    good... weak, pale, and shaky. Beverly scans him with<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    White count is elevated... it's<br>

    Not much...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ambassador... I can stall the<br>
    representatives...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No. They would consider it<br>
    deception. I must meet them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Surely... to present yourself in<br>
    this condition... will not help<br>
    our cause.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I promise you, Captain... they<br>
    will not know I am ill.</p>

  <p> LEKA<br>
    May I present Kalin Trose, of<br>

    of Beta moon.</p>
  <p> KALIN TROSE<br>
    Thank you for receiving us,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> LATHAL BINE<br>
    Is this Ambassador Odan?</p>
  <p> He moves toward Riker, looking him up and down,<br>
    inspecting him. Riker has pulled it together, looks<br>
    a little pallid but otherwise all right.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lathal Bine... It was your aunt<br>
    who represented Beta thirty years<br>
    ago...</p>
  <p> LATHAL BINE<br>
    That is correct.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A formidable woman. I had the<br>

  <p> Riker gestures everyone into seats. The two<br>

    carefully.</p>
  <p> KALIN TROSE<br>

    Alpha... so long ago... ?</p>
  <p> Riker smiles at him, easy-going and comfortable.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It was you, of course, Kalin<br>
    Trose. Then you were a young man,<br>
    bristling with passion and zeal...<br>

    thorough knowledge of them... but still wary.</p>
  <p> KALIN TROSE<br>
    And... how did you manage to<br>
    achieve a compromise... between<br>
    that young man and the iron-willed<br>
    woman of Beta moon?</p>
  <p> A smile from Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They agreed to trade places for<br>
    a week... understand each other's<br>
    situation with more informed<br>
    eyes... after that -- an agreement<br>
    came swiftly.</p>
  <p> KALIN TROSE<br>
    Nothing you have said is beyond<br>
    what a school child could learn<br>
    from a history book.</p>

    Kalin Trose, you quelled a plot<br>
    by radicals on your moon to<br>
    assasinate the Beta delegation.</p>
  <p> KALIN TROSE<br>
    It... is true.</p>
  <p> There is a pause as the representatives digest this.</p>
  <p> LATHAL BINE<br>
    Perhaps he was wiser in his youth<br>
    than he is now. Odan -- you must<br>
    convince him to stop --</p>
  <p> Riker holds up a hand, stopping him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you accept me? Will you allow<br>
    me to work with you?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/6/91 - ACT FOUR 41A.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> There is a hesitation. The representatives look from<br>
    one to the other. Silence. Then --</p>
  <p> LATHAL BINE<br>
    Yes. The people of Beta moon<br>
    accept you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And Alpha moon?</p>
  <p> Kalin Trose stares at him, unresponding. Finally --</p>
  <p> KALIN TROSE<br>
    I will consider it. But I must<br>
    consult others.</p>
  <p> LATHAL BINE<br>
    This is a typical tactic... he<br>
    is an obstructionist, you can see<br>
    that --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Kalin Trose, you may confer with<br>
    your people. But we must have<br>
    your answer within eight hours.</p>
  <p> The three Peliar aliens rise.</p>
  <p> KALIN TROSE<br>
    You shall have it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/6/91 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> They head for the door, Leka the last out. Before she<br>
    leaves, she turns and smiles at Riker; she is<br>
    encouraged. The doors close. Riker sinks into his<br>
    chair, hands clenching the table. The others hurry<br>
    to him. He looks up, finds Beverly, his eyes frantic<br>
    with pain.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Beverly... help me...</p>
  <p>42 INT. SICKBAY - LATER</p>
  <p> Riker lies on a bio-bed, groggy. Beverly completes<br>
    a final test, and then moves off to the side, out of<br>
    ear-shot, where Picard is waiting.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    All his vital functions are<br>
    overworked. His immune system<br>
    is under attack. I can only guess<br>
    that he's going through classic<br>
    rejection syndrome.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there any treatment you can<br>
    give him?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can administer an<br>
    immunosuppressant. It would help<br>
    with the symptoms... but it<br>
    wouldn't correct the underlying<br>
    cause. He's carrying a foreign<br>
    organism in his body.</p>
  <p> She runs a hand through her hair, tired and frustrated.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't know what to do... medical<br>
    school didn't exactly prepare me<br>
    for a situation like this...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're doing all you can...</p>
  <p> Beverly gives him a look, a rueful laugh.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - 3/1/91 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Thank you. I wish that were more<br>
    comforting.</p>
  <p> She takes a breath, shrugs off anguish.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Don't worry about me, Captain.<br>
    I'm fine.</p>
  <p> They lock eyes for a moment, each acknowledging the<br>
    lie. Picard turns to Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ambassador... when you feel up<br>
    to it, please join me in my Ready<br>
    Room.</p>
  <p> He EXITS. Beverly goes to Riker, takes a hypospray<br>
    from an instrument table.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm giving you something that<br>
    should help you feel better. At<br>
    least temporarily.</p>
  <p> Beverly administers the injection. Riker takes a few<br>
    deep breaths... seems to relax... the pain goes from<br>
    his eyes as he gets relief.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The pain is gone... thank you...</p>
  <p> Then he takes her wrist, holds it firmly. Beverly<br>
    feels a wave of heat rising in her.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Please... don't...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let me touch you... just for a<br>
    moment...</p>
  <p> For a brief moment, she allows herself to yield to the<br>
    feelings. She reaches out... touches his face...<br>
    caresses his cheek... starts to bend to him...</p>
  <p> But she stops herself. This isn't right... Riker is<br>
    like her brother...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/6/91 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No... please...</p>
  <p> Never taking his eyes off Beverly, still holding her<br>
    wrist, he sits up. Then, forcing himself, he releases<br>
    her.</p>
  <p>43 INT. READY ROOM - A LITTLE LATER</p>
  <p> Riker with Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It was a fast decision, which we<br>
    must take as positive. The Alphan<br>
    representative has agreed...<br>
    somewhat dubiously... to let you<br>
    mediate the dispute.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I was sure they would. They are<br>
    reasonable people... just trapped<br>
    in their own anger.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have no doubt, however, that<br>
    they will bolt if anything goes<br>
    wrong in your discussions.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (grinning)<br>
    Then it's up to me to make sure<br>
    nothing goes wrong.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at him curiously; Riker is puzzled.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Have I said something wrong... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No... it's just... for a<br>
    moment... you sounded more like<br>
    Will Riker.</p>
  <p> There is a brief, uncomfortable moment. Then Picard<br>
    goes on briskly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have received word that your<br>
    new host will arrive in eighteen<br>
    hours. Will you be all right<br>
    until then?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/6/91 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The medication which Doctor<br>
    Beverly gave me has helped. I<br>
    will find a way to keep going.</p>
  <p> Picard hears the quaint phrasing of Odan's reference<br>
    to Beverly... it still makes him uneasy. They eye<br>
    each other.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It is an awkward situation for<br>
    her. As you can imagine.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. Yes, I certainly can.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And for you as well.</p>
  <p> Riker looks at him sadly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    My life has been spent... trying<br>
    to help others find solutions to<br>
    insoluble problems. And now...<br>
    I am confronted with one of my<br>
    own for which there is truly no<br>
    answer.</p>
  <p> Whether for Beverly, for Riker, or for the thoughtful,<br>
    sensitive being who speaks through Riker's mouth --<br>
    Picard feels profound sorrow.</p>
  <p>44 INT. BEVERLY'S QUARTERS - THAT NIGHT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Beverly ENTERS, weary from the day's anxieties, wanting<br>
    to unwind. She stretches her arms as she walks across<br>
    the room, then drops her neck and rolls her head. She<br>
    goes to the replicator.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Lemon tea...</p>
  <p> The replicator provides the tea and Beverly takes it,<br>
    sipping as she moves to a comfortable chair. She sits.<br>
    On the end table by the chair is the single rose that<br>
    Odan gave her before taking the ill-fated shuttle.<br>
    She regards it for a moment, then bends to inhale the<br>
    still-heady aroma.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/7/91 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>45 INT. ODAN'S QUARTERS - INTERCUTTING</p>
  <p> Riker paces, agitated.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Computer... location of Doctor<br>
    Beverly Crusher.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Doctor Crusher is in her<br>
    quarters.</p>
  <p> He starts toward the door, then flops down on a<br>
    chair, staring at nothing.</p>
  <p>46 INT. BEVERLY'S QUARTERS - INTERCUTTING</p>
  <p> Beverly holds the rose in her hands, staring at it, as<br>
    though in that way she could somehow leap back in time<br>
    to that day when she was so happy... when all the<br>
    universe was contained in Odan's eyes... She looks<br>
    up... as though hearing something -- someone -- calling<br>
    out to her...</p>
  <p>47 INT. ODAN'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Riker is up, pacing, unable to sit still. He goes to<br>
    the computer monitor, flips it on, stares at it,<br>
    switches it off again. He goes to his replicator.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Can you make balso tonic?</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    There is no formula on record.<br>
    Please supply a molecular<br>
    structure.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Never mind.</p>
  <p> Riker looks toward the door... takes a step toward<br>
    it... stops, turns back. He is in an anguish of<br>
    tension and indecision.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> Riker whirls as though struck. He stares at the door.<br>
    It CHIMES again.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Come in...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/6/91 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The door opens and Beverly is there. They look at each<br>
    other for a second, and then she ENTERS the room. The<br>
    Rubicon is crossed. During the next, their eyes are<br>
    never off each other.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I thought... I should see how<br>
    you're doing. If you needed<br>
    another hypospray...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't think so... the symptoms<br>
    have not returned...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Ah. Well... that's good.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> They take one more step toward each other.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Tomorrow is an important day.<br>
    Do you feel -- ready for it?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think so. I have been<br>
    preparing.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's good.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> One more step.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'll check your vital signs in<br>
    the morning... before the<br>
    representatives get here.</p>
  <p> They are very close now... the atmosphere between them<br>
    is as charged as an electrical storm... their eyes are<br>
    locked on each other.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They must not know I'm taking<br>
    medication...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - 3/1/91 - ACT FOUR 48.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You could arrange to take a series<br>
    of breaks...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's good...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> There is silence, waiting to be filled, but nothing<br>
    more to say. No more small talk. Beverly is all but<br>
    trembling... she must take one more step, just one,<br>
    toward him...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Beverly... I want you...</p>
  <p> She takes a breath, as though there is suddenly not<br>
    enough oxygen in the room...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If you are going to leave... you<br>
    must go now...</p>
  <p> One last beat... but she knows the answer.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm not leaving.</p>
  <p> And she flows into his arms. Their lips meet, and it<br>
    is as natural, as inevitable, as breathing. For the<br>
    moment she can't remember why she ever resisted.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>48 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> still in orbit.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 44824.4.<br>
    The representatives of Peliar Zel<br>
    and its two moons are ready to<br>
    transport on board. We have<br>
    learned that they each have<br>
    troops massed and are ready for<br>
    combat if this final effort at<br>
    peace is not successful.</p>
  <p>49 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, and Beverly. She is scanning Riker with<br>
    a Tricorder; he looks weak -- pale and clammy.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    White count is back up...<br>
    temperature elevated... the<br>
    effects of the medication are<br>
    wearing off faster every time.<br>
    (reaches for her bag)<br>
    I'll administer one now... and<br>
    hope it holds for an hour or<br>
    two...</p>
  <p> But Riker stops her arm.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No... no more.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at him, puzzled.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ambassador... it's clear you're<br>
    in pain. You can't get through<br>
    the next hours without help --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I must.</p>
  <p> He looks from one to the other.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/8/91 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Are the injections damaging the<br>
    host body... Riker's body?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes. I cannot put him at further<br>
    risk.</p>
  <p> Beverly stares at him, helpless, torn... what is the<br>
    right thing to do? Medical ethics never tackled this<br>
    problem...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But how can you function? Conduct<br>
    the meeting?</p>
  <p> He looks at her, gives a wan smile.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll manage.</p>
  <p> The look between them carries many messages... and<br>
    Picard is witness to them. There is an intimacy that<br>
    has never existed between these two before. He turns<br>
    away, feeling somehow an intruder.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We will respect your wishes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Further... I will conduct the<br>
    mediation today... but at the end<br>
    of today, regardless of the<br>
    outcome... I must be removed from<br>
    Riker's body. Even if the new<br>
    host has not yet arrived.</p>
  <p> Beverly is stunned by this.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But... you wouldn't survive...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Riker will not survive unless I<br>
    am removed. He has given<br>
    enough...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Odan...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Your word.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - 3/1/91 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> A pause. Beverly looks to Picard. He holds her look<br>
    for a moment, and then nods. Beverly turns back to<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Very well.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Worf to Captain Picard...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Mister Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    The representatives have arrived.<br>
    I will escort them to the<br>
    Observation Lounge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Riker, who rises. Taking a breath and<br>
    standing tall, he starts for the door. He passes<br>
    Beverly, stops... looks into her eyes... touches her<br>
    cheek... and EXITS. Beverly looks after him, then turns<br>
    to find Picard's eyes on her. A little embarrassed, she<br>
    becomes brisk and professional, closes up her medical<br>
    case.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'll stand by with the medication,<br>
    just in case. The pain may become<br>
    so intense --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Beverly...</p>
  <p> The tone of his voice, not at all that of her Captain,<br>
    makes her look up at him instantly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Whatever else I have been to<br>
    you... I am your friend. I cannot<br>
    imagine what you are going<br>
    through... but it must be a kind<br>
    of hell. I want you to know...<br>
    I am here... to help you... in<br>
    any way I can.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - 3/1/91 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> This unexpected gesture pulls the aplomb right from<br>
    under Beverly. She sinks onto a chair, head bowed,<br>
    unanticipated tears welling in her eyes.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jean-Luc...</p>
  <p> He comes to her, puts his hand on her shoulder. She<br>
    places her hand on his, and they remain there for a<br>
    moment, two old friends, sharing strength and pain.</p>
  <p>50 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>

  <p>51 INT. BRIDGE - LATER</p>
  <p> Picard, Beverly, Data, Worf, SUPERNUMERARIES as needed.<br>
    Beverly is a nervous wreck, trying to maintain control.<br>
    Picard covers better, but is as anxious.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Computer, what time is it?</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Fifteen thirty five hours.</p>

    hours...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain... a message from the ship<br>
    carrying the Trill host...</p>
  <p> Beverly turns to him, eager.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/8/91 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>51 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Are they here?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No. They are experiencing<br>
    difficulty. They do not<br>
    anticipate their arrival for<br>
    another nine hours.</p>
  <p> Beverly goes pale.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Nine hours...</p>
  <p> The door to the Observation Lounge opens, bringing both<br>
    of them to their feet. Riker steps through the door<br>
    and it shuts behind him. Beverly is on her way to him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ambassador...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It was worth it...</p>
  <p> He staggers, then collapses. Beverly is right there,<br>
    scanning him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They will not go to war...</p>
  <p> And he passes out. Beverly looks terrified by what<br>
    she sees on the Tricorder.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, make sure the<br>
    representatives are safely<br>
    transported off the ship.<br>
    (to Conn)<br>
    Ensign, set a course to intercept<br>
    the Trill ship. Prepare to go<br>
    to warp nine.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, it could take more than two<br>
    hours to reach the vessel.</p>
  <p> Picard looks down at Beverly, working over Riker.</p>

  <p>51 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I have no choice... I gave my<br>

  <p>52 INT. SICKBAY - LATER</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS, sees Beverly moving away from Riker's<br>
    bed. She looks exhausted -- ashen and drawn.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Will is all right. His vital<br>
    signs have stabilized... he's<br>
    sleeping now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And... how is Odan?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I have placed him in stasis. He's<br>
    fine for the moment.</p>
  <p> Picard nods, assimilating all this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You need some rest, Doctor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No. If Odan is to survive, he<br>
    must be implanted in the host as<br>
    soon as he arrives. I'll wait<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It will be some time yet.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I know.</p>
  <p> He hesitates a second, then yields to her wishes, turns<br>
    and EXITS. Beverly moves to a stool, next to a domed<br>
    container, and sits like a sentinel next to the<br>
    strange, throbbing mass that is Odan.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>53 WIDE SHOT OF DARKENED SICKBAY</p>

  <p> Beverly looks up, smiling... the smile freezes on her<br>
    face in a moment of astonishment as she sees --</p>
  <p>54 KAREEL - HER POV</p>
  <p> Standing with Worf at the door is a beautiful young<br>
    woman. She smiles... a strange, blank smile, empty of<br>
    personality.</p>
  <p> KAREEL<br>
    I am Kareel. I am to become host<br>
    to Odan.</p>
  <p>55 INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE - LATER</p>
  <p> Beverly sits dictating.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    ... the operation to implant Odan<br>
    into the new host was completed<br>
    at nineteen hundred hours and<br>
    appears to have been successful.<br>
    There have been no difficulties<br>
    with assimilation...</p>
  <p>55A KAREEL</p>
  <p> appears in the doorway. The woman is subtly<br>
    transformed. She is still sinewy and beautiful... but<br>
    there is spark to her eyes and dignity in her bearing.</p>
  <p> KAREEL<br>
    Doctor Beverly...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/7/91 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>55B ANGLE - BEVERLY</p>
  <p> Beverly turns off the dictation device, turns, sees<br>
    not an empty shell, but a woman of substance and<br>
    feeling.</p>
  <p> KAREEL<br>
    Could we talk for a moment?</p>
  <p> Beverly nods wordlessly and Kareel ENTERS, sits, looks<br>
    at her with sad, understanding eyes.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You should be sleeping. You need<br>
    rest.</p>
  <p> KAREEL<br>
    I've never felt better.<br>
    (a gentle smile)<br>
    Except once or twice...</p>
  <p> This reminder is uncomfortable for Beverly, who looks<br>
    down at her desk.</p>
  <p> KAREEL<br>
    My poor Beverly... this has been<br>
    so hard for you...</p>
  <p> Her voice is throaty, rich... as warm as velvet...</p>
  <p> KAREEL<br>
    I want to thank you... for your<br>
    caring... for standing by me...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I congratulate you. You averted<br>
    a war that would have cost many<br>
    lives...</p>
  <p> KAREEL<br>
    Yes. It seems... everything has<br>
    turned out for the best.</p>
  <p> Beverly gives her a glance... their eyes lock. An<br>
    unspoken question...</p>
  <p> KAREEL<br>
    And yes... I am still Odan... and<br>
    I still love you. I cannot<br>
    imagine that ever changing.</p>
  <p> Beverly doesn't answer. What is she to answer? She<br>
    feels drained, exhausted... it's all been too much, too<br>
    fast.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Host&quot; - REV. 3/6/91 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>55B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm glad you're all right.</p>
  <p> A silence... disappointment in Kareel's beautiful eyes.</p>
  <p> KAREEL<br>
    Is there to be nothing more?</p>
  <p> Beverly runs her hand through her hair, exhausted.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Perhaps it is a human failing...<br>
    but we are not accustomed to<br>
    these kinds of changes. I<br>
    can't... keep up. How long will<br>
    you have this host? What<br>
    would the next one be? I<br>
    couldn't live with that kind of<br>
    uncertainty...</p>
  <p> Kareel looks at her with sorrow.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Perhaps... someday... our ability<br>
    to love will not be so limited.</p>
  <p> KAREEL<br>
    I understand.</p>
  <p> Kareel rises and starts for the door.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Odan...</p>
  <p> Kareel turns back.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I do love you... please remember<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> Kareel's smile is full of sadness and longing... and<br>
    love. She goes to Beverly, takes her wrist.</p>
  <p> KAREEL<br>
    I will never forget you.</p>
  <p> And she kisses the inside of Beverly's wrist.</p>
