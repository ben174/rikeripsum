  <p> GEORDI (V.O.)<br>
    Personal log, Chief Engineer<br>
    Geordi La Forge, Stardate 44885.5.<br>
    I am en route to Risa to attend<br>
    an artificial intelligence<br>
    seminar. Captain Picard has<br>
    ordered me to arrive a few days<br>
    early to have some fun and<br>
    relax... I intend to follow his<br>
    orders to the very best of my<br>
    ability.</p>

    How about some different music,<br>
    Computer... something with a...<br>
    Latin beat...</p>
  <p> Mariachi music blares from the computer...</p>

    No... no, a gentle Latin beat...<br>
    a spanish guitar maybe...</p>
  <p> Spanish guitar with a gentle rhythm on the speaker...</p>

  <p>4 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it moves at warp speed.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 44891.6.<br>
    The Enterprise has been ordered<br>
    to accompany a special emissary<br>
    from the Klingon High Council to<br>
    the Kriosian System where one of<br>
    their colonies is fighting for<br>
    independence.</p>
  <p>5 INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD and RIKER are listening to the Klingon<br>
    Ambassador, KELL.</p>
  <p> KELL<br>
    There was a time when the Empire<br>
    would crush a rebellion. Today...<br>
    it is tolerated.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We have enough problems on the<br>
    home planet. We do not wish to<br>
    divert resources to this trivial<br>
    war.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are prepared to grant them<br>
    independence?</p>
  <p> KELL<br>
    (shrugging it off)<br>
    Perhaps. But we will conquer them<br>
    again later if we wish to.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Mind's Eye&quot; - REV. 3/19/91 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If I may ask, Ambassador, what<br>
    has this to do with us?</p>
  <p> Kell fixes his eyes on Picard.</p>
  <p> KELL<br>
    The Governor of Krios has charged<br>
    that the Federation is secretly<br>
    aiding the rebels.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker exchange a look.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Does he have evidence?</p>
  <p> KELL<br>
    The Council has sent me to examine<br>
    his evidence. It was my decision,<br>
    Captain Picard, to ask you to<br>
    accompany me. You are respected<br>
    by many on the council.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (thank-you)<br>
    K'adlo. I have been pleased to<br>
    offer occasional assistance to<br>
    the Klingon people in the past.</p>
  <p> KELL<br>
    Your modesty is human, Captain,<br>
    but I will excuse it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can assure you, Ambassador, the<br>
    Federation would never interfere<br>
    with the Empire's internal<br>
    affairs.</p>
  <p> KELL<br>
    Let us hope not. Such<br>
    interference would call into<br>
    question the very basis of our<br>
    alliance.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Mind's Eye&quot; - REV. 3/19/91 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> The stakes are clear.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, we'll be in a war zone...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed. Ambassador, I will ask<br>
    our chief security officer,<br>
    Lieutenant Worf, to report to you<br>
    for a full...</p>
  <p> KELL<br>
    Captain... Worf's discommendation<br>
    makes it very awkward. If I<br>
    could work with another of your<br>
    security officers...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (firm)<br>
    Mister Worf is my security chief<br>
    and my tactical officer. This<br>
    matter clearly falls within his<br>
    jurisdiction.</p>
  <p> KELL<br>
    (after a long beat)<br>
    As you wish.</p>
  <p>6 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Romulan Warbird is using a tractor beam to pull the<br>
    shuttle.</p>
  <p>7 INT. THE ROMULAN SHIP</p>
  <p> TWO GUARDS usher Geordi into a starkly lit chamber. At<br>
    one end of the room is a chair very much like a dental<br>
    chair. Various machines are positioned around it,<br>
    ready to be moved into place when needed.</p>
  <p> A bank of bright lights shine down onto the chair from<br>
    the other end of the room. Behind the lights we can<br>
    barely make out several shadowy figures. One of them<br>
    might be A WOMAN, but it's hard to be sure. Another<br>
    indistinct figure, a high ranking Romulan officer named<br>
    TAIBAK, speaks to Geordi:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Mind's Eye&quot; - REV. 3/20/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    Welcome, Mister La Forge. We've<br>
    waited a long time to meet you.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I can tell you've gone to a lot<br>
    of trouble.</p>
  <p> Taibak approaches Geordi and looks him over... it is<br>
    important to note he is not sinister, but a scientist<br>
    and Geordi is a test subject. Taibak has no delight in<br>
    making Geordi go through what he's about to go through,<br>
    it's just a job. He is quite casual about it, though<br>
    a certain pride in his work may peek through.</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    Indeed we have. You are going<br>
    to be of great help to us.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Don't count on it.</p>
  <p> Taibak motions to the guards, who lead Geordi off<br>
    toward the chair.</p>
  <p> Then Taibak motions to someone else, and a BLACK HUMAN<br>
    in a Starfleet uniform steps out from behind the<br>
    lights. The man puts on a fake VISOR just like<br>
    Geordi's. Taibak walks around the man, studying him,<br>
    then nods with satisfaction.</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    Good. Very good.</p>
  <p> As Geordi's double starts to leave...</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    (casual, serious)<br>
    Do not enjoy yourself too much<br>
    on Risa.</p>
  <p> Geordi's double nods, then EXITS.</p>
  <p>8 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Geordi has been strapped into the chair, head and body<br>
    held tightly in place; his back to the lights.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Mind's Eye&quot; - REV. 3/20/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Taibak nods to one of the guards, who steps forward,<br>
    removes Geordi's VISOR, then swivels him around to face<br>
    the lights.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hey!</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    Your VISOR will be returned to<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> During this, the other guard moves a large machine into<br>
    place behind Geordi. It has an adjustable appendage<br>
    shaped like a giant wrench; the guard positions the<br>
    device so that its open jaws frame Geordi's head.</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    But first... I want to show you<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Show me something? That should<br>
    be an interesting trick since I<br>
    can't see anything without the<br>
    VISOR.</p>
  <p> Taibak activates the machine, and two thin, metal rods<br>
    emerge from either side of the &quot;wrench.&quot; As their<br>
    blinking tips move toward Geordi's head...</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    That is not quite true.</p>
  <p> As soon as the rods touch his VISOR inputs, Geordi<br>
    reacts with a start.</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    Allow me to demonstrate.</p>
  <p> Taibak tabs another control and we see Geordi's<br>
    expression change. Taibak's lines are now delivered<br>
    for the benefit of the Woman who remains obscured<br>
    behind the lights.</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    I now have direct access to his<br>
    visual cortex. He has no choice<br>
    but to see what I wish him to see.</p>
  <p> Taibak activates a physiological monitoring system<br>
    which broadcasts Geordi's heartbeat into the room.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Mind's Eye&quot; - REV. 3/20/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    (casual, scientific)<br>
    I can feed him any image I choose.<br>
    He will be unable to ignore it.</p>
  <p> Taibak hits more controls, and we HEAR Geordi's heart<br>
    rate increase; see his teeth clench down.</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    His galvanic skin response has<br>
    increased nine percent. It seems<br>
    Commander La Forge, like many<br>
    humans, has a low tolerance for<br>
    watching others suffer.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (tight, desperation<br>
    showing)<br>
    Why... are you doing this?</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    I am sorry, Commander. It is a<br>
    necessary step. I apologize for<br>
    your discomfort. Here...</p>
  <p> He adjusts some panels. Geordi visibly relaxes, the<br>
    heartbeat falls...</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    (to the others)<br>
    Observe how a spring day on his<br>
    native Earth affects him... he's<br>
    looking at a beautiful meadow,<br>
    green trees, birds, a blue sky...<br>
    the heartbeat slows, the galvanic<br>
    skin response drops... the body<br>
    responds to our stimuli, he is<br>
    incapable of maintaining control<br>
    of his own responses... watch as<br>
    I change the stimuli again...</p>
  <p> Taibak presses a control and Geordi tightens up<br>
    again... the heartbeat increases...</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    Once our work is done, La Forge<br>
    will act normally... totally<br>
    unaware of his conditioning. The<br>
    perfect tool for our purpose.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Mind's Eye&quot; - 3/18/91 - ACT ONE 10A.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> The still unseen Woman speaks out from the shadows; a<br>
    questioning, authoritative tone in her voice.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    Will there be any physical<br>
    evidence of what you are doing<br>
    to him?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Mind's Eye&quot; - REV. 3/19/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    None, Commander. That is why we<br>
    chose La Forge. The utilization<br>
    of his pre-existing neural<br>
    implants makes our work impossible<br>
    to detect.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    How will we be certain your<br>
    procedure has been successful?</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    I will program him to perform a<br>
    series of specific tests... both<br>
    before he leaves us and after he<br>
    returns to the Enterprise. We'll<br>
    be able to verify his<br>

  <p> Taibak cocks his head, listening to Geordi's heartbeat<br>
    which is now noticeably slower.</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    Notice that his heart rate has<br>
    slowed somewhat. He is becoming<br>
    accustomed to the horrors he is<br>
    witnessing...</p>
  <p> He presses a panel... Geordi's vital signs jump<br>
    again...</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    (beat, continuing)<br>
    ... so we change horrors. This<br>
    will occur several times before<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Mind's Eye&quot; - 3/18/91 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> This situation is awkward for Worf; he tries to get<br>
    through it by being as businesslike as possible.</p>
  <p> Kell is talking security as the scene begins but this<br>
    scene is not about security... it is about Kell<br>
    considering his relationship with Worf, deciding how<br>
    to approach him on a more personal level. That subtext<br>
    is present from the very start.</p>
  <p> KELL<br>
    There have been two rebel attacks<br>
    on neutral freighters... one<br>
    Ferengi, the other Cardassian...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Both were engaged near the Ikalian<br>
    asteroid belt... that is where<br>
    the rebels must be hiding...</p>
  <p> KELL<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    The actinides in the asteroids<br>
    provide effective protection from<br>
    our sensors.</p>
  <p> Worf nods, thoughtfully concludes...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They might attack a freighter but<br>
    I doubt they would challenge a<br>
    Federation starship.</p>
  <p> KELL<br>
    (fishing)<br>
    Especially if the Federation is<br>
    providing them support.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (eye to eye)<br>
    You would test the Captain's word<br>
    with me, Kell? Is it because I<br>
    have no honor in your eyes that<br>
    you expect me to be disloyal?</p>
  <p> KELL<br>
    (studying him)<br>
    It was wrong of me to ask. My<br>
    apologies.</p>

  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain Picard does not lie.<br>
    If he says there is no Federation<br>
    assistance to the rebels, there<br>
    is none.</p>
  <p> KELL<br>
    Good. Because I have risked my<br>
    own reputation and honor by coming<br>
    to Picard.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He will not disappoint you. If<br>
    that is all...</p>
  <p> Kell nods, Worf starts to leave... then Kell decides<br>
    to speak up...</p>
  <p> KELL<br>
    There are some members of the high<br>
    council, Worf, who would thank<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Thank me?</p>
  <p> KELL<br>
    For killing Duras. Had he lived,<br>
    there is no doubt he would have<br>
    ascended to head the council.<br>
    Many... were not looking forward<br>
    to that.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    My motives were personal. Not<br>
    political.</p>
  <p> KELL<br>
    Motives? Who cares for motives?<br>
    Humans perhaps. What matters is,<br>
    you acted that day as a true<br>
    Klingon.</p>
  <p> This is a great compliment to Worf and he bows in<br>
    acknowledgement and exits.</p>

  <p>15 ANGLE ON O'BRIEN - INTERCUTTING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as seen in Geordi's POV -- the wealth of information<br>
    from his VISOR is so overwhelming it's difficult to<br>
    recognize him. Then telemetry information appears...<br>
    reminiscent of a targeting grid. An &quot;x&quot; axis runs<br>
    along the bottom of the frame, a &quot;y&quot; axis up the left<br>
    side -- Romulan numbers mark the increments.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's Chief O'Brien.</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    How long has he served with you?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Almost four years.</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    I want you to kill him.</p>

    Geordi.</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>

    VISOR, more telemetry information appears. An eerie<br>
    MUSIC CUE used here will re-occur whenever we go to<br>
    Geordi's POV or whenever his conditioning is activated.</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    Now what did I ask you to do?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Kill Chief O'Brien.</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>

  <p> As O'Brien turns, Geordi hesitates a second time. He<br>
    looks down at the phaser in his hand... then suddenly<br>
    fires. O'Brien is thrown to the floor, dead.<br>
    O'Brien's holo-friends at the table glance at O'Brien<br>
    but are not upset.</p>
  <p> TAIBAK<br>
    Good, Mister La Forge. Very good.<br>
    Why don't you enjoy a drink with<br>
    your friends?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Mind if I join you guys?</p>

    collecting his belongings.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Welcome back, Geordi. How was<br>
    the seminar?</p>
  <p> Geordi stands, faces Data, smiles.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Very informative, Data. I'll tell<br>
    you all about it.</p>

    Yeah, when I heard the Enterprise<br>
    had been ordered to the Krios<br>
    system...<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I was joking...</p>

    Joking. Ah. &quot;Forced to endure&quot;<br>
    Risa. Your actual intent was to<br>
    emphasize that you did enjoy<br>

    Governor, what exactly do you<br>
    believe the Federation has done?</p>

    Your medical supplies have been<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Even if these weapons do prove<br>
    genuine, I assure you some third<br>
    party is involved. The Federation<br>
    is not in the business of arming<br>
    rebellions.</p>
  <p> VAGH<br>
    This is the only Klingon colony<br>
    on the border of Federation space.<br>
    You cannot deny that Starfleet<br>
    would be happy to see Krios gain<br>
    its independence... it would<br>
    reduce your vulnerability to an<br>

  <p>35A CLOSE ON GEORDI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> who has his eye at the sighting device of a phaser<br>
    rifle... his hand on the trigger... we don't see what<br>
    he's shooting at but he's intent, focused... he<br>
    fires...</p>
  <p>36 INT. ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Now we see that he's test firing the rifle, which is<br>
    held in a test stand with its muzzle inside a<br>
    containment chamber. Data is there, scanning<br>
    information displayed on the pool table.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Energy flow is within normal<br>

    Rapid nadion pulse is right on<br>
    target... beam control assembly,<br>

  <p> Geordi taps a control on the phaser; the beam varies<br>
    a little.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Beam width and intensity controls<br>
    also responding correctly.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Energy cell usage remains<br>
    constant at one-point-oh-five<br>
    megajoules per second.</p>
  <p> Then Data responds to something he sees on a nearby<br>
    display.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Curious, the efficiency reading<br>
    on the discharge crystal is well<br>
    above Starfleet specifications.</p>
  <p> Geordi takes a look at that one. He shuts off the<br>
    rifle momentarily.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Let's take a closer look at the<br>

    so little energy.</p>
  <p> He activates the rifle again; they study readouts.</p>

    There... that's not right... the<br>
    initial output spike is<br>
    inverted...</p>

    That might suggest that the weapon<br>
    has been charged with a forced<br>
    pulse... well into the terahertz<br>
    range.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Romulans have always wanted<br>
    to destroy the alliance between<br>
    the Federation and the Klingons.<br>
    Had Mister La Forge killed you,<br>
    Governor, I think you would agree,<br>
    they might very well have<br>
    succeeded.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Who sent these signals? A cloaked<br>
    Romulan ship?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, that would not be possible.<br>
    The signals had to be transmitted<br>
    in close proximity to the VISOR.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then you're suggesting that a<br>
    Romulan accomplice was in close<br>
    proximity to La Forge whenever<br>
    he received the signals...</p>

    Yes, sir, I am.</p>
  <p> VAGH<br>
    This Romulan accomplice... who<br>
    is he?</p>

  <p>97 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have narrowed the list of<br>
    possibilities to two people...<br>
    the only two people who were with<br>
    Commander La Forge all three times<br>
    a transmission was recorded.<br>
    Captain Picard and Ambassador<br>
    Kell.</p>
  <p> Picard glances at Kell...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    One of them may be concealing<br>
    an E-band transmitter. If they<br>
    would agree to be searched...</p>
  <p> KELL<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    I am a Klingon... an emissary of<br>
    the High Council. I will not be<br>
    subjected to a search by you or<br>
    anyone else on this ship...</p>
  <p> VAGH<br>
    (stonily)<br>
    I agree.</p>
  <p> He gestures toward his guards, who quickly seize Kell.</p>
  <p> VAGH<br>
    We will take the ambassador with<br>
    us and search him ourselves.</p>
  <p> Kell realizes he's in deep trouble now.</p>
  <p> KELL<br>
    Captain, I believe... it is...<br>
    in everyone's best interests that<br>
    I remain on board. For the time<br>
    being. I formally request asylum.</p>
  <p> A long beat. In measured tones...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will certainly grant you asylum,<br>
    Ambassador, as soon as you are<br>
    absolved of this crime.</p>

  <p> Kell takes a deep breath, knows he's finished. Picard<br>
    nods to Vagh.</p>

  <p>100A INT. GEORDI'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Geordi and Troi are sitting and talking quietly.<br>
    Geordi is absolutely his usual self... though a little<br>
    perplexed by Troi's gentle probing.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I was on Risa. I took long walks<br>
    every morning... I went to the<br>
    beach, I swam...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And if I told you that you never<br>
    went to Risa at all...</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>

    But I went in the ocean... the<br>
    water was so salty I can still<br>
    taste it... no, it's just not<br>
    possible... find a woman named<br>
    Jonek... we spent a lot of time<br>
    together... she'll tell you...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There was no Jonek, you never<br>
    swam in the ocean...</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But I remember... everything.<br>
    Like one night there was this<br>
    Andorian waiter who couldn't get<br>
    our orders right. He brought us<br>
    a Klingon dinner... and it was<br>
    still moving.</p>
  <p> Geordi laughs; Troi smiles gently.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It did happen. I remember it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I know you do. Just take that<br>
    memory... and put it aside for<br>
    a moment... and tell me what you<br>
    remember about the shuttle craft<br>
    trip after you left the<br>
    Enterprise...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I was just trying to get in the<br>
    mood... played a little music...<br>
    talked to the computer... you know<br>
    how it is on a long trip...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And when you saw the Romulan ship<br>
    did you try to call for help?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, the first thing I did...<br>
    wait a minute, that's...</p>

  <p>100A CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Geordi's words trail off. He stares at Troi for a<br>
    long moment. Then...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It will take time, Geordi... a<br>
    long time, but we will reconstruct<br>
    your memory... together.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (beat, scared)<br>
    I'm... not sure... of anything.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Believe it or not, that's a good<br>
    sign... a beginning. Now, go back<br>
    again to the shuttle... There<br>
    was a Romulan ship... and the<br>
    first thing you did was... ?</p>
  <p> Stay on Geordi a long beat as he just sits there...</p>
