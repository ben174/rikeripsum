    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is on the outskirts of a DARK MATTER NEBULA.<br>
    This material is not normally visible to the eye, so<br>
    all we should see at this point is a large black space<br>
    devoid of stars hanging in front of the ship. Perhaps<br>
    some nearby stars around the periphery of the nebula<br>
    are partly obscured by the gaseous material, thus<br>
    indicating that something is blocking our view.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log: Stardate 44932.3<br>
    The Enterprise is preparing to<br>
    enter the Mar Oscura, an<br>
    unexplored dark matter nebula<br>
    first identified over a century<br>
    ago.</p>
  <p>2 INT. TORPEDO BAY</p>
  <p> This is the torpedo operations center. Launch bays for<br>
    torpedos are set into one of the bulkheads. DATA is<br>
    working on a photon torpedo which has been slid out of<br>
    one of the launch bays.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Commander Data is modifying<br>
    several of our photon torpedos<br>
    for an experiment designed to<br>
    elicit more information about this<br>
    unusual phenomenon.</p>
  <p>3 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Revealing ENSIGN JENNA D'SORA as she moves over to<br>
    assist Data. Jenna is of Mediterranean descent,<br>
    petite, and almost fragile in appearance. But her<br>
    doll-like face belies the fact that she is a veteran<br>
    security officer who could probably hold her own<br>
    against anyone aboard ship. Emotionally, as we will<br>
    learn, she is more fragile.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - REV 4/17/91 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> On the surface this manifests itself only as an<br>
    eagerness to please, a puppy-dog friendliness that asks<br>
    for approval and affection.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - 3/20/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The initial dispersal pattern<br>
    should not be more than seven<br>
    kilometers in diameter.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    (makes adjustment)<br>
    Six point eight kilometers...</p>
  <p> Jenna is just a tiny bit distracted, a little quiet...<br>
    but it's enough for Data to pick up on.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That should suffice.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Is there something occupying your<br>
    thoughts, Jenna? You are somewhat<br>
    subdued today...</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    I bumped into Jeff in the<br>
    turbolift again this morning.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Was the experience as emotionally<br>
    problematic as last week's<br>
    encounter?</p>
  <p> Beat... Jenna doesn't answer directly, but keeps going<br>
    with her thought.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    He... asked me to dinner.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What was your response?</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    I told him I'd think about it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    As you requested, I must now<br>
    remind you of the reasons you<br>
    decided to end your relationship<br>
    with Jeff.</p>
  <p> Jenna's eyes roll slightly... and there's a bit of<br>
    humor in her expression... a small bargain between<br>
    friends.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - REV. 4/8/91 - TEASER 3-3A. </p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    I guess I asked for this... go<br>
    ahead.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You objected to the fact that Jeff<br>
    seemed unwilling to set aside<br>
    sufficient time for you. You said<br>
    he never did... the little things.<br>
    He was unresponsive. You disliked<br>
    the sound he made when he ate his<br>
    soup...</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    (with humor)<br>
    Okay, okay... I remember.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This is the third time I have<br>
    refreshed your memory. Do you<br>
    wish to rescind our agreement?</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    No, no. It's for my own good.<br>
    It's just so easy to forget.<br>
    (indicates device)<br>
    Hand me that sequencer.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Many lovers throughout history<br>
    have had similar difficulties.<br>
    Anne Boleyn was quite distressed<br>
    that Henry the Eighth preferred<br>
    the company of his huntsmen to<br>
    that of his wife.</p>
  <p> Data hands her a small instrument. She waves it a few<br>
    times over the inside of the torpedo, taking a reading.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - REV. 4/8/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    (wryly)<br>
    As I recall, she ended up losing<br>
    her head. I guess I'm well out of<br>
    this.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    When did you develop an interest<br>
    in romantic historical figures?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Six weeks ago, when you and Jeff<br>
    dissolved your relationship, I<br>
    saw an excellent opportunity to<br>
    study that aspect of human<br>
    intimacy. Also, I believed it<br>
    was my obligation to do so.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    &quot;Obligation&quot;? What do you mean?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I anticipated this would be a<br>
    difficult period for you. As your<br>
    friend, it is my responsibility<br>
    to be supportive in times of need.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    (genuinely touched)<br>
    That is really sweet, Data.</p>
  <p> She looks at him with gratitude, affection... and<br>
    something more...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - REV. 4/1/91 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Data closes the panel on the torpedo. Jenna moves to<br>
    a control console on the bulkhead. Data gives<br>
    everything one final check and then steps away from<br>
    the torpedo and nods to Jenna. She works the controls<br>
    and the torpedo SLIDES INTO the launch bay.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (hits communicator)<br>
    Data to Bridge. We are ready for<br>
    the first illumination test.</p>
  <p>5 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> RIKER in Command, ENSIGN MCKNIGHT at Con, WORF at<br>
    Tactical.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Acknowledged. All science<br>
    stations stand by... we're about<br>
    to light up the nebula. Mister<br>
    Worf?</p>

    Fire torpedo.</p>
  <p> Worf works the console.</p>
  <p>6 INT. TORPEDO BAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data and Jenna are reading displays and working<br>
    consoles. A SOUND EFFECT is heard and some lights<br>
    FLASH to indicate the torpedo launch. A display<br>
    monitor gives an EXTERIOR VIEW of the nebula outside<br>
    the ship.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - 3/20/91 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The torpedo DISAPPEARS into the nebula. After a couple<br>
    seconds, the torpedo EXPLODES and there is a BRILLIANT<br>
    SHOW OF LIGHT. The dark matter has been illuminated<br>
    by the display and the gaseous cloud can be seen<br>
    clearly for the first time.</p>
  <p>8 INT. TORPEDO BAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data and Jenna watch the monitor.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    (softly)<br>
    It's beautiful.<br>
    (she moves closer to<br>
    him)<br>
    Like watching fireworks when I<br>
    was a little girl.</p>
  <p> Jenna turns her gaze to Data... and there is a great<br>
    deal more in her look than simple friendship. We get<br>
    another hint of her growing feelings for him. As they<br>
    watch the brilliant light show together...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - REV. 4/2/91 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>9 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> A woodwind quintet composed of Data (oboe), Jenna<br>
    (flute), KEIKO, (clarinet) and TWO N.D. MALE<br>
    CREWMEMBERS (bassoon, French horn), is playing a piece<br>
    of music to the patrons in the room, including O'BRIEN.</p>
  <p> The music comes to a stop and there is APPLAUSE from<br>
    the audience. The members of the quartet stand and<br>
    acknowledge the crowd. O'Brien moves toward the<br>
    &quot;stage&quot; area along with a few other well-wishers.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (to Keiko)<br>
    It was wonderful.</p>
  <p> He gives her a quick kiss.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Thanks.</p>
  <p> Data sets down his instrument, Jenna keeps her flute in<br>
    hand, still stares at her music, obviously unhappy.<br>
    Data cocks his head in puzzlement.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Is anything wrong?</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    My tempo was off. I felt like<br>
    I was really rushing it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not believe that is so. Your<br>
    rhythmic control has improved<br>
    markedly. I heard no fluctuations<br>
    during the performance.</p>
  <p> She relaxes a bit -- Data's support means a lot to her.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    Well, maybe. But I ruined the<br>
    coda. I got confused with the<br>
    phrasing... I kept breathing at<br>
    the wrong times.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - REV. 4/2/91 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The contrapuntal nature of the<br>
    composition is quite demanding.<br>
    We will give the rhythmic<br>
    patterns more attention in our<br>
    next rehearsal.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    However, I am quite certain that<br>
    the audience was oblivious to such<br>
    nuances. They seemed to enjoy<br>
    the performance thoroughly.</p>
  <p> She looks at him and smiles -- his kind attention makes<br>
    her feel better.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    Thanks, Data... you're really<br>
    sweet.</p>
  <p>10 INT. TEN FORWARD - LATER</p>
  <p> A short time later. Data, Jenna, Keiko, and O'Brien<br>
    are sitting at one of the tables, sharing drinks.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - REV. 3/27/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    ... every night, Miles leaves his<br>
    socks on the floor. When we got<br>
    married, I made the mistake of<br>
    picking them up a few times...<br>
    then I realized if I kept it up<br>
    I'd be doing it the rest of my<br>
    life... so I stopped... figuring<br>
    he'd get the message and do it<br>
    himself.</p>
  <p> Miles smiles easily, unbothered.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    One night goes by... two... a<br>
    week... ten days... by now there's<br>
    a pile of socks half a meter<br>
    high!</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Come on... it wasn't half a<br>
    meter...</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    After two weeks I couldn't stand<br>
    it any more -- I bundled them up<br>
    and put them in the cleaning<br>
    processor. And I'm still doing<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    And a very good job of it she<br>
    does, too...</p>
  <p> He winks broadly at Data as Keiko whirls on him, rising<br>
    to the jibe. O'Brien laughs and puts his arm around<br>
    her. They kiss lightly on the lips, a loving couple<br>
    accepting each other's faults and foibles. Jenna<br>
    regards them, a look of faint envy crossing her face.<br>
    She glances at Data, touches his arm occasionally, and<br>
    as she talks, her manner suggests that they, too, are<br>
    a couple...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - REV 4/17/91 - ACT ONE 9-9A. </p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    Keiko, you sound just like Data.<br>
    He came to my quarters the other<br>
    day to give me a music lesson,<br>
    and he said the funniest thing...<br>
    how did you put it, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe I observed that you seem<br>
    to have an aversion to<br>
    orderliness... but it was not<br>
    intended as a humorous remark...</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    So before we started, he gallantly<br>
    offered to help me straighten up.</p>
  <p> She threads her arm fondly through his, clearly wanting<br>
    to establish that they, too, have this easy-going<br>
    relationship.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And a very good job of it I did,<br>
    too.</p>
  <p> He gives O'Brien a broad wink and the group laughs.<br>
    Data is pleased that he has caused this reaction --<br>
    though he's not entirely certain why.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Report, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am nearly finished compiling<br>
    the readings from our most recent<br>
    illuminatory burst. They differ<br>
    considerably from surveys of<br>
    similar nebulae.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How so?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Dark matter density is nearly one<br>
    order of magnitude higher than<br>
    previously found.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Lifeforms here may have developed<br>
    in ways never before observed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Interesting hypothesis. Are there<br>
    any M-Class planets we could check<br>
    out?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Several, Sir. The nearest is<br>
    approximately three light years<br>
    from our present position.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - REV 4/17/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's worth a look. We'll continue<br>
    with our survey along the way.<br>
    (to McKnight)<br>
    Ensign, get the planet's<br>
    coordinates from Commander Data<br>

  <p>16A INT. SICKBAY (PREVIOUSLY SCENE 11)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY and a NURSE are standing at the large wall<br>
    monitor, running a complex experiment.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Nurse)<br>
    Let's increase the flow rate --<br>
    see if that helps.</p>
  <p> The Nurse nods and then leaves. Beverly looks at the<br>
    monitor for a beat, then moves toward her office.</p>
  <p>16B ON BEVERLY (PREVIOUSLY SCENE 12)</p>
  <p> As she walks by a RACK OF INSTRUMENTS on the wall...<br>
    Several steps past it she hears a glassy, metallic<br>
    CLINK! She stops... looks back at the rack in<br>
    puzzlement... then looks down at the floor.</p>
  <p>16C NEW ANGLE (PREVIOUSLY SCENE 13)</p>
  <p> Revealing a MEDICAL INSTRUMENT lying on the deck<br>
    beneath the rack. She's puzzled.</p>
  <p> She looks around, but there's no one here at the<br>
    moment. With a trace of annoyance, Beverly picks up<br>
    the instrument and replaces it in the rack.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - REV 4/17/91 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>17 INT. TORPEDO BAY</p>
  <p> Data and Jenna are working on an open photon torpedo.<br>
    Jenna is installing a small cannister inside the<br>
    central chamber of the torpedo. Data monitors with<br>
    a small digital instrument. The work doesn't require<br>
    their constant attention.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    Sometimes in the summer we went<br>
    on cookouts... just my little<br>
    brother and me, and Mother... She<br>
    was hopeless without a replicator.<br>
    But we didn't care.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Children often do not develop a<br>
    discerning palette until well<br>
    beyond adolescence.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    It's wasn't that. It just felt...<br>
    so good to be together... as a<br>
    family. We didn't have much of<br>
    that after my father died... so<br>
    those times were really special.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I wish we were back there now...<br>
    you and I...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The unidirectional nature of the<br>
    time continuum makes that an<br>
    unlikely possibility.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    (laughs)<br>
    That's one thing I've always loved<br>
    about you. You make me laugh.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You know, maybe I've been with<br>
    the wrong men. Why couldn't they<br>
    be like you, Data? You've got<br>
    everything.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is not true. I have no human<br>

    I don't know if you're aware of<br>
    it... but you're very handsome...</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>18 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> It's after hours and the room is deserted. GUINAN is<br>
    mixing several drinks in odd-shaped glasses on the bar.<br>
    Data ENTERS, there is a lost, puzzled expression on<br>
    his face.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Hi, Data. Want to try something<br>
    new?</p>
  <p> Data sits at the bar and looks at the drinks she's<br>
    making with only slight curiosity.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This is a concoction I heard about<br>
    on Prakal Two. I think it's<br>
    great, but I want another opinion,<br>
    so...</p>
  <p> She carefully combines a yellow and a blue liquid in<br>
    a glass, producing a sickly green potion. She offers<br>
    it to Data. He takes a small drink. She waits for<br>
    a reaction.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Eighty-seven percent Saurian<br>
    Brandy... Targ milk and Denevian<br>
    mead comprise the rest... an<br>
    unusually high concentration of<br>
    mono-saccharides and fructose<br>
    compounds.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Too sweet, huh?</p>
  <p> Data gives her a look -- &quot;Kool Aid.&quot; Guinan drinks<br>
    some of the potion herself and Data retreats into<br>
    thoughtful silence.</p>

  <p> Guinan quickly picks up on the fact that something's<br>
    on his mind.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    If I didn't know you better, I'd<br>
    say you were... preoccupied.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ensign D'Sora just gave me what<br>
    could be considered a very...<br>
    passionate kiss in the Torpedo<br>
    Bay.</p>
  <p> Guinan gives him a long piercing look.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Really?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    How did it make you feel?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I cannot feel because---</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I know, I know. You have no<br>
    emotions.<br>
    (very intrigued)<br>
    What I mean is, what's going on<br>
    in there?<br>
    (points at his head)<br>
    What did it make you think about?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I was... intrigued. Jenna seemed<br>
    to be displaying genuine affection<br>
    toward me.</p>

  <p> GUINAN<br>
    And then?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I calculated that Jenna's actions<br>
    to date would tend to support the<br>
    supposition that she wishes to<br>
    initiate a non-platonic mutually<br>
    exclusive relationship.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You're just a starry-eyed<br>
    romantic, aren't you?<br>
    (before he can answer)<br>
    What do you think of her?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I find her to be a competent<br>
    officer... highly motivated...<br>
    lacking somewhat in her<br>
    understanding of the theory<br>
    underlying dilithium matrix<br>
    applications---</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    But what do you think of her<br>
    personally?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Do you like her?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have become... used to her.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    It sounds like the next step is<br>
    up to you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    So what are you gonna do about<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not know. Clearly, an<br>
    ongoing intimate relationship is<br>
    an option. However, I am<br>
    inexperienced in such matters.<br>
    I require advice.</p>

    Well, don't look at me.</p>
  <p> Data obligingly looks away from her.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    No, no. I mean, this time I don't<br>
    have any advice to give. You<br>
    can't tell someone how to handle<br>
    their first love affair. They have<br>
    to find a way to do that<br>
    themselves.</p>

    jump into another relationship<br>
    --</p>
  <p> From the confused look on Data's face, Geordi can tell<br>
    this isn't helping much, but he keeps going.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... see, that can be a problem...<br>
    unless, of course, she is ready...<br>
    and then it depends if you're<br>
    really serious. It's uh... kind<br>

    Data, when you get involved with<br>

    getting hurt.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I cannot get hurt. But she can.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Jenna knows that. And she's<br>

    So am I, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> Worf aims the tricorder at the objects and takes a<br>
    quick reading.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, the only detectable<br>
    bioelectric residuals are your<br>
    own.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    You did not --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    -- No. I did not.</p>
  <p> Worf scowls. He quickly checks the bathroom.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It seems we have a poltergeist.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A mischievous spirit.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - REV. 4/2/91 - ACT THREE 29.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>

    Hoq-JoH.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Perhaps this is some kind of<br>
    practical joke.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (taken aback)<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps not.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I cannot explain how an intruder<br>
    could have entered this room...<br>
    I recommend we go to Red Alert.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not yet.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Then I will order one of my<br>
    officers to stand watch.<br>
    (keys insignia)<br>
    Worf to Ensign --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (cutting him off)<br>
    -- That's alright, Mister Worf.<br>
    For now, I think circumstances<br>
    warrant our caution -- nothing<br>
    more.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - REV. 4/2/91 - ACT THREE 30-32. </p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (reluctantly)<br>
    As you wish, Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard dismisses him with a nod, and Worf turns and<br>
    goes out the door. Picard stares again at the objects<br>
    beneath the desk. OFF his still puzzled face.</p>

  <p>36 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Data is painting at an easel. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Enter.</p>
  <p> He stops painting and turns toward the door as Jenna<br>
    steps inside, carrying an object in both her hands.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    I know it's a little unexpected...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - REV. 3/28/91 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are correct. I did not<br>
    anticipate your arrival until<br>
    nineteen hundred hours.</p>
  <p> Data stays at the easel, continues to paint.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    I couldn't wait... I wanted you<br>
    to have this.</p>
  <p> She holds the object out to Data -- it is a small<br>
    alien sculpture, exotic and beautiful. He studies it,<br>
    but does not take it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You have often expressed<br>
    dissatisfaction with the Spartan<br>
    nature of my quarters. Is this<br>
    an attempt at embellishment?</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    The cat's out of the bag.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (looking around)<br>
    Spot?</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    I mean you've caught me in the<br>
    act. I'm just trying to brighten<br>
    things up around here.<br>
    (re: the sculpture)<br>
    It's Tyrinean. What do you think?</p>
  <p> Data studies the object for a moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Its line is both fluid and formal,<br>
    yet retains an unpremeditated<br>
    quality. The tactility of the<br>
    surface enrichment is evocative<br>
    of the neo-primitive period in<br>
    Tyrinean blade carving.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    I hadn't thought of it that way.</p>
  <p> Jenna looks at Data, still seated at his easel.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - REV. 3/27/91 - ACT THREE 33A.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    (re: painting)<br>
    I'm sorry. Don't let me<br>
    interrupt.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Alright.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - REV. 3/28/91 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Then he turns back and continues painting. If it was<br>
    anybody else, the action would be the height of<br>
    rudeness. Jenna can't help but react a moment, even<br>
    though she knows he doesn't intend a slight. She<br>
    recovers.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    (playfully)<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (looks up)<br>
    Yes?</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    The Book of Love, chapter four,<br>
    paragraph seventeen: When your<br>
    girlfriend arrives with a gift,<br>
    stop whatever it is you're doing,<br>
    and give her your undivided<br>
    attention.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My literature search was<br>
    apparently incomplete. I<br>
    discovered twenty-nine books with<br>
    that title, but none contained<br>
    that particular admonition.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    (playful)<br>
    That's because we're writing our<br>
    own version as we go -- you and<br>
    I.</p>
  <p> A long beat as Data thinks about this. He sets down<br>
    his paintbrush.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I should not have resumed my<br>
    painting?</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Despite your suggestion that I<br>
    continue?</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    Exactly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - REV. 4/2/91 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Another thoughtful beat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The nature of our interactions<br>
    is considerably more subtle and<br>
    complex than I had anticipated.<br>
    I have much to learn.</p>
  <p> A beat as Jenna gets an idea.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    Let's start with this.</p>
  <p> She hands him back the sculpture.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    A critical analysis isn't<br>
    necessarily the best response to<br>
    a gift.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps if I looked for a suitable<br>
    place to display it.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    (pleased)<br>
    Much better.</p>
  <p> Data stands and walks with the carving to a remote<br>
    corner of the room, placing it onto a bare surface.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The ambient light in this location<br>
    accentuates its contours.</p>
  <p> Data observes Jenna's neutral response. Then thinks<br>
    for a beat. He returns to a much more central table.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - REV. 4/2/91 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    However, a gift should not<br>
    necessarily be placed according<br>
    to aesthetic criteria. A more<br>
    central location will carry added<br>
    meaning.</p>
  <p> He places the carving in the more noticeable location.<br>
    Jenna steps over to him, takes his hand.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    Data, what's important is that<br>
    you're trying. You don't know<br>
    how much that means to me.</p>
  <p> She indicates the easel.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Now, go back to your painting.</p>
  <p> Data starts to go back to the easel... hesitates, looks<br>
    at her.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    This time I really mean it.<br>
    (kisses him on cheek)<br>
    I'll see you tonight.</p>
  <p> FOLLOW Jenna as she goes out the door, smile on her<br>
    face.</p>
  <p>37 INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Jenna walks out of Data's quarters and the door closes<br>
    behind her. She takes a few steps, still smiling, then<br>
    pauses a moment. The smile fades for just an instant,<br>
    replaced by the hint of a doubt about this situation.<br>
    She walks back into her room... as a wall panel on<br>
    the corridor bulkhead DEMATERIALIZES, briefly showing<br>
    the wiring within.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, are you picking up anything?</p>

    frazzled.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Hi, honey, I am home.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    Hi.</p>
  <p> He kisses her on the check. She reacts a moment to<br>
    his manner -- they aren't living together, and Data's<br>
    home from work attitude is a bit odd. But she brushes<br>
    it off.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    Any luck at your end?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Negative. We performed a full<br>
    systems diagnostic and found no<br>
    malfunctions.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    We did a full security sweep.<br>
    Nothing.</p>

    drops them on the floor. There are several other pairs<br>

    Well, yes. I think I'll have...<br>

  <p> The replictor produces the drinks; he carries them to<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

  <p> He gives her a drink and she starts too sip. But he<br>
    stops her arm, indicates that they should toast. He<br>

  <p> He touches her glass with his, and then takes a drink.<br>
    So does Jenna, though she eyes him a bit warily. This<br>
    is feeling really strange...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Now... you must relax. Put your<br>
    feet up. I will take care of<br>
    everything.</p>
  <p> He rises and begins to straighten things in the<br>
    perpetual clutter of Jenna's quarters. He picks up the<br>
    shoes which have collected on the floor.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I could organize your closets.<br>
    I have found that by grouping<br>
    apparel first by function, and<br>
    then by color from light to dark,<br>
    one can more easily locate one's<br>

    In my study of interpersonal<br>

  <p>57 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Worf and Geordi are sitting at the<br>
    table. The atmosphere is one of grave concern. Data<br>
    is standing next to an Okudagram displayed on the wall<br>
    MONITOR.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    During the series of events, I<br>
    was able to measure the W particle<br>
    inference which confirms one of<br>
    my hypotheses.</p>
  <p> Data indicates the Okudagram, which shows &quot;lines&quot; of<br>
    normal space interrupted by pockets or deformations<br>
    of varying sizes and shapes. A graphic depiction of<br>
    the Enterprise is in the midst of it all.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The unusual preponderance of dark<br>
    matter in this nebula is causing<br>
    small gaps in the fabric of normal<br>
    space.</p>
  <p> He points from one &quot;pocket&quot; to another.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    As the Enterprise moves through<br>
    the nebula, it collides with these<br>
    deformations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Like a carriage bouncing over a<br>
    series of potholes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is an apt analogy.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So every time we hit one, part<br>
    of the ship momentarily phases<br>
    out of normal space.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    The question now is, how do we<br>
    get out? Mister Data, can you<br>
    reconfigure the sensors to detect<br>
    these anomalies?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir, but they can only be<br>
    perceived at extremely close<br>
    range. Even at minimal speed,<br>
    it would be impossible to maneuver<br>
    the Enterprise quickly enough to<br>
    avoid them.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A shuttlecraft is more<br>
    maneuverable...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He's right.</p>
  <p> Riker moves to the monitor, points to the Enterprise<br>
    and a position far ahead of it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If we positioned a shuttle far<br>
    enough in front of the<br>
    Enterprise... it could detect the<br>
    pockets and provide us enough<br>
    time to maneuver out of the way.</p>

    We could give the shuttle control<br>

    Sir, the shuttle's inertial<br>

  <p> Riker and the others react to a tiny explosion far out<br>

  <p> Data is preparing two place settings for an intimate<br>
    dinner. His cat passes by. The door CHIMES.</p>

    Enter.</p>
  <p> The door opens and Jenna ENTERS the room, crosses<br>
    toward Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Hello.</p>
  <p> Jenna gives him a peck on the cheek. Her smile is a<br>
    little weak.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    Hi.</p>
  <p> She notices several potted plants and a couple of<br>
    antique Japanese style hanging lanterns.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The place looks great.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you. It is much less<br>
    Spartan, is it not?</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    Much less... It looks... great...<br>
    it really does... it looks great.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Jenna, you are repeating yourself.<br>
    I have found this to be indicative<br>
    of mental distraction. Is that<br>
    a correct assumption in this<br>
    instance?</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    I'm afraid it is.</p>
  <p> Data moves toward the replicator.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then perhaps we should begin our<br>
    meal. Among humans, a low serum<br>
    glucose level is often responsible<br>
    for --</p>

  <p> Data pauses.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Let's talk... first.</p>
  <p> She indicates his chair at the table. Data comes back,<br>
    sits down. She sits opposite him.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm not sure how to begin.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What is the subject?</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    You and me. Our relationship.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes?</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    (deep breath)<br>
    Data, sometimes people blindly<br>
    make the same mistake again and<br>
    again. Until it finally happens<br>
    in a way so obvious and so<br>
    blatant, that they can no longer<br>
    deny what they've been doing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Are you currently experiencing<br>
    this phenomenon?</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    I didn't see it until today. I<br>
    got out of a relationship with<br>
    an unemotional man. And went<br>
    right back into another with a<br>
    man who is absolutely incapable<br>
    of emotion.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There does appear to be a<br>
    recurring motif.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    You were so kind and attentive.<br>
    I thought maybe that would be<br>
    enough.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;In Theory&quot; - REV. 3/27/91 - ACT FIVE 63.</p>
  <p>92 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is not?</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    No, it's not. Because as close<br>
    as we are, I don't really matter<br>
    to you. Not really. Nothing I<br>
    could do or say will ever make<br>
    you happy, or hurt you, or touch<br>
    you in any way.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is... a valid projection.</p>
  <p> Data thinks for a moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It is apparent that my reach has<br>
    exceeded my grasp in this<br>
    particular area. I am perhaps<br>
    not nearly so human as I aspire<br>
    to become...</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing, pleasantly)<br>
    If you are ready to eat, I will<br>
    bring our meal.</p>
  <p> Data stands. Jenna looks at him sadly for a beat --<br>
    this is just what she was talking about.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    No. That's alright.</p>
  <p> She stands.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'd better go, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If you wish.</p>
  <p> Jenna reaches over and kisses him on the cheek. Starts<br>
    to turn toward the door.</p>

    Jenna. Are we no longer... a<br>
    couple?</p>
  <p> Her eyes suddenly fill with tears.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    No... we're not.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then I will delete the<br>
    appropriate program.</p>
  <p> JENNA<br>
    (quickly toward the<br>
    door)<br>
    I'll see you later...</p>
  <p> She goes out the door -- it closes behind her. Data<br>
    watches for a moment. The cat suddenly jumps up on his<br>
    lap.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Hello, Spot.</p>
  <p> He reaches down to pet it, and the animal nuzzles up to<br>
    his hand.</p>
