  <p>2 INT. TROI'S OFFICE - CLOSE ON</p>
  <p> ENSIGN JANET BROOKS, mid-thirties, trying to show<br>
    confidence.</p>
  <p> BROOKS<br>
    It's been five months since Marc's<br>
    accident. I haven't missed a<br>
    single hour of my duties. I've<br>
    volunteered for extra time in the<br>
    nursery. My language studies are<br>
    better than they've ever been.<br>
    Someone else might have given in<br>
    -- but I didn't.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    &quot;Given in&quot; to what?</p>
  <p> Brooks shrugs.</p>
  <p> BROOKS<br>
    Death is a normal part of life.<br>
    Maybe some of us are better at<br>
    facing that than others.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (gently)<br>
    Or maybe some of us aren't really<br>
    facing it at all.</p>
  <p> Some of Brooks' composure cracks, but she does her best<br>
    to pull it back.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Sometimes, we suffer more than<br>
    our suffering requires.</p>
  <p> BROOKS<br>
    What do you mean?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Loss&quot; - REV. 10/10/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Recovery from a great loss<br>
    involves a great deal of pain.<br>
    If we try to avoid that pain we<br>
    only make it harder on ourselves<br>
    in the long run.</p>
  <p> BROOKS<br>
    But I feel fine.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Then why did you come to see me?</p>
  <p> BROOKS<br>
    (exasperated)<br>
    I told you. I just wanted to...<br>
    check in.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Today would have been your<br>
    husband's thirty-eighth birthday.</p>
  <p> BROOKS<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    You keep excellent records,<br>
    Deanna.</p>
  <p> Troi studies her, gives her room to continue...</p>
  <p> BROOKS<br>
    Last night. I dreamt Marc was<br>
    with me, celebrating. I held him.<br>
    I was so glad this nonsense was<br>
    finally over. Then I woke up --<br>
    Alone. And I knew he was dead.<br>
    For the first time, I knew it...</p>
  <p> She's holding herself, like she even wants to cry, but<br>
    she still can't quite allow it to happen.</p>
  <p> BROOKS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I looked everywhere for something<br>
    that belonged to him -- anything.<br>
    (shakes her head)<br>
    I forgot that after the funeral<br>
    I told them to take it all away.</p>
  <p> She looks at Troi sadly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Loss&quot; - REV. 10/10/90 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BROOKS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You were there, Deanna. What in<br>
    the world was I thinking?</p>
  <p> Troi takes a small music box out of a drawer, and moves<br>
    over to Janet.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    They didn't take everything away.</p>
  <p> Troi hands her the box and she opens it... and it<br>
    starts playing music... The sound of it pushes Janet<br>
    over the hump. She begins to sob.</p>
  <p> BROOKS<br>
    (softly)<br>
    How did you know... ? How did you<br>
    know... ?</p>
  <p> Troi just holds her, letting her finally begin to<br>
    mourn.</p>
  <p>3 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD, DATA, RIKER, WORF at their positions. ENSIGN<br>
    ALLENBY is at Conn.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (rising)<br>
    ... An ancient trail along the<br>
    Kabul River in the Himalayas...<br>
    it's a wonderful program...<br>
    Will, it'll do you good to get<br>
    a little fresh Holodeck air...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thanks anyway, but my horsemanship<br>
    is a little too rusty to take<br>
    on the Himalayas.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (teasing)<br>
    Nonsense. We'll program an<br>
    appropriately docile steed for<br>
    you and...</p>

  <p> Confused, Worf continues to check the instruments.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of what, Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    It's gone. But something did<br>
    appear to be directly in our<br>
    path.</p>
  <p> ALLENBY<br>
    Deflector shields are not<br>
    encountering elevated levels of<br>
    interstellar matter...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A sensor echo, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Uncertain... I have no unusual<br>
    readings, Commander.</p>
  <p> Everyone reacts.</p>
  <p>4 INT. TROI'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Troi and Brooks are saying goodbye at Troi's office<br>
    door. Brooks looks as though she's had a long cry, but<br>
    it's done for now. Troi suddenly appears a bit dizzy,<br>
    gasps lightly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Loss&quot; - REV. 10/10/90 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BROOKS<br>
    I promise I'll come by to see you<br>
    tomorrow.<br>
    (noticing dizziness)<br>
    Deanna, are you alright?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (disoriented)<br>
    What... ?</p>
  <p> BROOKS<br>
    You faded out there for a second.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, I'm okay. Very... tired,<br>
    that's all.</p>
  <p> BROOKS<br>
    You're sure?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes... Will I see you tomorrow?</p>
  <p> Brooks is a little puzzled since she just agreed to<br>
    that moments ago.</p>
  <p> BROOKS<br>
    Tomorrow. Thank you, Deanna.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> Brooks leaves. Troi takes a deep breath, leans for<br>
    a moment against the doorway to regain some balance.</p>
  <p> INTERCUTTING:</p>

  <p> who suddenly notices something on his own panel.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    An aggregate field of<br>

  <p>8 INT. TROI'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Troi is even more disoriented and dizzy, having trouble<br>
    focusing her eyes. She knocks a vase to the floor.<br>
    It shatters.</p>
  <p>8A INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Recommend we run a diagnostic on<br>
    the forward sensor array. We<br>
    don't want a ghost tailing us all<br>
    the way to T'lli Beta.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I'm not convinced it is a ghost,<br>
    Commander. There may be something<br>
    there...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign Allenby, full stop. We'll<br>
    investigate both possibilities.</p>
  <p> ALLENBY<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Allenby complies.</p>
  <p>8B INT. TROI'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Troi tries to reach a couch, doesn't get that far.<br>

    can't make up for months of<br>
    pretending.</p>
  <p> BROOKS<br>

    No. You're wrong. I feel better<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They have length and width, but<br>
    no height. Virtually flat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is why the ship's forward<br>

    So how do we get out of it?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We've processed the limited<br>
    information from the probe... best<br>
    idea for now is to try a<br>
    controlled overload of the warp<br>
    drive... jump directly to warp<br>
    six. The laws of a<br>

    it should work. Not so sure about<br>

    Deanna, I have been fortunate in<br>

    he touches her, she will crumble. Much is said in the<br>
    silence and finally he wraps his arms around her and<br>
    holds her... and with the physical contact, she sobs<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Janet, I've resigned as ship's<br>

  <p> BROOKS<br>
    But why?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

    Well, I think it was fairly clear<br>

    it was obviously non-productive<br>

    Non-productive. I don't<br>

  <p> BROOKS<br>
    Deanna, you were right about me.<br>
    I had to go back and look at what<br>
    I was doing, why I was trying to<br>
    convince myself and you that I<br>
    was a &quot;new woman&quot;... and I<br>
    realized I was doing the same<br>
    thing to myself all over again...<br>

    I have to accept that... it's<br>
    really just beginning for me, isn't<br>
    it...</p>
  <p> A long beat as Troi takes it in.</p>
  <p> BROOKS<br>
    So, as far as I'm concerned, it<br>

    Sit down, please.</p>
  <p> She does so.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Our situation has become critical.<br>
    The cluster is still completely<br>

    the cosmic string fragment.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How much time do we have?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Less than five hours. That's why<br>
    I've called you.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    All that remains is the<br>

    There might be some way to warn<br>
    them of their impending<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    I thought Data already tried to<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    He has tried every technical means<br>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental. If<br>
    our speed and course remain<br>
    unchanged, in one hour, the<br>
    Enterprise will be torn apart by<br>
    the gravitational forces of the<br>
    cosmic string fragment.</p>
  <p>72 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data is briefing Troi in front of a screen. A series<br>
    of still frames of the previous probe image of the<br>
    creatures appears on the screen throughout the scene.<br>
    Troi appears hesitant, not confident of her role.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Are your signals reaching them<br>
    at all?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Possibly. However, the beings<br>
    may perceive them as negligible<br>
    noise rather than an attempt at<br>
    communication.</p>
  <p> Data appears to be awaiting her next question. Troi's<br>
    not sure how to proceed.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Is there any evidence at all that<br>
    they're sentient?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Negative. The nature of their<br>
    movement suggests a simple order<br>
    of intelligence.</p>
  <p> Troi takes a deep breath... doesn't know what to do,<br>
    what to say, why is she here?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Loss&quot; - REV. 10/11/90 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Data, what if they're simply<br>

    inherent, inborn forces that<br>
    drive every species. What they<br>
    need. What they fear.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We've got to discover what drives<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not believe there is any way<br>
    to know for certain, Counselor.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We can speculate based on the<br>
    available evidence...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The only evidence we have at<br>
    present is the brief interruption<br>
    in their movement pattern during<br>
    our last attempt to break away...</p>

  <p>72 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (mind working)<br>
    Which may suggest some kind of<br>
    awareness of our presence...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Otherwise their course and speed<br>
    have been constant.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    On a straight line to the cosmic<br>
    string...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You're convinced the string's<br>
    gravitation is pulling them in.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Since the cluster is<br>
    two-dimensional, I have no direct<br>
    evidence to support that<br>
    assumption. But it is the most<br>
    reasonable hypothesis.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is unlikely they would<br>
    intentionally move toward a<br>
    destructive force...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Moths fly toward a flame. Horses<br>
    sometimes run into a burning barn.<br>
    Data, don't you see, we've been<br>
    thinking in three-dimensions.<br>
    We have to get two-dimensional.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Pardon me?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Subspace signals, photon<br>
    torpedoes, nothing's had an<br>
    impact... it is reasonable to<br>
    wonder if a gravitational pull...<br>
    even as strong as a cosmic<br>
    string's... would affect them.</p>

  <p>72 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What if they've chosen a course<br>
    to the cosmic string? A case of<br>
    pure stimulus-response. Driven<br>
    by instinct... just like the moth<br>
    to a flame...</p>
  <p> Off Data's reaction...</p>
  <p>72A INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data and Troi have brought their ideas to Picard.<br>
    Riker, Worf, Geordi, Allenby are present.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If Counselor Troi's supposition<br>
    is correct, Captain... a replica<br>
    of the string projected behind<br>
    the cluster could induce them to<br>
    reverse course. Disrupting the<br>
    graviton wake long enough for<br>
    us to escape.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How do you simulate a cosmic<br>
    string? It has the gravitational<br>
    force of a hundred stars.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not suggest we simulate the<br>
    gravitational field of the string<br>
    fragment, Commander. Rather the<br>
    string's vibration.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Vibration. This isn't a violin,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data's right. The principle is<br>
    the same. A cosmic string<br>
    emanates a characteristic set of<br>
    subspace frequencies as atomic<br>
    particles decay along its event<br>
    horizon. I could use the ship's<br>
    parabolic dish to amplify and<br>
    reflect those frequencies back<br>
    toward the cluster. The<br>
    Enterprise itself would echo the<br>
    cosmic string.</p>
