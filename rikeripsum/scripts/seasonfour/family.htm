    &quot;Family&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - SPACEDOCK IN ORBIT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Spacedock in orbit around Earth. As Picard records<br>
    his log, there is a subtle hint of finality in his<br>
    voice and tone... a feeling that he's wrapping things<br>
    up here.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log: Stardate 44009.3</p>
  <p>2 EXT. SPACEDOCK - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Revealing the Enterprise being worked on at the dock.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The Enterprise remains docked at<br>
    McKinley Station, undergoing a<br>
    major overhaul and refit. I am<br>
    confident that the ship... and<br>
    crew... will soon be ready to<br>
    return to service.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>3 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> RIKER is looking over a lot of reports and padds on<br>
    the desk. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> The door OPENS and WORF ENTERS.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Phaser upgrades are complete,<br>
    Commander...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Already?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Family&quot; - 8/2/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    We have begun power supply<br>
    calibration.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're just too damned efficient,<br>
    Lieutenant...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Thank-you, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    At this rate, the refit will be<br>
    done a week early and you and I<br>
    might even be forced to get in<br>
    some R&amp;R before we leave Earth...</p>
  <p> Worf doesn't crack a smile... Riker gives it up..</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Proceed with the testing, Mister<br>
    Worf...<br>
    (hands him a padd)<br>
    Here's the final schedule for<br>
    shore leave and personnel<br>
    transfers. By the way, I'm<br>
    looking forward to meeting your<br>
    parents.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They're on the visitors' list...</p>
  <p> Worf looks over the padd, finds their names... it's<br>
    a surprise and not a pleasant one.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You didn't know?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No, sir.<br>
    (beat as he struggles<br>
    with answer)<br>
    It is... inappropriate for a<br>
    Klingon to receive his family<br>
    while on duty. As humans, my<br>
    parents do not understand.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Family&quot; - 8/2/90 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Riker looks at him, frowns, c'mon loosen up...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well, I'm not sure I would either,<br>
    Worf... since this isn't a Klingon<br>
    ship. If you don't want to see<br>
    your parents, that's your<br>
    business... but we don't get to<br>
    Earth all that often.</p>
  <p> Worf frowns. Trying to help --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sure we can arrange for you<br>
    to have more off-duty time while<br>
    they're here.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (too quickly)<br>
    No... sir. That will not be<br>
    necessary.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Dismissed.</p>
  <p> Worf turns to leave... Riker has a second thought...<br>
    on a more personal level --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf, if you're worried they might<br>
    learn about what happened on the<br>
    Klingon planet...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Not at all, sir. I have already<br>
    informed them in correspondence<br>
    of my discommendation. I do not<br>
    believe any human can truly<br>
    understand my dishonor.</p>
  <p> Worf EXITS without waiting for a reaction. A beat as<br>
    Riker thinks about it... and</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>4 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> PICARD, in civilian clothes, is putting a few<br>
    belongings into a small rucksack.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Family&quot; - REV. 8/8/90 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The bandages have been removed from his face and he<br>
    looks fully recovered from his Borg experience. TROI<br>
    is with him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (responding)<br>
    France. Labarre, my home<br>
    village...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Really...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    First time in almost twenty<br>
    years...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Interesting.</p>
  <p> Picard recognizes a therapeutic reaction when he hears<br>
    it...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (Don't... )<br>
    Counselor...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I just find it interesting... <br>
    that Captain Jean-Luc Picard... <br>
    the man who couldn't be pried out<br>
    of his seat for a vacation for<br>
    three years...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's Earth... it's home... do I<br>
    need another reason?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't know. What do you think?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor, your help has been<br>
    invaluable during my recovery.<br>
    I'm better... the injuries have<br>
    healed...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Those you can see in a mirror.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Family&quot; - REV. 8/6/90 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (insisting)<br>
    The nightmares have ended. All<br>
    I need is a little time to myself.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I agree. In fact, I'm delighted<br>
    you're going. But perhaps the<br>
    choice of where you're going could<br>
    stand some scrutiny.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you wish to believe my going<br>
    home is a direct result of<br>
    being held captive by the Borg,<br>
    be my guest...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Is that what you believe?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hate it when you do that.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (with great compassion)<br>
    Captain, you do need time. You<br>
    cannot achieve complete recovery<br>
    so quickly. Don't expect so much<br>
    of yourself. It is perfectly<br>
    normal, after what you've been<br>
    through, to spend a great deal<br>
    of time trying to find... yourself<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (softly, finishing the<br>
    thought)<br>
    And what better place to find<br>
    oneself than on the streets of<br>
    one's home village.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (nods, smiles)<br>
    Interesting.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Have a good trip.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Family&quot; - 8/2/90 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> She EXITS. Picard picks up his rucksack and moves for<br>
    the door. He pauses on the threshold and takes a long<br>
    look around the cabin... could this be a last look?<br>
    Picard EXITS.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Family&quot; - 8/2/90 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE DOCK (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise still docked.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>6 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN is working on the console as Worf ENTERS.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They still have not signalled?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Nossir.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (growls)<br>
    My mother is never on time. It<br>
    is so... human... of her.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (grins)<br>
    Well, you know women.</p>
  <p> And there's a moment as Worf stares at him a beat... <br>
    and this throwaway comment hangs in the air between<br>
    the odd couple of O'Brien and Worf who may each know<br>
    women but unlikely in the same way.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am not looking forward to<br>
    this... I wish they would come<br>
    so it would begin and end sooner.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I know what you mean, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Unlikely.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Last time my old man came on board<br>
    I found him chasing Nurse Stanton<br>
    around a biobed in Sickbay...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Family&quot; - 8/2/90 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am not concerned about my father<br>
    chasing nurses.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Yeah, but it's always something<br>
    with parents, isn't it, sir...</p>
  <p> FEMALE COM VOICE<br>
    Enterprise, this is Earth Station<br>
    Bobruisk. Two to transport<br>
    aboard.</p>
  <p> O'Brien glances at Worf...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What are you waiting for?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Acknowledged, Bobruisk.<br>
    Energizing.</p>
  <p> SERGEY &amp; HELENA ROZHENKO MATERIALIZE on the platform.<br>
    They are of Russian descent, and carry themselves with<br>
    pride and dignity. Sergey is compact,<br>
    barrel-chested... a retired Starfleet Chief growing<br>
    old gracefully. His wife is short of stature and yet<br>
    there is an underlying strength to her which belies her<br>
    slight appearance.</p>
  <p>7 ANGLE - WORF</p>
  <p> sees them... and in this moment of reunion, there is<br>
    nothing short of love in his face. Even he cannot<br>
    suppress it... and there is even, god forbid, a smile<br>
    that grows on his face.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Hello, mother... father.</p>
  <p> They come off the platform and smile at the sight of<br>
    Worf.</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    Worf!...</p>
  <p> Helena beams and unabashedly hugs him and reaches up<br>
    to kiss his cheek... Worf stiffens, glances at O'Brien<br>
    out of the corner of his eye... reluctantly leans down<br>
    to accept the kiss...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Family&quot; - REV. 8/8/90 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SERGEY<br>
    You look good, son.</p>
  <p> They shake hands.</p>
  <p> SERGEY<br>
    Put on a little weight, didn't<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> SERGEY<br>
    Sure you have. Looks good on you.<br>
    Still working out with those<br>
    Holodeck monsters I bet...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Let me take you to...</p>
  <p> Sergey is already moving to O'Brien... friendly,<br>
    outgoing --</p>
  <p> SERGEY<br>
    Always good to meet another chief<br>
    petty officer.<br>
    (sticks out hand)<br>
    Sergey Rozhenko, formerly of the<br>
    U.S.S. Intrepid.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Miles Edward O'Brien. Good to<br>
    meet you, sir.</p>
  <p> SERGEY<br>
    Don't call me &quot;sir&quot;, I used to<br>
    work for a living.</p>
  <p> They both laugh at the old joke. Worf is getting<br>
    increasingly uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    He's joking. The proudest day<br>
    of his life was when Worf earned<br>
    his commission.</p>
  <p> SERGEY<br>
    Chief, can you imagine an old<br>
    enlisted man like me raising a<br>
    boy to be an officer?</p>
  <p> He laughs with O'Brien... Worf wants out.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Family&quot; - REV. 8/6/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I'll show you to your quarters.</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    Come on, Sergey... there's plenty<br>
    of time to chat with the &quot;boys&quot;...<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Your father's so been looking<br>
    forward to this...</p>
  <p> She intimately takes Worf's arm in hers... he stiffens.<br>
    Exiting...</p>
  <p> SERGEY<br>
    I want to see everything... the<br>
    whole ship... I've got all the<br>
    specs and diagrams of the Galaxy-<br>
    class starships at home...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are in the midst of repair.<br>
    I will not be able to give you<br>
    a complete tour.</p>
  <p> SERGEY<br>
    I'm sure if you asked the<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    You agreed not to embarrass him,<br>
    Sergey. Besides, we came to see<br>
    Worf. Not the ship.</p>
  <p> SERGEY<br>
    Fine. Fine. Okay.</p>
  <p> He leads the way out the door. The last thing we hear...</p>
  <p><br>
    HELENA<br>
    (trying to be tactful)<br>
    Your hair's a little longer, isn't<br>
    it, Worf?</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Family&quot; - REV. 8/6/90 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>8 OMITTED</p>
  <p>9 EXT. PATH NEAR HOUSE - DAY</p>
  <p> Picard walking up a dirt path, carrying the rucksack<br>
    seen earlier as he passes by a vineyard. He is looking<br>
    around, drinking in the sights, sounds, and smells of<br>
    his home. He reacts as he hears movement in the<br>
    adjoining field... he stops, looks... the sound stops<br>
    too... he starts up again and the movement follows him.<br>
    He cocks an eyebrow moves to the field...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right... whoever's there...<br>
    I can hear you...</p>
  <p> The face of a seven year old boy (RENE) reveals itself<br>
    from his hiding place. It is a face of pure innocence<br>
    and freckles. A 24th century Opie.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good lord, a highwayman.</p>
  <p> RENE<br>
    A what?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A highwayman is a robber who<br>
    attacks travelers, but to my<br>
    knowledge, none have been reported<br>
    in this vicinity for centuries.</p>
  <p> RENE<br>
    I'm not a robber.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am much relieved, sir.</p>
  <p> Walking together...</p>
  <p> RENE<br>
    I know who you are.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then, you have the advantage.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Family&quot; - REV. 8/9/90 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RENE<br>
    You're my nephew, Jean-Luc. From<br>
    the starship Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then you must be my uncle Rene.</p>
  <p> RENE<br>
    (laughs)<br>
    I'm not your uncle. It's the<br>
    other way around.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Too bad. I rather enjoyed the<br>
    idea.</p>
  <p> RENE<br>
    Why have you been away so long?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, Starfleet keeps me very<br>
    busy...</p>
  <p> RENE<br>
    Father says you don't like it<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure you misunderstood...</p>
  <p> RENE<br>
    No I didn't. He said so.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah well, Robert and I... we...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Perhaps it's time to change all<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> RENE<br>
    You don't seem so... so arrow... <br>
    arrow... you know...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Arrogant...</p>
  <p> RENE<br>
    Yeah... arrogant... you don't seem<br>
    that way to me. What does it mean<br>
    anyway -- &quot;arrogant son-of-a... &quot;</p>

    Let's talk about it later, shall<br>
    we?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Family&quot; - REV. 8/6/90 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>10 EXT. PICARD HOME - DAY</p>
  <p> The house sits adjacent to a small vineyard. The house<br>
    itself is made of stone and wood, and there is a<br>
    noticeable lack of 24th-century design or devices in<br>
    the building and its surroundings. There is an aged<br>
    historical plaque on the side of the house. The<br>
    setting is rural, and looks much like a farmhouse in<br>
    the French countryside would have looked in the 19th<br>
    century. Rene runs down the path, ahead of Picard...</p>
  <p> RENE<br>
    He's here! He's here!</p>
  <p> After a few seconds, MARIE PICARD comes out of the<br>
    house. She is in her mid-forties, and is wearing a<br>
    simple dress. Marie is very happy to see Picard and<br>
    she quickly goes out to him.</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    Jean-Luc!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Marie...</p>
  <p> She gives him a warm hug and kiss and then looks him<br>
    over.</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    It's so good to finally meet you.<br>
    How are you feeling?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Just fine.</p>
  <p> That exchange comes with the slightest tension.</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    Well, Robert and I are delighted<br>
    you've come to stay with us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was just thinking that I really<br>
    might be imposing... I could<br>
    easily stay in the village...</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    I won't hear of it. It's your<br>
    home. It will always be your<br>
    home.</p>
  <p> Picard can't help glancing around at the house and<br>
    grounds.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Family&quot; - REV. 8/8/90 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    Do things look that different?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. In fact, the amazing thing<br>
    is how little it has changed.<br>
    Everything is exactly as I<br>
    remember it... the hills, the<br>
    house, every rock and stone looks<br>
    untouched by the passage of time.</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    Robert's worked hard to keep it<br>
    that way. It's very important<br>
    to him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As it was to our father.</p>
  <p> RENE<br>
    Someday I'm going to be a starship<br>
    captain!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (grins)<br>
    Even you, Uncle... you look so<br>
    much like Robert when he was your<br>
    age...<br>
    (and this is more to<br>
    himself)<br>
    ... I half expect to see myself<br>
    as a boy run out the door to<br>
    play...</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    Robert can't wait to see you...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (dry)<br>
    Yes. Rene already told me.</p>
  <p> Marie reacts, glances at the boy worried what he might<br>
    have said, but Picard makes it okay with an<br>
    understanding grin...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where is he?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Family&quot; - REV. 8/9/90 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>11 EXT. VINEYARD</p>
  <p> ROBERT is between two rows of grapevines, on his hands<br>
    and knees. He is about six to eight years older than<br>
    Picard, and manages to appear dignified even as he<br>
    scrabbles about in the dirt working on the vines with<br>
    his hands. We can see that he devotes the same careful<br>
    attention to detail in his work as his brother does<br>
    on the bridge of his ship. Picard walks down the row<br>
    and stops in front of him. Robert looks up and sees<br>
    Picard, but remains on his knees. There is no<br>
    animosity on his face, but no welcome either, just<br>
    recognition.</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    So, you've arrived all right.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Welcome home, Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard tries very hard to be warm and brotherly and<br>
    anything but arrogant.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hello, Robert.</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Did you shuttle out from the<br>
    village?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No... I decided to walk.<br>
    (long beat)<br>
    I met Marie and Rene.</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Good... good.</p>
  <p> They've run out of things to say very quickly. Picard<br>
    tries his best to take a forward step.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's... good to see you.</p>
  <p> But it comes out as just another pleasantry.</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    (inclines head toward<br>
    house)<br>
    Make yourself at home. You know<br>
    where everything is... we eat at<br>
    eight. I'll be in in a minute.<br>
    I've got to save this poor, sick<br>
    vine.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Family&quot; - REV. 8/6/90 - ACT ONE 16.</p>

  <p> Picard nods as Robert returns to work and after a beat,<br>
    Picard heads back to the house.</p>
  <p>12 NEW ANGLE (MATTE SHOT)</p>
  <p> In the f.g. are fields of vineyards, punctuated by<br>
    small farmhouses that reflect the architecture and<br>
    design of the 19th century rather than that of the 24th<br>
    century. On the horizon is the actual village of<br>
    Labarre, a city whose roots stretch back for over a<br>
    millennium. There is a feeling of old and new living<br>
    side by side... the village itself is quite modern. On<br>
    Picard and Robert as the distance between them<br>
    grows...</p>

  <p>13 INT. BEVERLY'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> BEVERLY is getting a couple of drinks from the food<br>
    replicator. Troi is sitting on the couch.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Will you have a chance to get<br>
    down to the surface?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Maybe. Will and I have been<br>
    talking about going back to Angel<br>
    Falls...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Oh, Venezuela's beautiful...</p>
  <p> Beverly is about to sit down when the door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> A N.D. CREWMAN ENTERS carrying a large, old box.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Oh great! I'll take that.</p>
  <p> She takes the box and the crewman EXITS. Beverly puts<br>
    the box on the table and Troi comes over.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Something from home?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (nods and opens the box)<br>
    I left it here in storage a long<br>
    time ago. After Jack died.<br>
    (takes out an old book)<br>
    Odds and ends mostly...</p>
  <p> Troi picks up the book and reads the title with<br>
    puzzlement.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    &quot;How to Advance Your Career<br>
    through Marriage&quot;?</p>

  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (smiling at memory)<br>
    It's a joke. He sent me that<br>
    while I was still in medical<br>
    school. It was his way of<br>
    proposing.</p>
  <p> They share a small laugh. Beverly continues to dig<br>
    through the box, taking out various small momentos and<br>
    items. She takes out an old-style computer disk, reads<br>
    the label, reacts... and sits down.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's for Wesley... from Jack.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'd forgotten about it... maybe<br>
    I was trying to forget about it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jack recorded a holographic<br>
    message to Wesley just after he<br>
    was born... it was a gift for<br>
    when he grew up. Jack was going<br>
    to make more of them...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He never got the chance.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Are you afraid of what it might<br>
    say?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No... I just don't know if it will<br>
    do more harm than good. He's<br>
    managed to finally deal with his<br>
    father's death, but...</p>
  <p> Troi's attitude is gentle, soothing... she's slipped<br>
    easily from her role as friend into that of Counselor.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Wesley has a lot of questions<br>
    about his father. Things that<br>
    you can't answer for him.<br>

  <p> Several panels are open, some boxes sitting around...<br>
    this is a ship undergoing a major refit and it's a bit<br>

    father tells a story to an enthralled Geordi...</p>
  <p> SERGEY<br>
    ... So we walk into the school... <br>
    and we don't know what to expect.<br>
    Is Worf hurt? Is he in some kind<br>
    of trouble? The door opens and<br>
    we see our little seven-year-<br>
    old... sitting in a chair... and<br>
    glaring across the room at five<br>
    teenage boys.<br>

  <p> Lights are on inside the house.</p>
  <p>17 INT. PICARD DINING ROOM - NIGHT</p>
  <p> The interior of the home should reflect the same<br>
    preference for an earlier time and way of life as does<br>
    the exterior. A single computer terminal is in<br>
    evidence, along with one or two other hi-tech devices,<br>
    but they should accent the fact that the house is a<br>
    warm French country home from the early 19th century<br>
    and just happens to exist in the 24th century. The<br>
    small dining area is adjacent to the living room and<br>
    there are doors to suggest other rooms. The dinner<br>
    table has been set for a meal of onion soup, baguette,<br>
    and wine. Picard, Robert, Marie, and Rene are just<br>
    sitting down. The tone is deceptively cordial.</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    And your friend Louis wants you<br>
    to contact him as soon as you're<br>
    settled...</p>
  <p> Picard smiles at the name and the memories it brings...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is he still trying to raise the<br>
    ocean floor?</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    Oh yes, he's very excited about<br>

    coaxing, that's what he wants,<br>

    No. I don't. I just want... to<br>

    Is this the forty-six?</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Forty-seven.<br>
    (trying to joke)<br>
    Drinking all that artificial --<br>
    what do they call it? Synthehol?<br>
    -- It's spoiled you. You used<br>
    to have a very discriminating<br>
    palate.</p>
  <p> But the remark slightly nettles Picard nevertheless.<br>
    He tries not to sound defensive, but it still comes<br>
    out that way.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not at all. I believe synthehol<br>
    heightens one's appreciation for<br>
    the genuine article.</p>
  <p> They eat.</p>

    Delicious, Marie.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't see that you have to lose<br>
    anything... just by adding a<br>
    convenience...</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    You wouldn't. I say life has<br>
    become too convenient.</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    And this sounds like a very old<br>
    argument.</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    It is.</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    (tongue-in-cheek)<br>
    Fortunately, Jean-Luc, being the<br>
    &quot;greatest chef&quot; in France, I<br>
    enjoy traditional cooking... so<br>
    I don't mind losing the replicator<br>
    argument... especially since I<br>
    used it to get a sonic shower.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was astonished to see it here...</p>

    I don't use it. Never will.</p>

  <p> LOUIS<br>
    You always reach for the future.<br>
    Your brother for the past.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There should be room for both in<br>
    this life.</p>
  <p> A thoughtful beat as they walk on...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And you, old rascal, you've made<br>
    quite a shift toward the future<br>
    yourself...</p>

  <p> LOUIS<br>
    Well, hydroponics turned out to<br>
    be so dull...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (laughs)<br>
    You should have listened to me<br>
    from the beginning.</p>
  <p> LOUIS<br>
    If I had listened to you I never<br>
    would have gone on that cycling<br>
    trip with the Bloom sisters...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And broken your leg!</p>
  <p> LOUIS<br>
    And got married. Twice.</p>
  <p> They laugh.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hear you've been promoted to<br>
    supervisor of the Atlantis<br>
    project...</p>
  <p> LOUIS<br>
    (modestly)<br>
    I'm one of two hundred<br>
    supervisors... although my wife<br>
    would have you believe I run the<br>
    entire project.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's certainly exciting work.<br>
    I've kept up with it in the<br>
    journals...</p>
  <p> LOUIS<br>
    Really?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's only one thing I don't<br>
    understand...<br>
    (off Louis' reaction)<br>
    It's just that you were such a<br>
    desperately poor swimmer...<br>
    thinking of you working on the<br>
    ocean floor...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Family&quot; - REV. 8/6/90 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> LOUIS<br>
    (grins)<br>
    I guess we all find a way to<br>
    confront our greatest fears.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Seriously, how do you plan to<br>
    accelerate the buildup on the<br>
    underside of the mantle without<br>
    increasing stress on the tectonic<br>
    plates?</p>
  <p> LOUIS<br>
    You really have kept up, haven't<br>
    you? The truth is... we don't<br>
    know yet...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Enterprise used harmonic<br>
    resonators to relieve tectonic<br>
    pressures on Drema Four... it's<br>
    obviously not exactly the same<br>
    problem but...</p>
  <p> LOUIS<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    You know, it's a shame...<br>
    (off Picard's look)<br>
    The government's been looking for<br>
    some one to take over the<br>
    project... a real leader who can<br>
    come in and get it moving...<br>
    They're looking for you, Jean-Luc.<br>
    (Picard reacts)<br>
    But I know you'd never leave<br>
    Starfleet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, I'd never leave Starfleet.</p>
  <p> And he said it, but the words come out hollow, without<br>
    conviction. And no one is more surprised than Picard.<br>
    The revelation is extremely disconcerting and Louis<br>
    is sharp enough to catch the subtle shading in Picard's<br>
    voice.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Family&quot; - REV. 8/9/90 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> LOUIS<br>
    That's what I thought.<br>
    (thinks for a second)<br>
    Hey, if nothing else, why don't<br>
    I send over some of the internal<br>
    studies of the tectonic problem...<br>
    since you're interested... We<br>
    could use any thoughts you might<br>
    have...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (beat)<br>
    All right.</p>
  <p> Louis smiles as he realizes that the subject is still<br>
    alive... and anything is possible. They continue<br>
    walking in the vineyard.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>20 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Fewer people around than normal, a feeling of being<br>
    somewhere after normal hours. Worf, Sergey and Helena<br>

  <p> SERGEY<br>
    It's a great crew, Worf... and<br>
    they think the world of you...</p>

    They really do...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Mother, Father... I wish you would<br>
    be a little more... reserved...<br>

    On my way, Commander.<br>
    (to his parents)<br>
    Have Guinan call me if you need<br>

  <p> He EXITS. Helena glances at Sergey -- what do you<br>
    think? Sergey shrugs, worried, but doesn't know.<br>
    (It's the shorthand communication of people who have<br>
    been married a long time.)</p>
  <p> SERGEY<br>
    Maybe we should just leave it<br>
    alone.</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    I can't leave it alone. I'm his<br>

  <p> They look out at the stars.</p>
  <p> GUINAN (O.C.)<br>
    Sooner or later, everyone comes<br>
    in here, stands by the windows...<br>
    stares out into space for a long<br>
    time.</p>
  <p>21 ANGLE</p>
  <p> to reveal Guinan. They look over and smile, hello.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    They all look for that one star,<br>
    the one they call home... doesn't<br>

  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (off their looks)<br>
    How come you never gave him prune<br>
    juice?</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    I beg your pardon?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Worf... he never had prune juice<br>
    until he came in here... now he<br>
    can't get enough of it...</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Worf?</p>
  <p> SERGEY<br>
    He didn't want any human foods<br>
    growing up... everything had to<br>
    be Klingon...</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    I learned to cook rokeg blood<br>
    pie...</p>
  <p> SERGEY<br>
    We never quite learned how to eat<br>
    it though.</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    It was a difficult adolescence.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You ought to write a book.</p>
  <p> SERGEY<br>
    We didn't do anything special.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You don't think so? Look at him<br>
    now... I think that's pretty<br>
    special...</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    We knew it wouldn't be easy for<br>
    him... without other Klingons to<br>
    look to for guidance...</p>

    We let him discover and explore<br>
    his heritage for himself... let<br>
    him find his own path...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    A lot of parents could learn a<br>
    few things from the two of you...</p>
  <p> Helena and Sergey exchange a loving glance.</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    I'm afraid Worf thinks we don't<br>
    understand him...</p>
  <p> SERGEY<br>
    Because we're human, you know,<br>
    not Klingon.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Maybe a part of him believes that.<br>
    But there's another part of him<br>
    I've seen... the part that drinks<br>
    prune juice... and comes here to<br>
    the window... when he looks out<br>
    for home, he doesn't look toward<br>
    the Klingon Empire. He's looking<br>
    toward you.</p>
  <p> Off their reactions...</p>
  <p>22 INT. PICARD LIVING ROOM - DAY</p>
  <p> Picard is sitting at the table, lost in thought. The<br>
    lights are low. The table monitor is on with some<br>
    Okudagrams that Louis sent over about the underwater<br>
    project. He is staring through rather than at it.<br>
    Marie ENTERS carrying some jars and glasses.</p>

  <p> Picard glances up.</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    Are you all right?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Actually... I seem to have made<br>
    a disturbing discovery...</p>
  <p> She looks at him with concern...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Louis mentioned the Atlantis<br>
    project needed a director... and<br>
    I actually found myself thinking<br>
    about it.</p>
  <p> Her face brightens considerably...</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    But that would be wonderful,<br>
    Jean-Luc...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you think so?</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    Having you back home... of<br>
    course...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Marie, I spent my youth doing<br>
    everything I could to get away<br>
    from home...</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    You've been as narrow-minded as<br>
    your brother... and it's time both<br>
    of you began to appreciate each<br>
    other's worlds...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can't argue with that.</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    Given a little time, you might<br>
    even get to like one another.</p>
  <p> Picard grins at her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Family&quot; - 8/2/90 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, I already like his choice<br>
    of wives. I haven't thanked you<br>
    for your correspondence, it made<br>
    me feel like part of the family.</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    You're not like part of the<br>
    family. You are part of the<br>
    family, Jean-Luc Picard.</p>
  <p> He looks at her with appreciation. Robert ENTERS,<br>
    drying his hands with a cloth, just as there is a knock<br>
    at the door. Robert moves to open it... Louis ENTERS.</p>
  <p> LOUIS<br>
    Robert...</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Hello, Louis.</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    Come in, Louis... I'll get you<br>
    some wine...<br>
    (subtle encouragement)<br>
    The two of you can talk<br>
    business...</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Business?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, there's really nothing to<br>
    talk about...</p>
  <p> LOUIS<br>
    I'm interested to know what you<br>
    thought about our plans.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've just really had a chance to<br>
    glance at them... I have a few<br>
    ideas but...</p>
  <p> Robert observes with curiosity...</p>
  <p> LOUIS<br>
    Wonderful. We should discuss them<br>
    with the board of governors...<br>
    I've set up a meeting...</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    A meeting... ?</p>
  <p> LOUIS<br>
    Just a preliminary conversation...<br>
    tomorrow morning...</p>
  <p> Picard begins a slow build... to contain his anger...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Preliminary to what?</p>
  <p> Louis takes a breath... okay, I'm going for it --</p>
  <p> LOUIS<br>
    They want you. I mentioned your<br>
    interest in the project, that's<br>
    all. That's all I had to say.<br>
    They jumped at the prospect...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I never said there was a<br>
    prospect...</p>
  <p> LOUIS<br>
    At least, listen to them,<br>
    Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> Picard goes inside himself and turns away, shakes his<br>
    head, trying to contain whatever is trying to get<br>
    out... inside him is the anger and pain... feeling<br>
    pulled between two worlds again... defeated... he never<br>
    turns back to Louis as he says in his softest voice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Fine. Good. I'll listen to<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> Marie - who misses the full import of this - smiles,<br>
    glances at Robert who is not smiling at all. He<br>
    studies his younger brother.</p>
  <p> LOUIS<br>
    You won't regret it, Jean-Luc.<br>
    I promise you. I'll see you in<br>
    the morning...</p>
  <p> Hold on Picard...</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>26 INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> WESLEY and Beverly sitting together. Beverly is keyed-<br>
    up and trying not to let her feelings show too<br>
    strongly. Beverly holds the disk in her hand, gripping<br>
    it tightly. She is positive, trying to be cheerful,<br>
    but there is an undertone of worry in her voice.<br>
    Wesley is excited.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What kind of message?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't know exactly. Your father<br>
    made it a few weeks after you were<br>
    born.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (hesitates)<br>
    He thought it was important to<br>
    say certain things... to make sure<br>
    that he didn't forget to tell you<br>
    later.</p>
  <p> Wesley stares at the disk in Beverly's hand, eager to<br>
    take it, but afraid to at the same time. He looks back<br>
    at Beverly.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Do you know what it says?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No.<br>
    (smiles and gives him<br>
    disk)<br>
    He wanted you to have this when<br>
    you turned eighteen... and I want<br>
    you to have it too.</p>
  <p> Wesley looks at the disk in his hand for a few seconds,<br>

    Enter.</p>
  <p> Sergey and Helena ENTER...</p>
  <p> SERGEY<br>

    No. I thought you were going to<br>

  <p> HELENA<br>
    We just came by to tuck you in.</p>
  <p> And Worf understands that they're not being literal...<br>
    it's a way of saying &quot;we care.&quot; Worf studies his<br>
    parents, and drops his eyes as he feels more emotion<br>
    than he'd care to admit.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

    of us... but whenever you are<br>
    suffering, you must remember...<br>

  <p> Picard is sitting at the table, drinking wine... he<br>
    is as distressed as we've ever seen him... indeed, if<br>
    this has been a trip to &quot;find himself&quot; as Troi<br>

  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Your... synthenol... never leaves<br>
    you out of control, isn't that<br>
    so...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That is so.</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    (re: the wine in his<br>
    glass)<br>
    This will.</p>
  <p> He drinks. So does Picard.</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Now there's something I'd like<br>
    to see.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's that?</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Jean-Luc Picard out of control.</p>
  <p> Picard looks away, not wanting to spar.</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    I venture you've probably never<br>
    been drunk in your entire life.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have nothing but pity for those<br>
    who abuse any substance.</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    As do I. And yet see how you fill<br>
    your glass </p>
  <p> Picard puts down his glass. Stands and moves away from<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    I'll make it anyway. You've<br>
    changed.<br>
    (off Picard's look)<br>
    What the devil happened to you<br>
    up there?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is that &quot;brotherly&quot; concern?</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    No. I'm just curious what makes<br>
    a man change so much... what did<br>
    they do to you anyway?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You know what happened.</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Not everything... I gather you<br>
    were hurt... humiliated... I<br>
    always said you could use a little<br>
    humiliation or was it humility,<br>
    well, either one...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't want to do this with<br>

  <p>30 EXT. PICARD HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Robert trails Picard... Picard tries to control himself<br>
    throughout the scene... Robert continues to dig at<br>
    him...</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Why walk away? That was never<br>
    your style...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm tired of fighting with you,<br>
    Robert...</p>

  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Pity. Tired...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's right.</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Tired of the Enterprise too.</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't respond.</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Captain Picard, icon of Starfleet,<br>
    falls to Earth, ready to jump in<br>
    the water with Louis. This is<br>
    not the brother I remember...</p>
  <p> Robert waits for a retort, gets none, pushes on...</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    It seemed the ideal situation for<br>
    you -- local boy makes good,<br>
    returns home after twenty years<br>
    for a hero's welcome.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am not a hero...</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Certainly you are... you wouldn't<br>
    settle for anything less... admit<br>
    it, never could, and you never<br>
    did.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That isn't true.</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Of course it is. Turn down a<br>
    parade in your honor? You?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've never sought recognition...</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Never? And what of the school<br>
    president, the valedictorian, the<br>
    athletic hero... arms raised in<br>
    victory...</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Were you so jealous?</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Dammit, I had a right to be.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (scorn)<br>
    A right...</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    I was always your brother...<br>
    watching you get the cheers...<br>
    watching you break every one of<br>
    father's rules and getting away<br>
    with it...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why didn't you break a few rules?</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    I was the older one, the<br>
    responsible one. I had to look<br>
    after you...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You were a bully...</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    It was such a pleasure to bully<br>
    you...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Try it again.</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Did you come back because you<br>
    need me to look after you<br>
    again... ?</p>
  <p> That's about all Picard can take... the rage he's been<br>
    carrying... everything he's felt about the Borg...<br>
    about missions gone awry... about lost crewmen... <br>
    everything he's ever bottled up explodes in the face of<br>
    his brother's verbal assault. He grabs his brother by<br>
    the lapels... and swings at Robert, connecting on his<br>
    jaw... Robert goes flying backwards, crashing into the<br>
    brush.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Family&quot; - REV. 8/20/90 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>30A EXT. VINEYARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Robert pulls himself out of the brush and grabs Picard<br>
    and Picard grabs him and an awkward dance between two<br>
    middle-aged men acting like children ensues... and<br>
    slowly we may come to realize there's a slightly<br>
    humorous edge to this. Robert pulls him to the wet<br>
    ground and they roll over and over in the mud and as<br>
    they make one final roll, they realize they're<br>
    laughing... and the laughter consumes them as they lie<br>
    side-by-side on the ground, as dirty as little kids,<br>
    looking up at the sky.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You were asking for it, you know.</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Yes, but you needed it. You<br>
    have been terribly hard on<br>
    yourself.</p>
  <p> Still with residual laughter, betraying the seriousness<br>
    of the revelations...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You don't know, Robert. You don't<br>
    know. They took everything I was.<br>
    They used me to kill and destroy.<br>
    And I could not stop them. I<br>
    should have been able to stop<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> And he still laughs as tears roll down his cheeks...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I tried... I tried... so hard...<br>
    but I just wasn't strong enough.<br>
    Not good enough. I should have<br>
    been able to stop them. I should<br>
    have been able to...</p>

  <p> His fist strikes the ground. A long beat.</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    So, Jean-Luc Picard is human<br>
    after all.</p>
  <p> A beat. Picard sighs, knows it's true... it doesn't<br>
    seem to help.</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This is going to be with you a<br>
    long time, Jean-Luc. A long time.<br>
    And you have to learn to live<br>
    with that. You have a simple<br>
    choice now -- living with it<br>
    below the sea with Louis or above<br>
    the clouds on your Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at his brother with new warmth... as they<br>
    crawl up to their feet, helping each other...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You know, I think you were right.<br>
    (off Robert's look)<br>
    Maybe I did come back so you'd<br>
    look after me.</p>
  <p> Robert smiles, puts his arm around his brother's<br>
    shoulder and as they walk back toward the house...</p>

    I still don't like you.</p>

    What in the world... ?</p>
  <p>32 ANGLE</p>
  <p> to see Picard and Robert still covered with mud, eating<br>
    cheese and fruit at the table... they look up like<br>
    children caught with their hands in the cookie jar...</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    What happened here?</p>
  <p> And they follow her glance, as do we, to see a trail<br>
    of mud tracked into the house...</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Ah...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's entirely my fault, Marie...</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Yes, you see, he fell... and then<br>
    I fell...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We both fell together...</p>
  <p> Marie comes over and examines the bruise on Robert's<br>
    chin.</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    Have you two been fighting?</p>
  <p> ROBERT<br>
    Fighting? Oh, you mean this.<br>
    There's a perfectly good<br>
    explanation for this...</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    Shame on you both. What would<br>
    your father say if he saw you like<br>
    this?</p>

    He'd probably send us to bed<br>
    without our supper.</p>
  <p> They laugh together. Marie smiles, shakes her head.</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    Well, perhaps it was good to get<br>
    it out of your system.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps it was, Marie. Perhaps<br>
    it was.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'll contact Louis and cancel the<br>

  <p> MARIE<br>
    Already, Jean-Luc?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The ship will be ready to leave<br>
    orbit soon... and I belong on<br>
    board.<br>
    (beat, then to Robert)<br>
    If I ever doubt that again... I<br>
    know where to come.</p>
  <p> Robert smiles slightly and the brothers exchange a<br>
    look.</p>
  <p> MARIE<br>
    You can't leave yet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry. I must.</p>

    You're not leaving until you clean<br>
    up this mess... both of you...</p>

  <p> Near the Holodeck doors. Wes steps back, stands in<br>
    front of the doors. His expression is excited,<br>
    expectant... but there is a trace of apprehension here<br>
    too. He hesitates long enough for us to realize that<br>
    this is a big moment in his life. He clears his<br>
    throat, then in an artificially calm and steady<br>
    voice...</p>

  <p> The doors OPEN and Wes walks inside.</p>
  <p>34 INT. HOLODECK</p>
  <p> Dark except for a brightly lit circle in the center of<br>
    the room. Sitting on a chair in a limited set inside<br>
    this circle of light is the frozen image of Jack<br>
    Crusher. Not the towering figure of legend that Wesley<br>
    (and we) expect to meet... Jack is of medium build,<br>
    about Wesley's height, finely boned, and perhaps most<br>
    shocking is that fact that Jack is about 24 years of<br>
    age. He wears an older Starfleet uniform with<br>
    lieutenant's insignia. His expression and attitude are<br>
    cheerful, confident... a man with his entire future<br>
    ahead of him.</p>
  <p>35 ANGLE - CLOSER</p>
  <p> Wesley studies him... this is not what he expected.<br>
    Jack doesn't look much older than he does. The man<br>
    who was his father is more like a peer than a parent.<br>
    Wesley expected to be awed by what he remembered only<br>
    as a very big man who played with him as a child. As<br>
    Jack speaks, Wesley tries not only to pay attention to<br>
    what is being said, but also to try and get a feeling<br>
    for who he was and what kind of man he might have been.</p>

  <p> JACK<br>
    Hello, Wesley. As I make this<br>
    recording, you're just ten weeks<br>
    old.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I want you to know who I am today.<br>
    You see, this Jack Crusher won't<br>
    exist by the time you're grown<br>
    up... I'll be older, more<br>
    experienced... hopefully a little<br>
    wiser. But this person will be<br>
    gone and I wanted you to know who<br>
    I am now, who your father was when<br>
    you came into this world.<br>
    (thoughtful)<br>
    I see you lying there in your<br>
    crib... and I realize that I don't<br>
    know the first thing about being<br>
    a father. So let me just<br>
    apologize for all the mistakes<br>
    I'm about to make as you grow up.<br>
    (disturbed by the<br>
    thought)<br>
    I hope you don't grow up...<br>
    resenting the fact that I was gone<br>
    so much. That comes with this<br>
    uniform. Right now, I'm waiting<br>
    for an assignment on the U.S.S.<br>
    Stargazer. I don't know if I can<br>
    explain why Starfleet is so<br>
    important to me... maybe you'll<br>
    understand when you get this...<br>
    later on.<br>
    (re: uniform)<br>
    Maybe you'll even want to try one<br>
    of these on.<br>
    (thinks, gives up,<br>
    laughs a little)<br>
    You'll probably be a doctor like<br>
    your mother.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We named you after Richard Wesley<br>
    Crusher, my grandfather, who gave<br>
    me my first flying lesson as a<br>
    boy. You come from a fine<br>
    family... of scholars, explorers,<br>
    artists... your great-great<br>
    grandfather was a painter whose<br>
    work once hung in the Prado...<br>

    We've had a skeleton or two in<br>
    our closet... someday, I'll tell<br>
    you about the Crusher who was a<br>
    horse thief on Nimbus Three...<br>
    but we also had our share of<br>
    family heroes... a Crusher fought<br>
    for the Confederacy at Bull Run.<br>
    One died at Station Salem One.<br>
    It's a proud heritage, Wesley...<br>
    one for you to pass on to your<br>

    You're only a baby... but it's<br>

    all the people I've loved in my<br>
    lifetime... your mother... my<br>
    father and mother... our family.<br>
    I see me in you, too. I can<br>
    feel that you're my son. I don't<br>
    know how to describe it...<br>
    There's this connection, this<br>
    bond... I will always be a part<br>
    of you, Wes...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Well, I hope this made some sense<br>
    to you... I'm not sure it does<br>
    to me. Maybe I'll do better next<br>
    time. I love you, Wesley.</p>
  <p> He smiles, finished.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (gently)<br>
    There's plenty of time for that...<br>
    keep your mind open... you may<br>
