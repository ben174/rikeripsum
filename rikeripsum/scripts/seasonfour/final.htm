    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise travels through space as:</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 44307.3.<br>
    I am preparing to leave by<br>
    shuttlecraft for Pentarus Five,<br>
    where I have been asked to mediate<br>
    a dispute among the salenite<br>
    miners -- a contentious group<br>
    unfortunately prone to violence.</p>
  <p>2 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> PICARD, RIKER, TROI, DATA, WORF, and ENSIGN TESS<br>
    ALLENBY at their positions.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    At the same time, I must deal with<br>
    a situation of a far more personal<br>
    nature.</p>
  <p> WESLEY comes bursting in through the Turbolift door,<br>
    out of breath and a little anxious. Everyone on the<br>
    Bridge looks stern and a little disgruntled with him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign, I summoned you almost ten<br>
    minutes ago!</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir, I know, but I was in<br>
    the middle of an experiment using<br>
    some volatile compounds and I<br>
    couldn't just leave them lying<br>
    out --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Excuses, Mister Crusher?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No, sir, not at all, it was more<br>
    of an explanation --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Final Mission&quot; - REV. 9/28/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Because I assure you that will<br>
    not go over well at Starfleet<br>
    Academy.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I know, sir, but --</p>
  <p> Then it sinks in. He stares at Picard.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    The Academy?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I just got the message from<br>
    Admiral Nsomeka. She expects<br>
    you to report in two weeks.</p>
  <p> There are smiles all around as Wesley, nonplussed,<br>
    realizes what Picard is saying.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A position has opened up in this<br>
    year's class. You'll have to work<br>
    overtime to catch up, but I have<br>
    assured the Commander that you<br>
    will be capable of that. Please<br>
    don't make a liar of me.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Oh, yes sir! I mean -- no, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And as your final mission aboard<br>
    the Enterprise... I'd like you<br>
    to accompany me to Pentarus while<br>
    I try to sort things out with the<br>
    miners.</p>
  <p> Wesley is amazed -- first the Academy, and now an<br>
    expedition with the Captain.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Riker tells me you've been<br>
    studying the effects of outpost<br>
    judiciary decisions on Federation<br>
    Law. What better way to get<br>
    first-hand experience?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Final Mission&quot; - REV. 9/21/90 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, I am picking up a general<br>
    distress signal from Gamelan Five.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p> They all turn toward the view screen.</p>
  <p>3 ANGLE - ON SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> An alien woman, SONGI, appears -- a gentle, sensitive<br>
    creature who speaks with quiet desperation.</p>
  <p> SONGI<br>
    Please... Does anyone read us?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Open channel.<br>
    (to screen)<br>
    I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of<br>
    the Federation Starship<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> SONGI<br>
    Captain... I am Chairman Songi,<br>
    of Gamelan Four. An unidentified<br>
    spacecraft has entered orbit above<br>
    our planet. Radiation levels in<br>
    our atmosphere have increased by<br>
    three thousand percent. We can<br>
    only assume we are under attack<br>
    -- but the ship will not answer<br>
    our hails! We are a peaceful<br>
    planet... we have no ability to<br>
    defend ourselves. Please, can<br>
    you help us?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, are we close enough<br>
    for a scan?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Nossir, we are out of range.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Final Mission&quot; - REV. 9/28/90 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Any other ships near that system?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Negative, Commander.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. Chairman Songi, we<br>
    will proceed immediately to your<br>
    planet.</p>
  <p> SONGI<br>
    Thank you, Captain Picard...</p>
  <p> The screen blinks out. Picard considers logistics.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Riker, take the Enterprise<br>
    and investigate the problem.<br>
    Ensign Crusher and I will proceed<br>
    to Pentarus Five.<br>
    (to Wes)<br>
    The miners have sent a shuttle.<br>
    We'll depart in ten minutes.</p>
  <p> Wes acknowledges, heads for the Turbolift.</p>
  <p>4 INT. SHUTTLEBAY TWO</p>
  <p> GEORDI emerges from the miners' shuttle -- a small,<br>
    ragged vessel that looks like the space equivalent of<br>
    &quot;The African Queen&quot;. Its pilot, DIRGO, is a<br>
    tough-looking humanoid who is weathered and worn enough<br>
    to suggest middle-age. Though his appearance is feral,<br>
    he will emerge as an intelligent, if inflexible, being.</p>
  <p> Ultimately, he is self-serving; Dirgo looks out for<br>
    Dirgo, because he's always had to.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Your maneuvering thrusters are<br>
    rigged in a configuration I<br>
    haven't seen before.</p>
  <p> Dirgo gives him a smug look.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    My own modification. It's more<br>
    efficient. You can study it if<br>
    you want...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Final Mission&quot; - REV. 9/28/90 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> At this point, Picard and Wesley enter.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I've run operational and safety<br>
    inspections, Captain. It checks<br>
    out. I won't make any claims for<br>
    comfort.</p>
  <p> Dirgo approaches Picard, sizing him up as he does.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    Captain Picard... Captain Dirgo,<br>
    of the shuttlecraft &quot;Nenebek&quot;.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah -- Captain. Good to meet you.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (sotto to Geordi)<br>
    &quot;Captain?&quot; Of a mining shuttle?</p>
  <p> But Dirgo hears him, turns instantly to him.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    Yes, Ensign -- Captain. My ship<br>
    isn't pretty, and she isn't big<br>
    -- but we've logged almost ten<br>
    thousand hours together.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It seems a very -- sturdy --<br>
    craft.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    We should go. Will you take Ops,<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll let Ensign Crusher perform<br>
    that task. I need to study up<br>
    on Regalian law.</p>
  <p> Dirgo studies Wesley with obvious disdain as they<br>
    enter.</p>

  <p> The shuttle craft heads toward Regalus.</p>
  <p>6 INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Dirgo eyes Wesley handling the Ops position with some<br>
    surprise.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    You've done this before.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (dryly)<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    (jerking his head toward<br>
    the cabin)<br>
    If your Captain isn't tougher than<br>
    he looks, those miners will tear<br>
    him apart.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Don't worry about Captain Picard<br>
    -- he'll handle them.</p>
  <p> Suddenly they are interrupted by a sudden muffled<br>
    explosion and violent shake of the craft, which then<br>
    settles into a constant vibration. Cabin lights dim;<br>
    control panels flicker.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I've lost navigation --</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    The port thruster quad is gone,<br>
    guidance coupling is severed --<br>
    I can't stabilize her!</p>
  <p> The shuttle bucks and pitches as Dirgo and Wesley<br>
    struggle for control.</p>

  <p>9 INT. MINING SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The shuttle is in chaos. Dirgo wrestles with the<br>
    controls as the ship continues to shudder violently.<br>
    Picard bursts through the door of the cabin.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    The port thruster module blew...</p>
  <p> Picard instantly sits in the Ops position.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    Nenebek to Enterprise...<br>
    emergency... do you read?<br>
    Pentarus station... come in...<br>
    (shakes head)<br>
    Communication is gone --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is your navigational system<br>
    functioning?</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    Negative. Switching to manual.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Estimated position... ?</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    Fifty million kilometers from<br>
    Pentarus Five... we may have to<br>
    put down somewhere else...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Crusher, scan for a class<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>

  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He moves to the panel. The shuttle lurches sharply,<br>
    settles, lurches again.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    We'll lose the main impulse engine<br>
    if I don't throttle it down.</p>
  <p> There is another sharp jolt and the ship shudders.</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'll try, sir -- but this grid<br>

  <p> Dirgo glances at Picard. He's a little defensive.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    I don't have the Federation's<br>
    resources...<br>
    (rising, to Picard)<br>
    Captain... will you take the helm?</p>
  <p> Dirgo goes to Wesley, shoulders him aside; Picard takes<br>
    the conn.</p>

    I'm rerouting the deuterium<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>

    We'll have to manually trip the<br>
    bypass from the main engine to<br>

  <p> Dirgo gives Wesley a sharp look.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    Where'd you learn that?</p>

  <p>12 ON PICARD AND VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The red-brown sphere begins to fill the window.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    We've got power reconfigured,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard's hands are at the controls, skillfully<br>
    maneuvering the craft, which continues its sporadic<br>
    jolts and lurches. Dirgo moves to Ops, checks his<br>
    monitors.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    Hull temperature seven hundred<br>
    degrees --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Beginning braking maneuver.</p>
  <p> The craft goes into a pitch up. Cabin lights flicker<br>
    wildly.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    We're below Mach One! Bypass<br>
    to thrusters now!</p>
  <p> Smoke begins to seep into the cabin; the lights flicker<br>
    and the craft bounces turbulently. Finally, there is<br>
    one moment of a controlled glide... and then impact.<br>
    Sparks arc through the cabin, and then there is<br>
    darkness.</p>
  <p>13 EXT. LAMBDA PAZ - MINUTES LATER - DAY</p>
  <p> A merciless sun beats down on a sere desert of rolling<br>
    sand dunes. The shuttle lies, half buried in sand,<br>
    charred and broken. The hatch has ripped off and we<br>
    see Picard emerge, blinking in the harsh light and then<br>
    turning to help Wesley climb out.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Final Mission&quot; - REV. 9/28/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard is already at work, assessing the situation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's salvage what we can.<br>
    (glancing upward)<br>
    The first thing we'll need is<br>
    shelter from the sun. In this<br>
    heat, the shuttle will act like<br>
    an oven.</p>
  <p> Dirgo emerges from the shuttle, wiping his perspiring<br>
    face.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    All systems are out. Can't get<br>
    a communication channel. Location<br>
    transponder's gone, too.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll have to check the craft for<br>
    something to protect our heads<br>
    and eyes... and Captain, please<br>
    recover your medical supplies...<br>
    food and water rations...</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    (hesitant)<br>
    The medical supplies are all<br>
    right...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But... food and water?</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    A replicator... damaged beyond<br>
    repair.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Surely... you have emergency<br>
    supplies.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    This isn't a starship! I have<br>
    to choose what I carry!</p>
  <p> Picard stares at him, not wanting to believe what the<br>
    man is saying.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you telling me... that we have<br>
    no water?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Final Mission&quot; - REV. 9/28/90 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Dirgo looks away. Picard glances up at the sun, and<br>
    then out across the vast desert. Wesley watches him,<br>
    definitely worried, hoping the Captain can pull some<br>
    miracle. But how will they survive without water?</p>
  <p>14 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE ORBITING GAMELAN IV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship maintains a distant orbit around a large blue<br>
    and green planet. In much closer orbit is an enormous<br>
    space ship with no markings, dark and ominous.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    No sir. Engine reactor elements<br>

    Chairman Songi, this is Commander<br>
    Riker on board the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Songi appears on screen.</p>
  <p> SONGI<br>
    Yes, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It appears you've inherited<br>
    someone else's problem... It's<br>
    an old waste vessel... caught by<br>
    your planet's gravitational pull.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Have your people begun to suffer<br>
    from radiation sickness?</p>
  <p> SONGI<br>
    Not yet. But some areas are<br>
    already detecting dangerous<br>
    levels.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'll do our best to get it out<br>
    of here as quickly as possible.</p>
  <p> SONGI<br>
    Thank you, Commander.</p>
  <p> The screen is wiped.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're going to give that barge<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, the Meltasion Asteroid Belt<br>
    lies between here and the sun.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then we'll have to take it<br>
    ourselves and have our<br>
    deflectors clear a safe path<br>
    through the asteroids.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't like the idea of getting<br>
    close enough to that barge to tow<br>
    it. The radiation levels are so<br>
    high we'd be risking contamination<br>
    of the entire crew.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Got a better idea, Geordi?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We could send over a construction<br>
    module to attach thrusters to it.<br>
    Then we could direct it through<br>
    the asteroid belt from a safe<br>
    distance.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister La Forge, prepare to launch<br>
    the construction module. Let's<br>

    can.</p>
  <p> Geordi heads for the Turbolift to obey the command.</p>

  <p>17 EXT. DESERT ON LAMBDA PAZ - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> The three men have salvaged what they could from the<br>
    cabin of the shuttlecraft. They have fashioned wraps<br>
    to cover their heads and shield their eyes, with flaps<br>
    covering the backs of their necks. Wesley is repairing<br>
    a damaged tricorder. Picard is laying broken strips of<br>
    the metal hull on the sand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Crusher, any luck with that<br>
    tricorder?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I think so, sir. The scanning<br>
    range may be limited, but it's<br>
    better than nothing.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    These were on board, Captain.<br>
    They're working.</p>
  <p> He produces four phasers, similar to early Enterprise<br>
    types. Picard and Wes each take one. Dirgo holsters<br>
    the other two.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Excellent. Now --<br>
    (scanning the distance)<br>
    Our communicators may not be able<br>
    to get a signal through this<br>
    strong a magnetic field... so I've<br>
    fashioned an arrow. If a search<br>
    party finds the wreckage, they'll<br>
    know we've headed for those<br>
    mountains.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    Are you crazy?</p>
  <p> Picard shoots him a quizzical look.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    It's too far away. We'll never<br>
    make it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We can't survive out here in the<br>

    Where there are mountains, there<br>
    is shelter.</p>
  <p> Chastened, Dirgo snorts and bristles.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    You have no right to make the<br>
    decisions! I'm Captain of this<br>
    ship!</p>
  <p> This is too much for Wesley, who stands in front of<br>
    Dirgo.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    If you want to get out of this,<br>
    I suggest you listen. Captain<br>
    Picard is the one who's going to<br>
    keep us alive --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Thank you, Ensign, that's enough.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain Dirgo, you're an able<br>
    pilot and I welcome your input.<br>
    Do you feel there's an alternative<br>
    we're overlooking?</p>
  <p> Dirgo hesitates, looks around, sees the vast sweep of<br>
    empty desert. Then --</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. I suggest a steady<br>
    pace, but not a brisk one. We<br>
    need to ration our energy. Try<br>
    to breathe through your nose, it<br>
    will help prevent dehydration.<br>
    I'll lead... Captain Dirgo, will<br>
    you bring up the rear?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Final Mission&quot; - REV. 9/21/90 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> And he starts off, the others falling into line.<br>
    Wesley scans the desert with the tricorder as they<br>
    march. Dirgo gives himself one last look at his fallen<br>
    ship. He gives it a little salute before turning to<br>
    follow the others.</p>
  <p>18 THE SEARING SUN</p>
  <p> burns in the sky, turning it white with heat.</p>
  <p>19 THE TRIO OF MARCHERS</p>
  <p> slogs across the dunes, sweltering under the glare of<br>
    the merciless sun, struggling to make progress in the<br>
    deep sand. Dirgo stumbles in the shifting sands.<br>
    Wesley spots him, helps him regain his footing. Dirgo<br>
    spits sand from his mouth as Wesley helps brush him<br>
    off.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    And you were worried about how<br>
    tough the Captain is?</p>
  <p> He nods ahead --</p>
  <p>20 PICARD - THEIR POV</p>
  <p> marches at a strong, sturdy pace. He looks like he<br>
    could go on for hours.</p>
  <p>21 WESLEY AND DIRGO</p>
  <p> Wesley smiles, then turns and starts off again. Dirgo<br>
    watches him, then surreptitiously removes a bottle from<br>
    his pocket. It contains a clear liquid; he tips the<br>
    bottle and draws deeply on it. Then he covertly<br>
    replaces it.</p>
  <p>22 ON WESLEY</p>
  <p> looking at the tricorder. He slows, swings the<br>
    instrument from one side to the other, frowning as he<br>
    reads the response. Dirgo catches up to him.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    Did you find water?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Final Mission&quot; - REV. 10/1/90 - ACT ONE 17.</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No... not yet...</p>
  <p> Suddenly Wesley stops, turns and points the tricorder<br>
    behind them, then whips it to the opposite side.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    What are you doing with that?</p>
  <p> Picard turns, hearing them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Crusher?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm not sure, sir... an energy<br>
    reading.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Energy reading? What kind?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Low frequency E-M. It's been<br>
    getting stronger... the closer<br>
    we get to those mountains.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    What are you saying? There's<br>
    something over there? Waiting<br>
    for us?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I don't know what it is. It just<br>
    registers as a repeating energy<br>
    pattern...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign, are you suggesting this<br>
    energy is not naturally occurring?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    The readings could be indicating<br>
    some electromagnetic property in<br>
    the rocks... but I don't think so.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A life form?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Final Mission&quot; - REV. 9/28/90 - ACT ONE 18.</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's possible... the pattern's<br>
    fairly organized...</p>
  <p> The three look across the sands toward the mountains.<br>
    Picard glances back from where they came.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We can't go back... and we can't<br>
    stay here. We have to keep going<br>
    to the mountains. No matter<br>
    what's waiting there.</p>
  <p> He sets off, resolutely. The others follow, though the<br>

    There has to be water in here...<br>
    aren't caves formed by water?</p>
  <p> Picard runs his hands over the walls of the cave;<br>
    Wesley is scanning with the tricorder.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not necessarily... they could<br>

    (turns from wall)<br>
    These walls are dry... Mister<br>
    Crusher, do you get any moisture<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No, sir... But that E-M reading?<br>
    The pattern has changed... and<br>

  <p> Dirgo, hot and frustrated, wipes his face with his<br>
    sleeve. As he does, the bottle of liquid falls from<br>
    the pocket and onto the cave floor. Picard and Wesley<br>
    stare at it in amazement.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You have water!</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    (defensive)<br>
    I wouldn't hide water...</p>
  <p> Picard picks up the bottle, opens, smells it.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    This won't quench your thirst...<br>
    it will only make it worse.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    I'll take my chances...</p>
  <p> He extends his hand for the bottle, but Picard doesn't<br>
    yield it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not going to let you waste<br>
    this. It's more valuable to us<br>
    as a coolant or a disinfectant.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    It's mine!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Crusher, stow this with<br>
    the medical supplies and keep your<br>
    eye on it.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard tosses the bottle to him. Dirgo glares,<br>
    seething.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Now we're going to explore this<br>
    cave. Mister Crusher, look for<br>
    any indication of water, no matter<br>
    how faint. Captain Dirgo -- will<br>
    you lead the way?</p>
  <p> Picard gestures ahead of him, and Dirgo, still angry,<br>

  <p> The SOUND suddenly builds in volume, taking on a<br>
    crackle like bacon sizzling. Then suddenly, all hell<br>
    breaks loose!</p>
  <p>33 THE SENTRY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> appears -- a wave of electrical energy without<br>
    substance, possibly appearing as a sheet of crackling<br>
    lightning that buzzes and hums as it moves toward them.</p>

    Stop firing!</p>
  <p> Dirgo stops and whirls. The shimmering plane advances<br>
    toward them.</p>
  <p>34 ANGLE - THE TRIO (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Dirgo fires right at the Sentry. It stops -- then<br>
    suddenly flares out in a frightening electrical display<br>
    that ricochets from the cavern wall, and pulls the<br>
    phaser out of Dirgo's hands...</p>
  <p>35 PICARD</p>
  <p> sees that rocks have been jarred loose by the Sentry's<br>
    activities -- rocks that are beginning to tumble right<br>
    down onto Wesley. He dives toward the young man,<br>
    hurling him away from the rockslide, but taking the<br>
    first one right on his head.</p>
  <p> The Captain crumples to the ground and is bombarded<br>
    with more boulders. He writhes and twists under the<br>
    assault of rocks, then finally lies motionless, dazed<br>
    and broken. The Sentry disappears; the sound<br>
    dissipates.</p>
  <p>36 WESLEY AND DIRGO</p>
  <p> Wesley springs instantly into action, holstering his<br>
    tricorder, climbing to his feet and running toward the<br>
    Captain. Dirgo seems frozen with fear, staring at the<br>
    wounded man on the ground.</p>

  <p> Picard is lying on the ground as Wesley frantically<br>
    administers first aid. Dirgo still seems sluggish,<br>
    in shock.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Keep pressure on that wound!</p>
  <p> Dirgo has his palm pressed against Picard's forehead,<br>
    which took the initial blow and is bleeding. Wesley<br>
    is inspecting the various wounds the Captain has<br>
    sustained, checks his right leg with the tricorder.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    This is the worst break... ?</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    What was that thing... ?</p>
  <p> Wesley gives him a sharp look -- pay attention.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Keep the pressure constant.</p>
  <p> He goes for the pack of medical supplies, starts<br>
    rummaging through them. Picard opens his eyes,<br>
    struggles for clarity.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign... how bad is it?</p>
  <p> Wesley hesitates. Pretty bad, but he doesn't want to<br>
    say that.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You have a broken leg... Your<br>
    left arm is... I think there's<br>
    a fracture there, too. And you<br>
    took a bad blow to the head. But<br>
    we're getting the bleeding under<br>

    He's bleeding inside. I've seen<br>
    it before. He'll never survive.</p>
  <p> Wesley ignores him, lifts out the dresci bottle, pours<br>
    it onto a gauze pad, applies it to a wound in Picard's<br>
    chest. Picard gasps with pain.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You don't know what you're talking<br>
    about.</p>
  <p> Wesley pours more dresci onto a pad, applies it to the<br>
    head wound.</p>
  <p> DIRGO<br>
    You're wasting your time. Save<br>
    the dresci for us.</p>
  <p> Picard has had enough of being talked about in the<br>

    it if you didn't bury me before<br>
    I'm gone.</p>
  <p> Dirgo shakes his head in frustration, EXITS.</p>

  <p> Wesley starts to wrap the Captain's wounds with<br>
    sterile packs and gauze. Picard grimaces in pain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The trouble is... he may be right.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No, he's not -- you're going to<br>
    be fine...</p>
  <p> Concentrating on his task, Wesley has not realized that<br>
    Picard is gazing at him, a vague, distracted look as<br>
    though this were another time, another place. Wes<br>
    finally glances at him.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Captain... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (gently)<br>
    For a moment... I saw your<br>
    father's face in yours...</p>
  <p> Wesley sobers. This reminder of mortality is<br>
    unsettling to him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He wouldn't give up, either... even<br>
    when things looked bleakest, even<br>
    on that terrible afternoon...</p>
  <p> Picard stops, trails off, remembering Jack's death.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Strange, I always remember it as<br>
    night. Maybe... sudden,<br>
    unnecessary death ought to happen<br>
    at night... not on a bright<br>
    cloudless afternoon...</p>
  <p> He looks at Wes, as though drifting back to the here,<br>
    the now, the awful plight.</p>

    to keep a rein on Dirgo... he's<br>
    willful, stubborn... that could<br>
    be dangerous...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You'll handle him, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (sharply)<br>
    Listen to me. I have no feeling<br>
    in my right leg. My vision is<br>
    blurred... I'm going to get worse,<br>
    not better. I won't be able to<br>
    help you, Wesley. You'll have<br>
    to stand up to him on your own.</p>
  <p> Wes stares at him, wishing he'd stop talking like this<br>
    but --<br>
    WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> And Picard smiles wanly, murmurs --</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>

  <p> Wesley piles some rocks together. Picard is<br>
    unconscious. He looks flushed and feverish; his<br>
    condition has deteriorated in the last few hours.<br>
    Wesley aims his phaser at a rock and zaps. It glows,<br>
    warming them. Picard stirs, opens his eyes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Cold...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    When the sun went down, the<br>
    temperature really dropped.<br>
    (indicating fire)<br>
    This should help.</p>
  <p> Picard shifts position, tries to get comfortable,<br>
    glances at Wesley.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... don't seem to be much good<br>
    to you, Wesley...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Final Mission&quot; - REV. 9/26/90 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>55 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (hard for him to admit)<br>
    Sir... Dirgo is dead.</p>
  <p> This doesn't seem to affect Picard... he is listless,<br>
    apathetic. But Wesley's feelings of guilt and<br>
    responsibility run deeper.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I should've tried harder to stop<br>
    him...</p>
  <p> Picard shuts his eyes and shakes his head a little.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> No response. Wesley has been hoping for absolution and<br>
    he's not getting it. Now, he looks at Picard... looks<br>
    closer -- is he breathing?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Captain?<br>
    (no response; louder)<br>
    Captain Picard!</p>
  <p> Trying not to give in to panic, Wesley checks Picard's<br>
    throat for a pulse and, finding one, takes a deep<br>
    breath of relief. Picard's eyes slowly open, and he<br>
    fixes a blank gaze on Wesley.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Sir... please... stay with me...</p>
  <p> Picard summons breath, monumental effort.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm... trying...</p>
  <p> Wes glances at Picard, whose eyes are fluttering shut<br>
    again. Wesley's mind races. He doesn't want the<br>
    Captain drifting off into oblivion. He tries a new<br>
    tack.</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Captain? Remember when we took<br>
    the shuttlecraft to Starbase<br>
    Five-One-Five? I was dreading<br>
    it... six hours alone with you...</p>
  <p> He glances at Picard. The Captain is at least<br>
    listening.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But it didn't turn out the way<br>
    I thought it would... you kind<br>
    of -- opened up to me. I got to<br>
    know you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Sort of.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (with great effort)<br>
    ... it's my fault you're here...<br>
    I shouldn't have asked you...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I was honored you wanted me<br>
    along...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... I was selfish... knew I might<br>
    not see you again... forgive me...</p>
  <p> Wesley is flooded with affection for this man whom he<br>
    reveres.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Sir... the past three years...<br>
    I've lived more than most people<br>
    do in a lifetime...</p>
  <p> Wesley pauses, struggling to form the thoughts.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I think I've been pretty lucky...<br>
    no matter what happens. How many<br>
    people get to serve with -- with<br>
    Jean-Luc Picard?</p>
  <p> Now it's pouring out, a flood of affection never before<br>
    expressed.</p>

  <p>55 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You don't know this... nobody<br>
    knows this, because I never told<br>
    anybody... but a lot of what<br>
    I've worked for... school, and<br>
    science projects, and getting into<br>
    the Academy... I've done it<br>
    because... because...</p>
  <p> He hesitates, a little embarrassed now, but having gone<br>
    too far to turn back.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    Because I wanted you to be proud<br>
    of me.</p>
  <p> He looks back at Picard, afraid maybe he's said the<br>
    wrong thing, but sees that it was very right. A new<br>
    determination comes into his voice.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    One thing I learned from you...<br>
    is that you never quit. And I'm<br>
    not quitting now. I've seen you<br>
    think yourself out of worse<br>
    problems... and I'm going to<br>
    think us out of this one.</p>
  <p> Picard weakly lifts his hand; Wesley takes it, presses<br>
    it as though transfusing his strength into Picard.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You're not going to die... I won't<br>
    let you die. I'll get to the<br>
    water and I'll keep you alive<br>
    until they find us. I promise<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> Picard nods, believing in the boy's resilience. And<br>
    the two sit, hands gripped together, each drawing<br>
    strength from the other.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you certain?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is definitely debris. The<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Not necessarily, Doctor. There<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    So what is it?</p>

  <p> Wesley, too, has been up all night. His eyes are<br>
    red-rimmed, but he sticks gamely to his task. He is<br>
    working on both the tricorder and his communicator,<br>
    modifying them. He takes something from the<br>
    communicator, inserts it into the tricorder, makes a<br>
    few adjustments, tries it. He hears the Captain stir<br>
    and moan, and moves toward him. Picard's eyes open.<br>
    He looks awful -- his face grey but flushed in spots<br>
    with fever. His voice is hoarse.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign... where are we?</p>
  <p> Wesley swallows. The Captain is in worse shape than he<br>
    thought.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    We crashed, sir... we're in a<br>
    cave...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... need water...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    We -- we don't have any water.<br>
    Don't you remember? We tried to<br>
    get to the fountain... and Captain<br>
    Dirgo...</p>
  <p> Picard stares at him, and with monumental will forces<br>
    his mind to clear and grasp what Wesley is saying to<br>
    him. He becomes momentarily focused.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes... I remember...</p>
  <p> Buoyed by this response, Wesley rushes on.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But I think I'm on to something.<br>
    I've analyzed the sentry's<br>
    electrical patterns.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wesley... I may not make it...</p>
  <p> This is not what Wesley wants to hear. He rushes on.</p>

  <p>59 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm going to get to the water...<br>
    I took the transponder element<br>
    from my communicator... used it<br>
    to modify the tricorder...</p>
  <p> Picard shakes his head, knowing that Wesley is shutting<br>
    out what he doesn't want to hear.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I think I can use it to interrupt<br>
    the sentry's energy pattern...<br>
    stop it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Or at least slow it down...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Listen to me...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So much I've wanted to tell you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    At the Academy, there is<br>
    someone... who meant a great deal<br>
    to me... he has been there<br>
    &quot;forever&quot;... you must get to know<br>
    him... his name is Boothby... tell<br>
    him we were friends...</p>
  <p> Wesley hates the finality of this kind of talk, turns<br>
    away. But Picard puts out a hand, grabs his arm.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    When I was there... he helped<br>
    me... Listen to him...</p>
  <p> Wesley nods, understanding -- a mentor.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What does he teach?</p>
  <p> Picard smiles... a cracked half-grin.</p>

    for you.</p>
  <p> They exchange a long, intimate look.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go on, get the water, stay<br>
    alive... they'll find you.</p>
  <p> Wesley rises, gathers phaser, tricorder, and the empty<br>
    medical pack.</p>

  <p> Wesley fires the phaser toward the spring and --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Final Mission&quot; - REV. 9/28/90 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>59B THE SENTRY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> appears, shimmering and crackling. Wes turns, points<br>
    the tricorder toward it, and begins pushing the<br>
    controls.</p>
  <p> The sentry keeps coming.</p>
  <p> Wesley pushes more buttons, points the tricorder<br>
    purposefully toward the entity. It slows down.</p>
  <p> Buoyed, he tries something else... but --</p>
  <p>59C THE SENTRY - NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> suddenly swells in size! Frantically, Wesley punches<br>
    buttons again. The sentry shrinks... but starts<br>
    advancing once more.</p>

    alarmed. A hot wind is beginning to blow on him, his<br>
    hair blowing backward from the power of the advancing<br>
    sentry.</p>
  <p>60C WESLEY AND THE SENTRY (OPTICAL)</p>

    on... light shimmers and flashes and the forcefield<br>
    and the Sentry flicker away.</p>
  <p>60F WESLEY</p>
  <p> looks at the fountain, approaches it tentatively. He<br>
    extends his hand... further, further. The forcefield<br>
    is definitely gone.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (amazed)<br>
    It worked... !</p>
  <p> Wes grabs the medical pack, plunges into the fountain,<br>

    Captain Picard? Wake up...</p>
  <p> With his hand, he scoops some water from the pack and<br>
    carefully drizzles it on the Captain's mouth. Picard<br>
    sputters, opens his eyes. Wesley uses his other arm to<br>
    lift the Captain's head, scoops up some more water.<br>
    Picard gulps down the water which Wesley feeds him,<br>
