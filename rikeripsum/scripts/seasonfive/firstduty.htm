  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship at warp.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45703.9.<br>
    We are en route to Earth, where<br>
    it will be my pleasant duty to<br>
    deliver this year's commencement<br>
    address at Starfleet Academy.<br>
    I'm also looking forward to seeing<br>
    Wesley Crusher again. His flight<br>
    team will perform a demonstration<br>
    near Saturn that will be<br>
    transmitted to the graduation<br>
    ceremonies.</p>
  <p>2 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD, TROI and RIKER are at their seats; WORF is<br>
    at tactical, DATA at ops.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, Starfleet Academy is<br>
    requesting an update on our<br>
    estimated arrival.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    We should arrive at Earth in ten<br>
    hours, sixteen minutes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Please inform the Academy and send<br>
    my regards to Superintendant<br>
    Brand.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf works his console and sends the message.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - 1/22/92 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Do you know Admiral Brand?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We've met a few times. She's<br>
    a... formidable woman.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (ruefully)<br>
    If she's anything like my<br>
    superintendent...<br>
    (off Picard's look)<br>
    When I was at the Academy, we<br>
    had a Vulcan superintendent who<br>
    memorized the personnel file of<br>
    every single cadet. He knew<br>
    everything. It was like having<br>
    your parents there with you. All<br>
    the time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My superintendent was a Betazoid<br>
    -- a full telepath. When he<br>
    called you into his office, he<br>
    didn't have to ask what you'd<br>
    done.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (very curious)<br>
    You got called into the<br>
    superintendent's office? That<br>
    sounds like a story I'd like to<br>
    hear.</p>
  <p> Picard is not about to tell; he self-consciously<br>
    straightens his uniform. They're interrupted by a<br>
    beeping from Worf's console.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, we are being hailed by<br>
    the Academy again. It is Admiral<br>
    Brand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On-screen.</p>
  <p> There's a short beat as Picard waits for the screen<br>
    to activate.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - 1/22/92 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, she is requesting a private<br>
    channel.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker exchange a puzzled look. He gets up<br>
    and heads for the ready room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In my ready room.</p>
  <p>3 INT. READY ROOM (CONTINUOUS)</p>
  <p> as the doors open and Picard enters. He sits down and<br>
    activates his monitor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral Brand... what can I do<br>
    for you?</p>
  <p>4 ON THE MONITOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> is ADMIRAL ANDREA BRAND, a mature, elegant woman with<br>
    a commanding voice.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    Hello, Captain.</p>
  <p> She pauses for a beat... there's clearly something<br>
    wrong.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    I know you're a close friend of<br>
    the Crusher family.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes... ?</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    I wanted to inform you<br>
    personally... There's been an<br>
    accident.</p>
  <p> Off Picard's reaction.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE 4.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship drops out of warp.</p>
  <p>6 INT. BEVERLY'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Beverly and Picard are seated across from each other.<br>
    Beverly is trying to stay calm; she is quiet and<br>
    subdued, but there's an edge in her voice. She's<br>
    concentrating on the medical angle for now... trying<br>
    not to let her emotions show through.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... he had second degree burns on<br>
    his chest and a multiple fracture<br>
    of his right arm. But he's going<br>
    to be fine.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Have they completed the<br>
    regeneration series?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm... not certain.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Wesley's allergic to metorapan<br>
    treatments... they'll have to use<br>
    a bicaridine substitute.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Beverly...</p>
  <p> She picks up a PADD and begins quickly entering some<br>
    information.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I should send his complete records<br>
    to the Academy infirmary... They<br>
    probably have them already, but<br>
    it never hurts to be sure. I'll<br>
    also send them some information<br>
    on a new rybotherapy I've been<br>
    working on.</p>
  <p> Picard moves to her and his voice becomes softer, more<br>
    intimate.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Beverly...<br>
    (she looks up at him)<br>
    He's fine.</p>
  <p> Beverly holds up a hand and takes a step away from him<br>
    for a beat... looks back at him and tries to keep a<br>
    very firm grip on her emotions, but there are tears<br>
    just beneath the surface.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I know he's fine... I know he's<br>
    fine. Let's talk about something<br>
    else.<br>
    (ignoring her own<br>
    advice)<br>
    How did it happen?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Apparently, Wesley's squadron was<br>
    practicing on the Academy flight<br>
    range near Saturn... they were<br>
    in close formation when there<br>
    was a collision... all five ships<br>
    were destroyed.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Four of the cadets managed to<br>
    transport out... one did not.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Do you know who it was?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    His name was Joshua Albert.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Wesley talked about him... They<br>
    were friends...</p>
  <p> A beat; she knows it could have just as easily been<br>
    Wesley.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Wesley was so excited about making<br>
    the flight team... it made me a<br>
    little nervous, but I was proud<br>
    of him...<br>
    (difficult)<br>
    ... even though I knew there was<br>
    always the chance that...<br>
    something might...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard moves to her as Beverly's emotions rise to the<br>
    surface once again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (firmly)<br>
    Beverly. Wesley is alive and<br>
    well.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at Picard... she manages to nod and<br>
    smile at him a little through the tears in her eyes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral Brand will be holding a<br>
    full briefing after we arrive.<br>
    I'll let you know as soon as we're<br>
    in orbit.</p>
  <p> Beverly takes his hand for a beat and squeezes it<br>
    tightly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS. On Beverly as she sits down and tries<br>
    not to cry.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around Earth.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/27/92 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>8 EXT. STARFLEET ACADEMY (MATTE)</p>
  <p> Est. shot of the Starfleet Academy campus. A large,<br>
    sprawling campus in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
  <p>9 INT. ACADEMY HEARING ROOM</p>
  <p> This is one of the oldest buildings in the Academy, and<br>
    a powerful sense of tradition pervades it. The room<br>
    is probably used for both hearings and lectures. There<br>
    are several tables, on the right wall is a large<br>
    viewscreen, and several rows of benches form a gallery.</p>
  <p> There's a small group of people sitting in the gallery:<br>
    N.D. PARENTS of the flight team, including LIEUTENANT<br>
    COMMANDER ALBERT, the father of the dead cadet. Picard<br>
    and Beverly are here as well. The atmosphere is somber<br>
    and subdued. Brand is standing in front of the small<br>
    table; she's trying to keep this low-key and informal.<br>
    She is holding a PADD which she consults periodically.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    (refers to PADD)<br>
    There was very little left to<br>
    salvage from the wreckage. We<br>
    did recover one of the ships' data<br>
    recorders, but it was badly<br>
    damaged. We're attempting to<br>
    restore the information, but it's<br>
    going to take some time.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Standard procedure calls for an<br>
    immediate investigation by two<br>
    command-level officers. Captain<br>
    Satelk and I will begin taking<br>
    depositions from Nova Squadron<br>
    at fifteen-hundred hours today.<br>
    (she turns to Albert<br>
    in the audience)<br>
    Commander Albert... I'm sure that<br>
    everyone in this room joins me<br>
    in conveying my deepest sympathies<br>
    to you on the tragic loss of your<br>
    son.</p>
  <p> Albert wants to know why his son is dead... he pushes<br>
    Brand.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ALBERT<br>
    Was there any indication of a<br>
    problem before the crash? What<br>
    exactly were they doing out there?<br>
    Did they file a flight plan?</p>
  <p> Brand stops him. Her attitude is sympathetic... she<br>
    understands this is a very difficult time for him.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    (gently)<br>
    Commander... I'm sorry... right<br>
    now, we don't have those answers.<br>
    But I assure you we will<br>
    investigate this matter<br>
    thoroughly.</p>
  <p> Albert pulls himself back and nods... he knows she's<br>
    right.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    (continuing, to all)<br>
    There will be a memorial service<br>
    for Cadet Albert this evening in<br>
    the west garden.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It has been suggested that we<br>
    should cancel the graduation<br>
    ceremonies in light of what's<br>
    happened.<br>
    (she indicates Albert)<br>
    Commander Albert and I have<br>
    discussed this and we've agreed<br>
    that commencement should go<br>
    forward as planned. The cadets<br>
    should know that even after a<br>
    tragedy like this, there are still<br>
    duties to perform... and that life<br>
    continues. Thank you all for<br>
    coming.</p>
  <p>10 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as the meeting breaks up. Picard moves to Brand and<br>
    they shake hands.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    It's good to see you again,<br>
    Captain. I wish it were under<br>
    better circumstances.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's an unhappy way to begin<br>
    commencement. If you require any<br>
    assistance, Admiral, the<br>
    Enterprise is at your disposal.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    I'm sure we can handle the<br>
    investigation... but thank you<br>
    for the offer.</p>
  <p>11 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Beverly approaches Lt. Commander Albert. He is<br>
    quiet and shaken.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Commander Albert?</p>
  <p> ALBERT<br>
    Yes?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Hello, I'm Beverly Crusher. I<br>
    just wanted to say... I'm sorry<br>
    about your son.</p>
  <p> ALBERT<br>
    You're Wesley's mother...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> ALBERT<br>
    (beat; his voice begins<br>
    to break)<br>
    Josh once told me that Wesley was<br>
    the only reason he made it through<br>
    astrophysics.</p>
  <p> There's a long, difficult silence.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If there's anything I can do...</p>
  <p> Albert nods his head. It's an awkward moment. What<br>
    can anybody do?</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>12 INT. WESLEY'S DORMITORY ROOM</p>
  <p> In contrast to quarters on the Enterprise, the Academy<br>
    dorm room looks older and more lived-in. It's sparsely<br>
    furnished with a desk, a couple of chairs, and a single<br>
    bed. Everything is neat and ship-shape.</p>
  <p> Wesley is sitting on the edge of his bed. His arm is<br>
    in a 24th-century therapeutic device. He's practicing<br>
    flexing his arm... it's difficult to fully bend his arm<br>
    and he winces in pain. The effort tires him and he<br>
    takes off the device. He massages the arm with his<br>
    other hand; it's still not a hundred percent.</p>
  <p> The door chimes. He gets up, straightens his uniform,<br>
    and takes a deep breath. He moves to the door and<br>
    opens it. It's Beverly and Picard.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Wes.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Hi.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Wesley is stiff and distant. Beverly reaches out and<br>
    hugs him tightly. Finally, she releases him, and all<br>
    three move into the room. Wesley and Picard shake<br>
    hands.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How are you feeling, Wesley?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Not too bad... the arm's still<br>
    a little sore.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (gently)<br>
    We were so sorry to hear about<br>
    Joshua.</p>
  <p> Wesley just nods and says nothing. There's a brief,<br>
    awkward silence. Beverly tries to draw him out.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Would you like to talk about<br>
    it... ?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No. I don't think so. Thank you.</p>
  <p> Another long beat.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I know you're trying to help,<br>
    sir... but it seems like I<br>
    haven't talked about anything<br>
    else for the past two days. I<br>
    don't want to go over it all<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand. But I want you to<br>
    know I'm available if you should<br>
    change your mind.</p>
  <p> A beat as Beverly decides to change tacks.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    All your friends on the Enterprise<br>
    wanted you to know they're<br>
    thinking about you... Commander<br>
    Riker, Data, Robin Lefler...<br>
    everybody.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    That's nice.</p>
  <p> He doesn't go any further and there is an awkward<br>
    silence. After a beat, the door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> The doors open and Cadet 1st Class NICHOLAS LOCARNO<br>
    enters. He's well-built, charismatic, a born leader.<br>
    (Production note: cadet rank are signified by vertical<br>
    bars in place of the rank pips normally worn by<br>
    Starfleet officers.) As Locarno walks in, he sees<br>
    Picard and immediately comes to attention.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    Captain, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    At ease, Cadet.</p>
  <p> Wesley makes the introductions... but Locarno's<br>
    entrance has definitely put him on edge.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    This is my squadron leader,<br>
    Nicholas Locarno... This is<br>
    Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the<br>
    Enterprise... my mother, Doctor<br>
    Beverly Crusher.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    Hello, Doctor... Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (shakes his hand)<br>
    Mister Locarno.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    I came by to see if Wes had healed<br>
    up all right...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How are you doing, Nicholas?</p>
  <p> Locarno's feelings are sincere... he's been deeply<br>
    affected by the cadet's death.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    I'm OK.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I... just never lost anyone under<br>
    my command before.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (sympathetically)<br>
    I'm afraid it doesn't get any<br>
    easier.</p>
  <p> Wesley is starting to get a little edgey... he wants<br>
    Picard &amp; Beverly out of there.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Excuse me, Mom, Captain... but<br>
    Nick and I have some things to<br>
    talk about.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> Beverly gives him another hug.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If you need anything at all...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I know.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll see you at the inquiry.<br>
    (to Locarno)<br>
    Good to meet you, Mister Locarno.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    You too, sir.</p>
  <p> Beverly and Picard EXIT.</p>
  <p> Once they're gone, Locarno turns to Wesley, a more<br>
    serious look on his face.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    The inquiry is scheduled for<br>
    fifteen-hundred hours. Are you<br>
    ready?</p>
  <p> Wesley sits down. He suddenly looks physically and<br>
    mentally exhausted.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE 12A.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (unsure)<br>
    I think so.</p>
  <p> Locarno immediately picks up on Wesley's discomfort.<br>
    Locorno doesn't want any wavering from Wesley and so<br>
    he immediately moves to shore him up.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    (strongly)<br>
    Don't worry about it, Wes.<br>
    Everything's going to be all right<br>
    -- as long as we stick together.</p>
  <p> Wesley nods, but he is clearly troubled. Off Wesley's<br>
    expression.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>13 EXT. ACADEMY GROUNDS - DAY</p>
  <p> The grounds of the Academy are similar to any large<br>
    university: Neatly manicured lawn and hedges, one or<br>
    two statues or busts of alumni, possibly a fountain,<br>
    etc. SEVERAL CADETS can be seen moving to and from<br>
    class or talking in small groups... there is a somber<br>
    atmosphere here as the recent tragedy is still on<br>
    everyone's mind. In the distance, the Federation flag<br>
    can be seen at half-mast on a flagpole. Picard is<br>
    walking slowly across the grounds, lost in thought...</p>
  <p>14 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Picard comes to a quiet contemplative spot with a<br>
    view of the rest of the grounds. There is a large TREE<br>
    here with a couple of nearby benches. Sitting at the<br>
    foot of that tree (not on a bench) is a young MALE<br>
    CADET reading a book. It's a picture-perfect image<br>
    that is almost pastoral.</p>
  <p> Picard stops and looks at the young boy for a long beat<br>
    as if seeing a page from his youth suddenly brought to<br>
    life.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, a man wearing well-worn coveralls and boots<br>
    appears -- this is Boothby. He's an older man with<br>
    a rumpled appearance and an irascible disposition...<br>
    he holds a sharp-edged gardening tool in his hand...<br>
    a grin comes to Picard's face as he watches at a<br>
    distance. The old man moves calmly to the tree... the<br>
    cadet looks up, reacts as Boothby frowns, looks at --</p>
  <p>14A SCHOOL BOOKS</p>
  <p> lying in a nearby flowerbed, crushing some plants...</p>
  <p>15 BOOTHBY</p>
  <p> eyes of fire shoot at...</p>
  <p>15A THE CADET</p>
  <p> who grows pale... and he promptly grabs his books and<br>
    takes off...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/24/92 - ACT TWO 14.</p>
  <p>15B WIDER</p>
  <p> as Boothby shakes his head with disdain and kneels down<br>
    and begins to repair the damaged plants... Picard<br>
    quietly moves over to the tree...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Boothby?</p>
  <p> Boothby looks up, irritated... raises an eyebrow as he<br>
    sees Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (prompting)<br>
    Jean-Luc Picard... class of<br>
    twenty-seven.</p>
  <p> BOOTHBY<br>
    I know that. What happened to<br>
    your hair?</p>
  <p> Picard smiles...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How are you?</p>
  <p> BOOTHBY<br>
    I'm pretty damned cranky, thank<br>
    you. I've already replanted this<br>
    bed four times this week.</p>
  <p> Picard kneels beside him to help...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let me give you a hand...</p>
  <p> BOOTHBY<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    You?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've acquired an interest over<br>
    the years.</p>
  <p> BOOTHBY<br>
    Well, careful you don't plant 'em<br>
    too deep... the leaves...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    -- will rot...</p>
  <p> Boothby reacts to Picard's knowledge... meanwhile --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/24/92 - ACT TWO 15.</p>
  <p>15C ANGLE - A CADET</p>
  <p> is walking along the path. He suddenly freezes in<br>
    his tracks and reacts as he sees a Starfleet captain<br>
    on his knees with the gardener...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Something wrong, Cadet?</p>
  <p> CADET<br>
    Nossir, Captain.</p>
  <p> And hurries away.</p>
  <p>15D RESUME PICARD AND BOOTHBY</p>
  <p> Boothby -- who knew Picard when he was just a cadet --<br>
    is faintly amused by the lofty status he's now<br>
    achieved.</p>
  <p> BOOTHBY<br>
    Captain Picard... of the<br>
    Enterprise, no less... giving the<br>
    commencement address...</p>
  <p> He chuckles...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You sound... surprised...</p>
  <p> Boothby rises, brushes off his hands...</p>
  <p> BOOTHBY<br>
    Surprised? Uh uh. Nothing you<br>
    ever did surprised me, son.<br>
    Nothing. Except that time you<br>
    caught that Ligonian with a<br>
    reverse body lift and pinned<br>
    him in the first fourteen seconds<br>
    of the match... didn't think you<br>
    had it in you...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (grins at the memory)<br>
    Was all in the legs... from all<br>
    the running I used to do...</p>
  <p> Boothby starts to walk... Picard follows him... and<br>
    uncharacteristically struggles with saying what he<br>
    wants to say to the old man... this is like finding the<br>
    words to say &quot;I love you&quot; to your father... Picard<br>
    seems quite young during it...</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Boothby...</p>
  <p> BOOTHBY<br>
    Hmmm?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know that I've ever really<br>
    told you... how much... I<br>
    appreciate...</p>
  <p> BOOTHBY<br>
    ... there's nothing to tell...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, there is... I just wanted<br>
    to... while I was here...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You know as well as I do I would<br>
    never have made it to graduation<br>
    if you hadn't...</p>
  <p> BOOTHBY<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    You made a mistake. There isn't<br>
    a man among us who hasn't been<br>
    young enough to make one...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nevertheless, you...</p>
  <p> BOOTHBY<br>
    You knew what you had to do...<br>
    I just made sure you listened to<br>
    yourself...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    At the time I thought you were<br>
    a mean-spirited, vicious old man.</p>
  <p> BOOTHBY<br>
    I was. By the way, I was about<br>
    the same age you are now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I didn't speak to you for months.</p>
  <p> BOOTHBY<br>
    You needed to find your bearings.<br>
    I knew that. Important thing is<br>
    what you did with your life<br>
    afterwards... seems you did<br>
    okay... that's all the thanks I<br>
    need...</p>

  <p>15D CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard smiles. They reach their destination as Boothby<br>
    begins to put his tools away (?) ... a beat as Picard<br>
    changes the subject...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Did you know the boy from Nova<br>
    Squadron who was killed?</p>
  <p> Boothby glances up... and the tone of the conversation<br>
    changes notably... there is trouble in Boothby's eyes,<br>
    subtle concern in his voice...</p>
  <p> BOOTHBY<br>
    Josh Albert? Yeah.</p>
  <p> He says the next looking straight at Picard.</p>
  <p> BOOTHBY<br>
    (carefully)<br>
    Crusher. Hajar. Sito.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Locarno. I know them all.</p>
  <p> And with that Boothby abruptly moves away... and it is<br>
    such an unexpected and unsettling answer (and<br>
    delivery), that Picard cannot help but feeling<br>
    unsettled by the moment. On his reaction...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>

    17</p>
  <p>17A INT. WESLEY'S DORM ROOM</p>
  <p> Wesley, Locarno, Sito, and Hajar (as described in scene<br>
    18). They are getting ready to go into the inquiry and<br>
    Locarno, as squadron leader, is checking over the other<br>
    three as they stand at loose attention. Locarno is<br>
    a coach here, not a martinet... he's building them up,<br>
    getting them ready for some tough times ahead.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/28/92 - ACT TWO 16A.</p>
  <p>17A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He brushes off some lint from Hajar's uniform.<br>
    Locarno stays in front of Sito, who seems a little<br>
    tense.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    (to Sito)<br>
    Nervous?</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    No.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Locarno smiles... he's confident, poised... it's easy<br>
    to see why people follow him.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    That's okay... so am I.<br>
    (to everyone)<br>
    But we're going to be all right.<br>
    We have some tough times ahead...<br>
    but we've always come through for<br>
    each other.</p>
  <p> They all exchange a few looks... this is a tightly knit<br>
    group of people. Locarno takes a beat.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    Whatever happens... I want you<br>
    all to know... that leading this<br>
    team has been the high point of<br>
    my years at the Academy. No one<br>
    could have asked for a better<br>
    team... or better friends.</p>
  <p> A special moment as they silently acknowledge the bonds<br>
    that tie them to each other.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    Let's go.</p>
  <p> They all file out of the room.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/27/92 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>18 INT. ACADEMY HEARING ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The room has been set up for an informal court of<br>
    inquiry.</p>
  <p> The flags of the Federation and Starfleet have been<br>
    displayed behind the judges' table. Admiral Brand is<br>
    seated at the head table facing the rest of the room<br>
    along with CAPTAIN SATELK, a male Vulcan officer. An<br>
    antique ship's bell sits on the table in front of them.<br>
    Seated at a table facing these officers are the members<br>
    of the cadet flight team: Cadet First Class SITO, a<br>
    female Bajoran; Cadet Second Class JEAN HAJAR, a female<br>
    Human; and Wesley. SPECTATORS are seated behind the<br>
    cadets, including Picard, Beverly, and the other<br>
    parents seen earlier. Lt. Cmdr. Albert is here also.</p>
  <p> Locarno is standing near the large monitor, giving<br>
    testimony. The monitor shows a schematic DISPLAY of<br>
    SATURN, its MOONS, and the five small SHIPS of the Nova<br>
    Squadron. The ships are moving slowly toward one of<br>
    the moons. Locarno is pointing to the display as he<br>
    speaks... his attitude is honest and straightforward...<br>
    a completely believable cadet.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    ... at this point we accelerated<br>
    and executed a starboard turn of<br>
    twenty-seven degrees. We came out<br>
    of the turn on course for Titan.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    And you were still in the lead<br>
    position?</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    Continue.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    As we entered Titan's<br>
    gravitational sphere, I gave the<br>
    signal to tighten up and move into<br>
    a diamond slot formation.</p>
  <p>19 ON MONITOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The monitor ZOOMS close on the graphic symbols for the<br>
    ships as they change formation... four ships move into<br>
    position as four &quot;points&quot; of a diamond, while one ship<br>
    slides into the middle &quot;slot&quot; position. Each ship is<br>
    clearly labeled by pilot: Locarno in the lead, Hajar<br>
    in the slot, Wesley and Albert on either wing, and Sito<br>
    in the rear.</p>

  <p>20 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    Remaining in the diamond<br>
    formation, we executed a low<br>
    apogee turn around Titan... then<br>
    began a z plus twenty-five degree<br>
    climb in preparation for a Yeager<br>
    loop.</p>
  <p>20A ANGLE ON PICARD &amp; BEVERLY</p>
  <p> As they watch the proceedings. Picard is paying very<br>
    close attention to the testimony and the computer<br>
    simulation. Beverly is also watching carefully, but<br>
    she can't help but glance at Wesley every now and then.</p>
  <p>21 ON MONITOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ships on the monitor begin to turn in an intricate<br>
    looping maneuver.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    (o.c.)<br>
    Approximately nine seconds later,<br>
    Cadet Albert's ship collided with<br>
    Cadet Hajar's.</p>
  <p> On the monitor, Albert's ship hits Hajar's and all the<br>
    ships MERGE TOGETHER before WINKING OUT.</p>
  <p>22 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    We had less than two seconds to<br>
    activate our emergency<br>
    transporters and beam to the evac<br>
    station on Mimas. Everyone made<br>
    it... except Josh.</p>
  <p> Locarno is genuinely affected by the loss of his team<br>
    mate and it shows.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    Thank you, Mister Locarno.</p>
  <p> Locarno sits down at the table. Wesley and the other<br>
    cadets look a little tense.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    Cadet Hajar...</p>
  <p> Hajar stands at attention.</p>

  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    As Team Navigator, you filed a<br>
    flight plan with the Academy Range<br>
    Officer before the exercise,<br>
    correct?</p>
  <p> HAJAR<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    Did Nova Squadron deviate from<br>
    that flight plan after you entered<br>
    the Saturn range?</p>
  <p> HAJAR<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> Brand picks up a PADD and examines it for a moment.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    How do you explain the fact that<br>
    the low apogee turn around Titan<br>
    was at least two thousand<br>
    kilometers closer to the moon than<br>
    indicated in your plan?</p>
  <p> HAJAR<br>
    We were still within flight safety<br>
    parameters, sir.</p>
  <p> A frown creases Brand's forehead at the evasion.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    (curt)<br>
    That wasn't my question, Cadet.</p>
  <p> Hajar pauses before answering. She doesn't lose her<br>
    composure... looks Brand right in the eye when she<br>
    answers. Whatever she's feeling she tries to keep<br>
    inside.</p>
  <p> HAJAR<br>
    We had discussed changing the<br>
    approach after I filed the flight<br>
    plan. The final decision was made<br>
    en route to Saturn. I didn't<br>
    consider it significant enough<br>
    to mention here.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I apologize for the confusion,<br>
    sir. I should have been more<br>
    precise.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/30/92 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Brand holds Hajar's eyes for another beat, then she<br>
    turns to Satelk and lets him ask the next question.<br>
    They aren't pushing the cadets at this point. This is<br>
    still an informal hearing and not a court.</p>
  <p> SATELK<br>
    Did you see Mister Albert's ship<br>
    break formation before it collided<br>
    with your ship?</p>
  <p> HAJAR<br>
    No, sir. My first indication of<br>
    trouble was when my proximity<br>
    alarm went off.</p>
  <p> SATELK<br>
    Did any of you see the collision<br>
    take place?</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    No, sir...</p>
  <p> The others shake their heads, no.</p>
  <p>22A ON PICARD</p>
  <p> He frowns at this litany of denial. Something here<br>
    isn't making sense.</p>
  <p>22B BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> Satelk turns his gaze to Sito. Sito returns the gaze,<br>
    but we sense that inside she's uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/30/92 - ACT TWO 21-21A. </p>
  <p>22B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SATELK<br>
    Ms. Sito, you were in the tail<br>
    position; therefore, you should<br>
    have been able to see any sign<br>
    of trouble from Cadet Albert...<br>
    and yet you saw nothing?</p>
  <p> Slight hesitation from Sito.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    That is correct, sir.</p>
  <p> SATELK<br>
    Did your attention falter?</p>
  <p> Sito is in a tough position... she doesn't have an<br>
    answer to the question and is forced to manufacture one<br>
    on the spot.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    No, sir. I was... flying on<br>
    sensor readings at the time...<br>
    I did not have visual contact with<br>
    Cadet Albert's ship when he broke<br>
    formation.</p>
  <p> Keeping his expression carefully neutral, Satelk shuts<br>
    off the monitor. Brand leans to confer with him.</p>

  <p> Beverly turns to Picard with concern.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (sotto)<br>
    What's wrong?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (sotto)<br>
    It's unusual to fly on sensors<br>
    alone in that type of maneuver.<br>
    A pilot relies on the visual cues<br>
    from the other ships to maintain<br>
    formation.</p>
  <p> Brand taps the bell and brings the room to order before<br>
    Picard can speculate further.</p>
  <p>26 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Brand looks at Sito.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    If you were flying on sensors<br>
    alone, perhaps you could tell us<br>
    the orientation of his ship just<br>
    before the collision.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    I... don't know, sir.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    (voice hardens)<br>
    You were flying in a ship<br>
    traveling eighty thousand k.p.h.,<br>
    with Cadet Albert's ship less than<br>
    ten meters away... and you don't<br>
    know what his orientation was?</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    I... don't remember, sir.</p>
  <p> Brand is about to really go after Sito when Locarno<br>

    Sir, if I may?</p>
  <p> Brand considers them both, then nods after a beat.</p>

    difficulties. He would get<br>
    nervous during close flybys and<br>
    pull away in the final seconds...<br>
    his formation flying was a little<br>
    erratic.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    (sharp)<br>
    And you didn't report any of this?</p>
  <p> Locarno faces her squarely... he is the leader taking<br>
    responsibility and he is totally believable.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    No sir, I didn't. We'd flown<br>
    together a long time... I thought<br>
    he could handle it if I gave<br>
    him a chance. I was wrong.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    Then you're saying that the<br>
    accident was Cadet Albert's fault?</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    (beat, then very<br>
    reluctant)<br>
    I think Josh got frightened and<br>
    tried to pull out of the turn<br>
    prematurely... and then crashed<br>
    into Cadet Hajar.<br>
    (beat; tries to explain)<br>
    Josh was our friend... we didn't<br>
    want him to be remembered as<br>
    someone who panicked.</p>
  <p>26A ON WESLEY</p>
  <p> He's shocked by what Locarno's just said -- but keeps<br>
    it inside. The other two cadets trade nervous glances,<br>
    but try not to let their anxiety show.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/24/92 - ACT TWO 23A.</p>
  <p>26B ON ALBERT</p>
  <p> Lt. Cmdr. Albert is shaken by Locarno's statement...<br>
    it's a hard thing to hear about your own son.</p>
  <p>26C ON PICARD</p>
  <p> Picard is disturbed... not quite sure what to make of<br>
    this new piece of information.</p>

  <p>26D NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    Please be seated.</p>
  <p> Locarno sits and ignores the looks from Wesley and the<br>
    other cadets. Brand confers briefly with Satelk for a<br>
    moment. Brand looks directly at the members of the<br>
    Nova Squadron for a long beat. There is an edge of<br>
    anger in her voice.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    I am... disturbed by what I've<br>
    heard here today. By your own<br>
    admission, you allowed your<br>
    teammate to fly when you knew he<br>
    was having difficulties<br>
    maintaining formation. That<br>
    demonstrates a serious lack of<br>
    judgment.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I am also disturbed by the fact<br>
    that you did not come forward with<br>
    this information immediately.<br>
    (picks up PADD)<br>
    We should have the first data<br>
    from Mister Crusher's flight<br>
    recorder tonight. We will<br>
    reconvene at thirteen hundred<br>
    hours tomorrow.</p>
  <p> She taps the bell and everyone stands up as the inquiry<br>
    is recessed.</p>
  <p>26E ON THE FLIGHT TEAM</p>
  <p> They stand up and Wesley turns to face Locarno.<br>
    Locarno is cool... he smiles confidently.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    Everything's fine. Trust me.</p>
  <p> Locarno EXITS along with the crowd. Hajar and Sito<br>
    follow him and Wesley is left feeling a swirl of<br>
    conflicting emotions.</p>

    Captain, the Academy has one of<br>

    we'll have much to contribute to<br>

    That may well be the case.<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Understood, sir. We'll get right<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good. I've spoken with Admiral<br>

  <p>29 INT. WESLEY'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Wesley, Locarno, Hajar, and Sito are gathered in the<br>
    room, in the middle of a heated discussion.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    You shouldn't have said it, Nick.<br>
    Josh wasn't responsible for what<br>
    happened.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    I had to do something...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You said we wouldn't have to lie<br>
    to them. We all agreed not to<br>
    lie to them.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    I didn't lie. Everything I said<br>
    was true.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    The accident was not Josh's fault.</p>
  <p> Locarno's tone becomes more personal. He's rallying<br>
    his troops during a crisis... trying to make them all<br>
    pull together.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/28/92 - ACT THREE 27.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He's part priest, part politician -- an earnest,<br>
    believable young man with the capacity to sway people<br>
    to his cause. There's nothing consciously manipulative<br>
    in Locarno; he's one of the best and the brightest.<br>
    His only flaw is ambition -- without that, he might<br>
    have been one of the best the Academy has ever seen.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    (gentle)<br>
    Look... he was my friend, too.<br>
    I worked to get him on this team.<br>
    But the truth is... he panicked.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    We don't know that...</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    Of course we do... none of us has<br>
    wanted to say it out loud... but<br>
    we've all had the same thought.<br>
    Haven't we?</p>
  <p> He looks at Hajar and Sito... they don't deny it.<br>
    Hajar finally nods.</p>
  <p> HAJAR<br>
    He must have pulled away too soon.<br>
    I think he got scared.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    Sito?</p>
  <p> Sito looks away... then nods reluctantly. Locarno<br>
    turns back to Wesley. Wesley is still upset about<br>
    this... he turns away from the others. Locarno tries<br>
    to gently bring him back into the fold.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. /29/92 - ACT THREE 27A.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    (patient)<br>
    Wes... I know you want to protect<br>
    his memory... we all do. But --<br>
    we have to look out for<br>
    ourselves now.<br>
    (sarcastic)<br>
    What do you want us to do, walk in<br>
    and tell them everything that<br>
    happened?</p>
  <p> There's a silent beat. Sito fills in the gap.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    We might as well turn in our<br>
    uniforms and start packing our<br>
    bags.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    (to everyone)<br>
    Are we ready for that?</p>
  <p> A long beat. None of them, even Wesley, is ready to<br>
    leave the Academy. Sito and Hajar are now firmly with<br>
    Locarno although Wesley is still struggling. Locarno<br>
    picks up a PADD.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    We'll take this one step at a<br>
    time.<br>
    (hands PADD to Wes)<br>
    This is the preliminary report<br>
    on your flight recorder.<br>

  <p> LOCARNO (cont'd)<br>
    It was so badly damaged in the<br>
    crash, the lab was only able to<br>
    retrieve a third of the total<br>
    telemetry on the recorder... and<br>
    all of it is from before the<br>
    collision.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    There is no problem here.</p>
  <p> Wesley looks at the PADD for a beat... struggles...<br>
    finally looks up at Locarno.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Nick... I don't think I can do<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> Locarno knows this is a crucial moment, but he doesn't<br>
    push... he doesn't want to come down too hard on<br>
    Wesley... that might make him dig in his heels. He<br>
    lets Sito step in.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    You don't have to lie... just<br>
    don't volunteer any new<br>
    information.</p>
  <p> It's three against one... but Wesley still isn't<br>
    entirely comfortable with this. Locarno eyes him,<br>
    smiles ruefully.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    The first night I met you, Wes...<br>
    I knew I wanted you on this squad.<br>
    I knew what you'd bring to it...<br>
    you, more than any of the others,<br>
    would understand what it means<br>
    to be able to count on someone.<br>
    You've been out there, putting<br>
    yourself on the line... you know<br>
    you've got to be able to trust<br>
    the people on your team...<br>
    because your life is in their<br>
    hands.<br>

  <p> LOCARNO (cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And their lives are in yours.</p>
  <p> Wesley is definitely being moved by this speech.<br>
    Locarno moves closer, becoming more passionate.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/28/92 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    We made a promise, right in the<br>
    beginning, that we'd stick<br>
    together. We were Nova Squadron<br>
    -- nobody else could say that.<br>
    And even after we graduated we'd<br>
    try to get posted to the same<br>
    duty... we were going to be a<br>
    team -- for a long time.</p>
  <p> He looks at Hajar and Sito... back to Wesley.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    Josh can't be a part of those<br>
    plans anymore. But I think he'd<br>
    still want us to be a team.<br>
    What do you think?</p>
  <p> Wesley looks at his friends... feels the bonds that tie<br>
    him to these people... and finally nods in acceptance.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>30 OMITTED</p>
  <p>30A INT. HEARING ROOM - NIGHT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The room is empty and the lighting is subdued. Wesley<br>
    is standing near the large monitor, holding the PADD<br>
    seen earlier. On the screen is another SCHEMATIC<br>
    DIAGRAM of Saturn and the Nova ships similar to the one<br>
    seen earlier during Locarno's testimony. Wesley looks<br>
    from the screen to the PADD and makes some notations<br>
    on the PADD. Albert's voice interrupts his work.</p>
  <p> ALBERT (o.c.)<br>
    Mister Crusher?</p>
  <p>30B NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Wesley turns around to find Lt. Cmdr. Albert has just<br>
    entered and is standing near the back of the room. He<br>
    is carrying a sweater in one hand. Wesley quickly<br>
    stands at attention.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/28/92 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>30B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Sir.</p>
  <p> ALBERT<br>
    At ease.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Am I interrupting?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No, sir. I was just going over<br>
    my deposition for tomorrow.</p>
  <p> Wesley touches a control on the wall and the image on<br>
    the monitor DISAPPEARS. Albert moves into the room...<br>
    this is an awkward meeting for him... but he needs to<br>
    do this.</p>
  <p> ALBERT<br>
    They told me... I could find you<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> Wesley nods and there is a long beat. Albert looks at<br>
    the sweater for a moment.</p>
  <p> ALBERT<br>
    I... found this in Josh's room...<br>
    I... I think it belongs to you.</p>
  <p> He hands the sweater to Wesley, who looks at it for a<br>
    moment... then remembers.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    The ski trip...<br>
    (looks at Albert)<br>
    We went to Calgary last month...<br>
    Josh forgot his sweater... so he<br>
    borrowed one of mine.</p>
  <p> Albert nods and there is a silent beat as Wesley looks<br>
    at the jacket. This is a very difficult conversation<br>
    for both of them. Albert is trying to reach out to<br>
    Wesley... even to apologize in some small way for his<br>
    son's mistake, and this only makes Wesley's feelings<br>
    of guilt even more intense.</p>
  <p> ALBERT<br>
    He told me you... helped him with<br>
    his classes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/28/92 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>30B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    A little... he only needed help<br>
    with statistical mechanics.</p>
  <p> ALBERT<br>
    (slight smile)<br>
    If Josh had one weakness, it was<br>
    mathematics...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    He could do it...<br>
    (smile)<br>
    He just didn't like to.</p>
  <p> ALBERT<br>
    His mother and I thought he'd<br>
    never make it out of calculus.<br>
    Then he found out what the Academy<br>
    entrance requirements were like...<br>
    that turned him around. He stayed<br>
    after class, got a tutor... he<br>
    worked really hard.</p>
  <p> Albert smiles proudly at the memory.</p>
  <p> ALBERT<br>
    He never gave up on anything...<br>
    (beat, then very<br>
    difficult)<br>
    I... I know that... he had a lot<br>
    of respect for you, and everyone<br>
    on the team. I realize this was<br>
    his fault... and that... you<br>
    could've all been killed. I...<br>
    I wanted to... to say...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - 1/22/92 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>30B CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Albert's emotions are coming to the surface despite his<br>
    best efforts. Wesley feels trapped, unable to put this<br>
    man's mind at ease and yet horrified at the pain Albert<br>
    is obviously in. Albert steels himself and looks<br>
    Wesley straight in the eye.</p>
  <p> ALBERT<br>
    (voice breaking)<br>
    I wanted to say that I'm sorry.<br>
    I'm sorry he let you down.</p>
  <p> Albert turns and EXITS before his feelings get the<br>
    better of him. Wesley is left standing alone in the<br>
    room holding his jacket and feeling a swirl of<br>
    conflicting emotions.</p>

  <p>33 INT. HEARING ROOM</p>
  <p> Wesley is standing near the wall monitor and everyone<br>
    else is in the same positions as seen in Act Two,<br>
    including Picard and Beverly. The strain is starting<br>
    to show on Wesley... he is tired and worn.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    Are you ready, Mister Crusher?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Brand touches a button on her table and the LIGHTS in<br>
    the room DIM.</p>
  <p>34 ANGLE ON MONITOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The wall monitor shows a caption reading &quot;SHIP'S LOG:<br>

  <p> The perspective is from over the head of the pilot,<br>
    giving us a look out the front of his canopy. The top<br>
    of Wesley's flight helmet is visible in the bottom of<br>
    the frame, but most of the cockpit is hidden from view.<br>
    Superimposed over the picture are various computer<br>
    readouts showing speed, course, g-forces, sensor<br>
    information, etc.</p>
  <p> The footage is quite distorted; as Wesley talks, the<br>
    image JUMPS and FUZZES periodically and sometimes<br>
    breaks up altogether. At the moment, no other ships<br>
    can be seen out of the canopy.</p>

  <p> BRAND<br>
    That is the extent of the data<br>
    we were able to recover from the<br>

    will you describe what happened<br>
    after you left orbit of Titan?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Once we'd cleared the moon...<br>
    Mister Locarno led us into a<br>
    Yeager loop... about nine seconds<br>
    later, everything seemed to happen<br>
    at once: the proximity alarm went<br>
    off, I tried to veer away, but<br>
    it was too late... I was hit...<br>
    I lost control of the ship and<br>
    a power coupling exploded in the<br>
    cockpit... I don't know how, but<br>
    I managed to activate my escape<br>
    transporter... the next thing<br>
    I remember was finding myself in<br>
    the emergency evac station on<br>
    Mimas with the rest of the<br>
    squadron... except Josh.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    Do you have anything to add to<br>
    your testimony?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> Brand and Satelk exchange a look. Satelk folds his<br>
    hands in front of him and regards Wesley severely.</p>
  <p> SATELK<br>

    ships flip over and accelerate<br>
    in a new direction.</p>
  <p> Satelk gives Wesley a very direct look.</p>
  <p> SATELK<br>
    Mister Crusher, did your team<br>

  <p> Wesley takes a long beat before he answers.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    I want you to be absolutely clear<br>
    on this point, Mister Crusher.<br>
    Before the collision, was Nova<br>
    Squadron in a diamond slot<br>
    formation?</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Everything's going to be okay,<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Data and Geordi are already<br>

    the satellite transmission.</p>
  <p> Wesley reacts with surprise.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There must be something wrong<br>
    with the satellite data... it<br>
    might have been tampered with...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Mom... that doesn't make any<br>
    sense...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well there has to be some<br>
    explanation... I know you're<br>
    telling the truth... but that<br>
    satellite data made it look like<br>
    you were lying.</p>
  <p> Wesley suddenly feels a tremendous burden of guilt as<br>
    his mother rises to his defense.</p>

  <p> Wesley can't let his mother put herself on the line<br>
    like this. He stops her.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>

  <p> Wesley looks at her for a long beat. Beverly's faith<br>
    and belief in her son only compounds his sense of<br>
    guilt.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Don't try to protect me, Mom...<br>
    Please just... stay out of it.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at Wesley. She suddenly realizes he's<br>
    telling her that he's not completely innocent. The<br>
    revelation takes the wind out of her sails. Her<br>
    reaction is one of shock and sorrow, not recrimination.<br>

  <p> BOOTHBY<br>
    Well... the cadets today are just<br>

    celebration they held after Nova<br>
    won the Rigel Cup made 'twenty-four<br>
    look like a dinner party.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    To the other cadets, the members<br>
    of that team are gods... and<br>
    that's a hard image to live up<br>
    to. But Nick Locarno... he<br>
    watches out for them... he keeps<br>
    them together.<br>

    Nick is what makes that team<br>
    special... he's their coach,<br>
    surrogate father, and best friend<br>
    all in one... a natural leader.<br>
    (looks at Picard)<br>
    The members of that team love<br>
    him... if he asks them to do<br>
    something, they do it... even<br>

    He just asked me not to help<br>

    We do know the collision occurred<br>

    or how the crash occurred.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We have unsuccessfully tried over<br>
    fifty different computational<br>

    the movements of Nova Squadron<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Did Wesley's flight recorder<br>
    indicate there was anything...<br>
    unusual about the ship or the way<br>
    it was operating?</p>
  <p> Geordi looks at Data and tries to think.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, the starboard power flow<br>
    was fluctuating.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    However, it was well within<br>
    operational limits.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (thinking)<br>
    The fluidic pressure in the<br>
    landing struts was low, but I<br>
    don't know what difference that<br>
    would make.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    We did find that Wesley had<br>
    opened his coolant interlock just<br>
    before beginning the maneuver<br>
    around Titan.</p>

  <p>53 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Which is a little unusual. The<br>
    interlock is normally closed<br>
    unless you're performing a check<br>
    on the engine coolant levels.<br>
    But there's no evidence Wesley<br>
    was running that kind of check.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (musing)<br>
    Filling the primary coolant tanks<br>
    requires an open interlock...<br>
    but that can only be done in a<br>
    maintenance bay. What other<br>
    reasons are there to open that<br>
    valve?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's the first step in purging<br>
    the plasma exhaust.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (objecting)<br>
    That procedure would be extremely<br>
    hazardous while the ship was in<br>
    flight.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah, the engine would probably<br>
    ignite the plasma.</p>

    doesn't yield.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (stiffly)<br>
    I... choose not to answer, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard regards him seriously... he gets up from the<br>
    desk and moves closer to Wesley. His attitude is firm<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    You choose not to answer... and<br>
    yet you've already given an answer<br>

    was a lie.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I said the accident occurred after<br>
    the loop, and it did.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (hard)<br>
    But you neglected to mention the<br>
    fact that following the loop your<br>
    team executed a dangerous maneuver<br>
    which was the direct cause of the<br>

  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    You're going to tell them what<br>
    happened. You. Alone. Are going<br>
    to decide what happens to me...<br>
    to Sito... to Jean. You're going<br>
    to decide that.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm not going to lie to them<br>
    again, Nick... I can't live with<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> Locarno moves in on Wesley... his pain and anger<br>
    building with his every move.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    You can't lie to them... you can't<br>
    live with it... you have to tell<br>
    them what happened. Who the hell<br>
    are you?</p>
  <p> As Locarno asks Wesley this last question, he SHOVES<br>
    Wesley back. Wesley is surprised by the physical<br>
    manifestation of Locarno's betrayal. Locarno keeps<br>
    moving forward.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/28/92 - ACT FIVE 51A.</p>
  <p>62 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    Nick...</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    (shoves him again)<br>
    You're going to turn us in?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Hey, wait a minute...</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    (shoves him hard)<br>
    No, you wait a minute...</p>
  <p> Wesley's temper rises and he SHOVES Locarno back. They<br>
    both freeze and there is a tense moment... finally<br>
    Locarno takes a couple of steps away from Wesley to<br>
    get a grip on his temper. After a beat, Locarno turns<br>
    back to face Wesley.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    He got to you, didn't he? Picard<br>
    gave you a big speech about duty<br>
    and honor...</p>
  <p> Wesley doesn't say anything, but it's clear that<br>
    Locarno is right.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    (bitter)<br>
    It must've been a pretty good<br>
    speech to make you want to turn<br>
    your back on your friends.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    We're Starfleet cadets, we have<br>
    a duty to the truth.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    What about your duty to your<br>
    friends?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/28/92 - ACT FIVE 51B.</p>
  <p>62 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Locarno takes a beat... he feels angry, hurt,<br>
    betrayed... and he doesn't hesitate to let Wesley know<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    I got you on this team... I gave<br>
    you a chance when there were<br>
    upperclassmen waiting in line.<br>
    I said, &quot;He won't let us down.<br>
    He was on the Enterprise. He<br>
    knows what it's like to trust<br>
    somebody with his life.&quot; I guess<br>
    I was wrong...</p>
  <p> Locarno's words hit Wesley hard... he's really<br>
    struggling here.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Nick, if we all come forward<br>
    together... tell Admiral Brand---</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    We don't want to come forward...<br>
    Sito and Jean and me... we don't<br>
    have a problem with this.</p>
  <p> Locarno looks at Wesley for a long beat.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    But if you do... then resign your<br>
    appointment to the Academy and<br>
    walk away. Don't make us pay for<br>
    your guilty conscience.</p>
  <p> Wesley looks at him for a beat... he's beginning to<br>
    see another side of Locarno here... the driving<br>
    ambition that is his hidden flaw.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You'd let me do it, wouldn't you?<br>
    You'd let me throw my career away<br>
    just to save your neck.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/28/92 - ACT FIVE 51C.</p>
  <p>62 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    To save the team. That's more<br>
    important than you and it's more<br>
    important than me.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And if I was in your place... I'd<br>
    do it. Without hesitation.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But that's me.</p>
  <p> Locarno turns his back on Wesley and walks out of the<br>
    room. Off Wesley's expression...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>63 INT. HEARING ROOM</p>
  <p> It's the next day. The room is once again filled with<br>
    spectators, the flight team, Beverly, Picard, and<br>
    Albert. Everyone is waiting... finally Brand and<br>
    Satelk ENTER and take their seats. Brand strikes the<br>
    bell and brings the room to order. She regards the<br>
    flight team with a grim expression... her tone is<br>
    somewhat challenging... she knows that something's<br>
    wrong and that the cadets hold the answer, but she<br>
    can't do anything about it.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    Captain Satelk and I have gone<br>
    over your testimony and the<br>
    physical evidence from the crash.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Your statements cannot be<br>
    reconciled with the data collected<br>
    from the NavCon satellite.<br>
    Your unwillingness to offer any<br>
    explanation for this contradiction<br>
    is disappointing, and it raises<br>
    suspicion. We cannot escape the<br>
    conclusion that either the data<br>
    is faulty in some way... or you<br>
    have lied to us.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    However... suspicion is not<br>
    proof... and I have no proof that<br>
    you have lied to this inquiry.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/28/92 - ACT FIVE 51D.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BRAND (cont'd)<br>
    Therefore... unless further<br>
    evidence is presented, I have no<br>
    choice but to close this<br>
    investigation.<br>
    (long beat)<br>
    For filing an inaccurate flight<br>
    plan, and for allowing Cadet<br>
    Albert to fly despite the fact<br>
    that you knew he had been having<br>
    difficulties, I am ordering a<br>
    formal reprimand placed on each<br>
    of your permanent records. I am<br>
    also revoking your flight<br>
    privileges.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    This inquiry is closed.</p>
  <p>64 ON WESLEY</p>
  <p> As he stands.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/28/92 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>64 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (to Brand)<br>
    Sir... I would like to add<br>
    something to my testimony.</p>
  <p>65 ON PICARD</p>
  <p> he's concerned... he doesn't know what Wesley is going<br>
    to do, but he hopes he'll do the right thing.</p>
  <p>65A ON LOCARNO</p>
  <p> He's not sure what Wesley's going to do either... will<br>
    he resign or turn them all in?</p>
  <p>66 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Brand glances at Satelk for a beat.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    Proceed, Mister Crusher.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yesterday, I testified that the<br>
    crash occurred following a Yeager<br>
    loop. That's not entirely true.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We did perform the loop. But<br>
    after that, we broke formation...<br>
    and attempted a Kolvoord<br>
    Starburst.</p>
  <p> Reactions from Satelk and Brand... they recognize the<br>
    maneuver and all that it implies.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    We knew it was prohibited and that<br>
    it would be dangerous, but we<br>
    wanted to do something spectacular<br>
    for the commencement<br>
    demonstration... So we pushed<br>
    Josh... and he wasn't ready.<br>
    We thought we could do it... we<br>
    thought we could do anything.<br>
    We were wrong... and Josh died.</p>
  <p> Wesley turns to face Albert's father sitting in the<br>
    audience.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Josh didn't let us down, sir.<br>
    It wasn't his fault.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/27/92 - ACT FIVE 52A.</p>
  <p>66 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Albert nods in silent understanding. Wesley sits<br>
    down. After a beat, Brand turns to the rest of the<br>
    flight team.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - 1/22/92 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>66 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    Cadet Sito, is this true?</p>
  <p> A beat as Sito makes the decision.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    Cadet Hajar?</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> HAJAR<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    Mister Locarno, you're the leader<br>
    of Nova Squadron... do you have<br>
    anything to say?</p>
  <p> Locarno doesn't move. A long beat passes.</p>
  <p> BRAND<br>
    Mister Locarno?</p>
  <p> Beat. Locarno stands at attention.</p>
  <p> LOCARNO<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> Hold for a beat...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>67 EXT. STARFLEET ACADEMY (MATTE SHOT)</p>
  <p> The Academy as seen earlier.</p>
  <p>68 EXT. ACADEMY GROUNDS - DAY</p>
  <p> As seen earlier. Wesley is standing near the elm tree,<br>
    waiting. After a beat, Picard comes over to him.<br>
    Picard is grim... Wesley doesn't have to ask the<br>
    question.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Locarno has been expelled.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - 1/22/92 - ACT FIVE 53A.</p>
  <p>68 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Wesley reacts with shock and disbelief.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (bitter)<br>
    They should've expelled all of<br>
    us.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/24/92 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>68 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They almost did. But... Mister<br>
    Locarno made an impassioned plea<br>
    for the rest of you. He said he<br>
    used his influence as squadron<br>
    leader to convince you all to<br>
    try the Kolvoord maneuver and<br>
    then to cover up the truth.<br>
    He asked to take full<br>
    responsibility.</p>
  <p> Hearing about his friend's final gesture makes this<br>
    even harder on Wesley.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (a sad laugh)<br>
    He did exactly what he said he<br>
    would -- he protected the team.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I feel awful... I've let everybody<br>
    down... my friends, Mom, you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You should feel bad... and you<br>
    will pay for what you did.<br>
    Admiral Brand has decided that,<br>
    in addition to a formal reprimand,<br>
    your academic credits for the past<br>
    year will be cancelled and you will<br>
    not advance with your class.</p>
  <p> Wesley is a little taken back by this punishment...<br>
    but he doesn't complain.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I understand.</p>
  <p> Picard considers him for a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It won't be easy... staying here<br>
    on campus with everyone knowing<br>
    what you did... I think you have<br>
    some rough times ahead.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir.<br>
    (beat, heartfelt)<br>
    Captain... thank you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The First Duty&quot; - REV. 1/24/92 - ACT FIVE 54A.</p>
  <p>68 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (echoing Boothby's<br>
    words)<br>
    You knew what you had to do...<br>
    I just made sure you listened<br>
    to yourself.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Good-bye, Cadet.</p>
  <p> They shake hands.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Good-bye, Captain.</p>
  <p> They leave in opposite directions.</p>
