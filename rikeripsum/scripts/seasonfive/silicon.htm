    &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. MELONA COLONY - DAY</p>
  <p> A lush and verdant world of hills, grasses, and wild<br>
    flowers... no structures there yet, but flags and<br>
    taped-off areas suggest buildings to come. Our people<br>
    -- RIKER, DATA, BEVERLY -- mingle with civilian humans,<br>
    all involved in mapping, measuring, and surveying this<br>
    halcyon valley. A portable map table stands in the<br>
    clearing; Riker and CARMEN DAVILA, an engineer with a<br>
    keen mind and wry wit, inspect schematics of proposed<br>
    structures.</p>
  <p> CARMEN<br>
    ... and the hospital facility --<br>
    (pointing)<br>
    -- will stand there, facing north,<br>
    in that grove of trees.</p>
  <p> She turns ninety degrees, gestures again.</p>
  <p> CARMEN<br>
    The school and the arts center<br>
    will be here, centrally located<br>
    among the residential pods.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    Looks good. At this rate you<br>
    should be ready for the next wave<br>
    of colonists in about six months.<br>
    (eyeing the terrain)<br>
    I have to say I envy you... this<br>
    is a beautiful place to put down<br>
    roots.</p>
  <p> CARMEN<br>
    Somehow, Commander... you don't<br>
    strike me as the kind that puts<br>
    down roots...</p>
  <p> He gives her an easy grin.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No? How do I strike you?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> CARMEN<br>
    (playful)<br>
    As... a free spirit. An<br>
    adventurer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ah. And aren't pioneers, like<br>
    you, adventurers at heart?</p>
  <p> CARMEN<br>
    Of course. But we also have<br>
    this... nesting instinct. It's<br>
    exciting to find a new world --<br>
    but the joy comes in making it<br>
    a home. Building houses. Having<br>
    children. Roots.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Very interesting. I'd love to<br>
    discuss this further with you.<br>
    Dinner tonight?</p>
  <p> CARMEN<br>
    If you want to share camp rations<br>
    in my tent -- I'd be delighted.</p>
  <p> The briefest hesitation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Haven't we managed to get a<br>
    replicator down here yet?</p>
  <p> She laughs merrily... the banter between them is<br>
    easy-going and comfortable. It suggests a relationship<br>
    that's ongoing.</p>
  <p> CARMEN<br>
    No, we haven't... but I've been<br>
    saving my ration of dried chicken<br>
    curry. It should go very nicely<br>
    with that bottle of wine I happen<br>
    to know you brought with you...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's sounding better all the<br>
    time...</p>
  <p> CARMEN<br>
    And as you know... I provide the<br>
    most memorable desserts...</p>
  <p> Riker grins. He's obviously had those desserts before.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    My favorite part of dinner...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (o.c.)<br>
    (calling)<br>
    Will... Carmen...</p>
  <p> They turn and Beverly approaches with Data.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We've been going over the<br>
    schematics for the hospital. The<br>
    location seems fine...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    When the Enterprise comes back<br>
    tomorrow, we'll bring a crew<br>
    down here and get started.</p>
  <p> A low WHIRR catches their attention. They stop, look<br>
    around for the source of the sound, not yet concerned.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Carmen... do you have some<br>
    construction started I don't know<br>
    about?</p>
  <p> CARMEN<br>
    No... what is that?</p>
  <p> They all look around as the sound becomes more<br>
    pronounced. They're puzzled... not really alarmed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not recognize the sound.</p>
  <p> He turns around, trying to catch its direction. The<br>
    WHIRRR is louder now, and the breeze picks up a little.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe the sound is coming from<br>
    above...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; -REV. 8/6/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> All look upward. The brilliance of the sun-filled day<br>
    fades a bit... light dims as if a veil were being<br>
    pulled across the sky. The other colonists are milling<br>
    about, becoming apprehensive.</p>
  <p> CARMEN<br>
    Will... what is it?</p>
  <p> The breeze really kicks up now, and the noise is<br>
    building in intensity.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe an atmospheric<br>
    disturbance...</p>
  <p>2 ANGLE ON THE SKY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> from their POV. Across the darkened sky a white spot<br>
    of something is approaching -- at an incredible speed.</p>
  <p>3 RIKER AND OTHERS</p>
  <p> stare at the object... Riker's face suddenly shows an<br>
    awful recognition, a terrible disbelief.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data -- what's our best bet for<br>
    cover?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There are subterranean caverns<br>
    beneath the hills to the east.<br>
    (points)<br>
    Approximately one kilometer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Carmen, start rounding everybody<br>
    up.</p>
  <p> CARMEN<br>
    But --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've seen it before -- we know<br>
    what it is. Now get moving!</p>
  <p> She stares at him, then turns and starts running.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - REV. 8/2/91 - TEASER 4A.</p>
  <p>4 ON THE SKY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> from Riker's POV the approaching object has taken<br>
    form... a huge crystal form descending toward the<br>
    planet... a vast shimmering, faceted shape... ominous<br>
    in its cold beauty. The Crystalline Entity advances<br>
    on the outpost.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - REV. 8/6/91 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.</p>
  <p>5 EXT. MELONA COLONY - MINUTES LATER</p>
  <p> The wind is whipping now, and the SOUND is immense. A<br>
    sense of urgency has overtaken the colonists, though<br>
    they're trying not to panic. Riker, Beverly, Data, and<br>
    Carmen are herding people together.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's go!<br>
    (calling)<br>
    Beverly! This way!</p>
  <p>6 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> on Beverly, herding people together.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Okay, people... stay calm... let's<br>
    go...</p>
  <p> They move in the direction indicated by Riker.</p>
  <p>7 ON RIKER AND GROUP</p>
  <p> as he waves the colonists to follow Data.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Follow him! Follow him! Go!</p>
  <p> Grateful to have direction, the colonists begin<br>
    swarming toward Data, running with him toward what they<br>
    hope is safety.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - REV. 8/2/91 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker hurries along the last of the wind-whipped<br>
    stragglers, including Carmen, who's helping A CHILD.<br>
    Riker runs to them and swoops the child up in his arms.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's go!</p>
  <p> They set out at a run.</p>
  <p>8 IN THE SKY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Crystalline Entity now hovers above the outpost, a<br>
    majestic and ominous form.</p>
  <p>9 ANGLE ON TREE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A brilliant beam of light sweeps down from the Entity<br>
    like a giant scythe, cutting a huge swath. The light<br>
    encases everything in its path, suffuses it in the<br>
    white-hot light... and then sweeps on. The tree and<br>
    everything else in this arc of destruction is reduced<br>
    to a pile of dust.</p>
  <p>10 ON THE COLONISTS</p>
  <p> as they watch, horrified, still on the run. A few<br>
    panic and start to run off to the sides; Data and<br>
    Beverly take them by the arm and pull them back with<br>
    the group.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This way! Stay together!</p>
  <p> The colonists run in panic. Bursts of white light<br>
    illuminate them as the Entity devours more of the<br>
    countryside.</p>
  <p>11<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    12</p>
  <p>13 ANGLE ON RIKER</p>
  <p> hurrying the people along, keeping an eye over his<br>
    shoulder at the progress of the Entity. Suddenly --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - REV. 8/2/91 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> CARMEN (o.c.)<br>
    Will... help us!</p>
  <p> He turns to see Carmen heading for AN OLDER MAN who's<br>
    having trouble keeping up. He stumbles; Carmen runs<br>
    for him. Riker gives the child to Data and starts<br>
    toward her.</p>
  <p>14 ANGLE ON CARMEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as she heads for the man, fighting the buffeting winds.<br>
    Suddenly the arc of light comes sweeping toward her<br>
    and the old man... races over them... and they're both<br>
    gone. Piles of silt remain.</p>
  <p>15 ON RIKER</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Carmen!</p>
  <p> He watches her disappear, helpless. Then he<br>
    continues his pell mell race for the caves.</p>
  <p>16 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is at warp, heading toward Melona.</p>
  <p>17 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD, WORF, TROI, ENSIGN at the conn, and<br>
    SUPERNUMERARIES.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain... sensors are indicating<br>
    a disturbance near the outpost<br>
    on Melona Four.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What kind of disturbance?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I can't tell. We are still too<br>
    far away. It could be an<br>
    electrical storm...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - REV. 8/2/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard nods. Probably nothing... but he'd like to make<br>
    sure.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    See if you can make contact with<br>
    the colony...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How far are we?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    At current speed, twenty-seven<br>
    hours.</p>
  <p> Picard nods, acknowledging.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, I get no response from<br>
    Melona colony. But the<br>
    disturbance in the atmosphere is<br>
    increasing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Bridge to La Forge...</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    La Forge here, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you picking up readings from<br>
    Melona?</p>
  <p>18 INT. ENGINEERING - INTERCUTTING</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, sir. Something strange is<br>
    going on... there are violent<br>
    disruptions in the atmosphere...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign... increase to warp eight.</p>
  <p> Picard stares at the viewscreen, his instincts telling<br>
    him that something is amiss on Melona.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 8/14/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>19 INT. MELONA - CAVE FRONT - MINUTES LATER</p>
  <p> Riker is herding the last of the colonists into the<br>
    caverns; behind him, the sound of the wind is fearful,<br>
    and bursts of white light frequently illuminate him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Inside... keep moving, deep into<br>
    the cave...</p>
  <p> Finally the last of the colonists is inside and Riker<br>
    follows quickly.</p>
  <p>20 INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker and Data at the entrance; Beverly and the others<br>
    in b.g. as she does a cursory medical inspection.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How much protection will this cave<br>
    give us, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The presence of refractory metals<br>
    in the rock formations may act<br>
    as an effective barrier.</p>
  <p> There is a THUMP and a brilliant flash of light at the<br>
    entrance -- the Entity is homing in on them. Riker<br>
    draws his phaser.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's seal this entrance.</p>
  <p> He and Data fire at boulders above the cave opening;<br>
    they tumble down, blocking it. Beverly approaches.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I hope there's enough air in here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There should be a ventilation<br>
    source somewhere...</p>
  <p> They finish sealing off the entrance. It's now dark in<br>
    the cave. The fearful THUMPS continue, jarring the<br>
    walls like minor earthquakes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We need some light in here...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> They train phasers against some of the rocks along the<br>
    cave walls, and they begin to GLOW, providing<br>
    illumination.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How are the others?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    So far it looks like scrapes and<br>
    bruises. Will... where's Carmen?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Carmen didn't make it.</p>
  <p> She gives Riker a glance, but he is stoic.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    She went back for someone... a<br>
    man who'd fallen...</p>
  <p> He breaks off; the rest is obvious.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> He turns and strides toward the huddled, fearful group<br>
    in the cave.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think we'll be safe in here.<br>
    I'm not sure about our air supply.<br>
    Stay put and don't move around,<br>
    don't expend unnecessary energy.<br>
    With any luck we can wait this<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> There are several more THUMPS; a child begins crying.<br>
    Beverly continues her ministrations to the injured.<br>
    Riker turns and taps his badge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Riker to Enterprise... Riker to<br>
    Enterprise...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 8/14/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> He sits along a cave wall, and Data joins him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander, the refractory metals<br>
    in the rock strata might also<br>
    interfere with communication.</p>
  <p> The THUMPS recede in intensity, as though the Entity<br>
    were looking for another way in.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data... we've only seen the<br>
    Crystalline Entity once before...<br>
    how do you know these metals will<br>
    protect us?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am not entirely certain they<br>
    will.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's what I was afraid you were<br>
    going to say...</p>
  <p> And there is a huge THUMP which says the being is still<br>
    out and trying to get at them.</p>
  <p>21 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at warp.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - REV. 8/2/91 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>22 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> as before, Picard in his chair, taut as a coiled<br>
    spring.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir... the disturbance on Melona<br>
    is becoming more intense.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Continue hailing the colony.<br>
    All channels.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain... the fact that they're<br>
    not responding doesn't necessarily<br>
    mean there's anything wrong. The<br>
    atmospheric disturbance could be<br>
    jamming the signal.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know, Counselor.</p>
  <p> But Troi has known the captain long enough to respect<br>
    his instincts -- and those clearly tell him something<br>
    is wrong.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Still no response, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign, increase to warp nine.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    How long, Mister Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Six hours.</p>
  <p>23 INT. MELONA CAVE - LATER</p>
  <p> Some hours have passed. Everyone (except Data) is<br>
    having trouble breathing now. They're warm,<br>
    sweat-stained, clothing in disarray. The thumps are<br>
    not heard now. Beverly moves toward Riker.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Commander... I have one man<br>
    unconscious. We can't stay in<br>
    here much longer...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If I open that entrance and it's<br>
    still out there, we're dead.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If we stay here we'll be dead...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It has been over an hour since<br>
    we heard the Entity. It may be<br>
    gone.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And it may be out there waiting<br>
    for us.</p>
  <p> Suddenly there is a noise at the entrance -- a kind of<br>
    a thumping, prolonged, and then a point of sunlight<br>
    breaks through the rock and earth sealing the cave.<br>
    Riker gets to his feet, moves toward it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Everybody stay back.</p>
  <p> Phaser raised, he stands, ready to make a stand,<br>
    however futile, against the Entity. There is more<br>
    thumping... the hole widens... something moves to cover<br>
    it... Riker tenses... prepares to shoot... then...</p>
  <p>24 WORF'S FACE</p>
  <p> appears in the cave opening.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Commander?</p>
  <p>25 ANGLE - RIKER</p>
  <p> as he breaks into a relieved grin.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lieutenant Worf... I don't think<br>
    I've ever seen a more beautiful<br>
    sight.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - REV. 8/6/91 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The hole widens quickly as Riker and Data help from<br>
    within; the happy colonists rise and move forward.<br>
    Worf is first through the opening, followed by Geordi<br>
    and ND SECURITY PERSONNEL.</p>
  <p> Geordi looks around at the disheveled party.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Good to see you're all right,<br>
    Commander. What's happened here?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Crystalline Entity paid us<br>
    a visit. We lost two colonists<br>
    but got the rest in here...</p>
  <p> Geordi looks toward the opening and Riker moves to it,<br>
    peers out.</p>
  <p>26 MELONA - RIKER'S POV (MATTE)</p>
  <p> is dead. There's nothing but dust and a few gnarled<br>
    skeletal remains of what had been trees, bushes, and<br>
    vines.</p>
  <p>27 RIKER AND GEORDI</p>
  <p> as Riker withdraws from the opening, stunned by what<br>
    he's seen.</p>

    Captain's log, stardate 45122.3.<br>
    We have notified Starfleet Command<br>
    of our intention to pursue and<br>

    Entity. To that end, we have been<br>
    joined...</p>
  <p>29 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker and a TRANSPORTER CHIEF wait, facing the<br>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    ... by Doctor Kila Marr, a<br>
    xenologist who has made studying<br>
    the Entity her life's work.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR KILA MARR, a handsome, middle-aged female human,<br>
    MATERIALIZES. Riker steps forward.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Welcome to the Enterprise. I am<br>
    Commander William Riker.</p>
  <p> She looks at him curiously as she steps off the pad.<br>
    She is a pleasantly soft-spoken woman, friendly and<br>
    gracious though a bit reserved.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Commander... Kila Marr.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're glad you're here.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    You were on the surface... during<br>
    the attack.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's right.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - REV. 8/2/91 - ACT TWO 16.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Remarkable. You and your group<br>
    are the only beings ever known<br>
    to survive an assault by the<br>
    Crystalline Entity.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We were lucky.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    I should say.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And... your android. He was<br>
    there, too?</p>
  <p> Riker reacts to the dismissive term &quot;your android,&quot;<br>
    but stays diplomatically cool.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lieutenant Commander Data was<br>
    there, yes.</p>
  <p> She eyes him briefly, as though to pursue, but then<br>
    smiles.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Well. Shall we get started?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'd be happy to show you to your<br>
    quarters --</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Commander, the chance to talk to<br>
    survivors... this soon after an<br>
    attack... I've been waiting years<br>
    for this. I don't want to waste<br>
    a moment more.</p>
  <p> Riker inclines his head, gestures her through the<br>
    doors.</p>
  <p>30 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Data, Beverly, and Troi are at the<br>
    table; Doctor Marr paces.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    ... and when we came out of the<br>
    cave... there was nothing left.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - REV. 8/6/91 - ACT TWO 16A.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (cont'd)<br>
    Everywhere we looked... there was<br>
    just complete devastation... trees<br>
    gone... nothing...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - REV. 8/6/91 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    That's typical. It could take<br>
    years for anything to grow again.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor, I ran a full<br>
    spectrographic analysis, section<br>
    by section. Trace elements<br>
    confirm that it was the same<br>
    entity which destroyed the colony<br>
    on Omicron Theta.</p>
  <p> Doctor Marr pays absolutely no attention to Data,<br>
    continuing as though he hasn't spoken. Troi notices<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    The Crystalline Entity seems to<br>
    function like a giant<br>
    electromagnetic collector. It<br>
    needs a lot of power to keep<br>
    going... so it strips every form<br>
    of life from the worlds it<br>
    encounters and converts it all<br>
    into energy.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There was no vegetation left...<br>
    no insects. Not even soil<br>
    bacteria. It left nothing.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Except witnesses. For the first<br>
    time in eleven recorded attacks.</p>
  <p> She looks around the table.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Why, I wonder... did it spare your<br>
    group?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It didn't spare everyone, Doctor.</p>
  <p> There is a vehemence in his voice which Picard notices.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If you'll check your reports,<br>
    you'll find that two of the<br>
    colonists didn't survive.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    My point is that until now there<br>
    have never been any survivors.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor, the cave in which we hid<br>
    was carved from rock which<br>
    possessed heavy concentrations<br>
    of kelbonite and fistrium. We<br>
    surmise that the Entity could not<br>
    penetrate that barrier.</p>
  <p> Again, Doctor Marr takes no notice of Data. Troi takes<br>
    note; Data is merely puzzled.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    I'd like to do interviews with<br>
    each of the survivors. Collect<br>
    as much specific detail as I can<br>
    of their observations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    And I want to inspect the remains<br>
    of Melona Colony as soon as<br>
    possible.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander Data, you will accompany<br>
    the Doctor to the surface.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. We can leave --</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    If you don't mind, Captain, I'd<br>
    prefer to choose my own team.</p>
  <p> Picard eyes her. He, too, has seen the pointed<br>
    dismissal of Data by the doctor, and he needs to assert<br>
    control of the situation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There is no one on this ship who<br>
    is more knowledgeable of the<br>
    Crystalline Entity than Commander<br>
    Data. His birthplace was Omicron<br>
    Theta.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    I am aware of his origins. I am<br>
    very much aware that his<br>
    &quot;brother,&quot; Lore, worked with the<br>
    Crystalline Entity, and led it<br>
    to Omicron Theta -- where it<br>
    killed every living thing.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I don't think it's unreasonable<br>
    that I would prefer to make<br>
    another choice.</p>
  <p> The woman's implication about Data is startling to the<br>
    group, and the atmosphere becomes a little charged.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If there are others you wish to<br>
    have on your team, you are, of<br>
    course, welcome to request their<br>
    additional presence.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But as captain, I think it is in<br>
    the best interest of this<br>
    investigation for you and<br>
    Commander Data to work together.</p>
  <p> He stands, signaling that the meeting is over. A flush<br>
    comes to Doctor Marr's cheeks, but she is coolly<br>
    professional.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    As you wish, Captain.</p>
  <p> She collects her things, gives a curt nod to Data, and<br>
    they and the others -- except Troi -- EXIT the room.<br>
    Picard moves to Troi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't think you need an empath<br>
    to sense that woman's feelings.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> TROI (cont'd)<br>
    There's hostility... that she<br>
    seems to have transferred from<br>
    Lore... to Data...</p>
  <p> Picard's look shows his concern about this.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Perhaps you shouldn't have forced<br>
    her together with Data so soon.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If her discomfort is going to<br>
    cloud her judgement... or preclude<br>
    her doing her objective best...<br>
    I want to find it out now.</p>
  <p> He nods toward Troi and EXITS, leaving her ruminating<br>
    about the woman's strong reaction toward Data.</p>
  <p>31 EXT. MELONA COLONY - INSIDE CAVE - DAY</p>
  <p> Doctor Marr and SEVERAL TECHNICIANS roam the area with<br>
    tricorders. Some of them collect samples of dust, etc.<br>
    in (24th-century) glassine bags. Data ENTERS, carrying<br>
    a tricorder. In spite of Doctor Marr's sublime<br>
    indifference, he is gamely hanging in there, trying<br>
    to do his job.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor, there is evidence of<br>
    residual bitrious matter in the<br>
    soil. It was not present before<br>
    the Entity's attack.</p>
  <p> Doctor Marr ignores him, keeps on doing what she's<br>
    doing. Data regards her for a moment, then plunges in.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor Marr... you have made it<br>
    quite clear that you are disturbed<br>
    by my presence. However, I do<br>
    not believe that we can accomplish<br>
    the task we have been assigned<br>
    if you continue to ignore me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Still involved in her work, she does not immediately<br>
    answer. Finally she takes a breath, turns and faces<br>
    Data and -- for the first time -- addresses him<br>
    directly.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Commander... I hear everything<br>
    you say to me. If there is<br>
    anything worth my response, you<br>
    can be sure I will not be silent.</p>
  <p> Marr's attitude is purely a puzzlement to Data. In his<br>
    inability to feel the hostility, he innocently keeps<br>
    going.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then I do not understand your lack<br>
    of interest in the bitrious<br>
    filaments I mentioned.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    It's old news to me. I found<br>
    evidence of bitrium in three<br>
    separate attack sites. It seems<br>
    to be a residual element the<br>
    Entity produces after it absorbs<br>
    living matter.</p>
  <p> She turns away, looking in toward the cave depths.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    I'm actually more interested in<br>
    this cave.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm still amazed that your group<br>
    was spared.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    As I have speculated, the presence<br>
    of refractory --</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    -- refractory metals. Yes, I<br>
    know.</p>
  <p> And she strides deeper into the cave. Data follows.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>32 INT. CAVE - ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Doctor Marr runs a tricorder around the walls of the<br>
    cave.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    On two other occasions settlers<br>
    sought refuge in caves. Some of<br>
    them deeper underground than this<br>
    one. They perished anyway.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (studying his own<br>
    tricorder)<br>
    Were those caves laced with<br>
    kelbonite or fistrium?</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    The tunnels on Forlat Three had<br>
    strong deposits of kelbonite, yes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then perhaps it is the combination<br>
    of the two metals which prevented<br>
    the Entity --</p>
  <p> She whirls on him, feelings pouring over.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Or maybe it was you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    I do not understand.</p>
  <p> She walks toward him slowly.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Maybe it was your presence which<br>
    made the Crystalline Entity pass<br>
    over the people in this cave.<br>
    Did that occur to you?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I cannot imagine what effect my<br>
    being here would have had --</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    If you had been in contact with<br>
    the Entity... if that's why Melona<br>
    was attacked... it surely wouldn't<br>
    have killed its -- ally.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are suggesting I lured it<br>
    here?</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Did you?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, Doctor.</p>
  <p> She eyes him accusingly. Data, puzzled, tries to<br>
    figure it out.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ah. Because Lore betrayed the<br>
    colonists on Omicron Theta, you<br>
    assume that I am capable of the<br>
    same behavior. But you are<br>
    mistaken, Doctor. My programming<br>
    is distinctly different from<br>
    Lore's.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Don't you understand? I'm<br>
    accusing you of collaborating with<br>
    that monster...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do understand. I am attempting<br>
    to explain to you that it is<br>
    impossible.</p>
  <p> She stares at him, bewildered and a bit frustrated by<br>
    his coolly rational response.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Amazing. You can't feel anything,<br>
    can you? Nothing I say to you<br>
    hurts you...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is true.</p>
  <p> She stares at him for a moment, then turns and begins<br>
    playing the tricorder over the cave walls once again.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    I'm getting a slight elevation<br>
    of monocaladium particulates in<br>
    this cave wall... are you making<br>
    note of that?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Doctor.</p>
  <p> A beat, as she studies the tricorder.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    My son died on Omicron Theta.</p>
  <p> She makes this statement in the same tone with which<br>
    she described the particulate reading.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    He was sixteen when the colony<br>
    was attacked.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    That's the reason I became an<br>
    expert on the Crystalline Entity.</p>
  <p> She continues to read the cave wall, as though it were<br>
    of much more fascination to her than what she is<br>
    saying.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    I've spent my life, studying it,<br>
    tracking it... hoping someday to<br>
    find it...</p>
  <p> She turns to him and looks him straight in the eye.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    And if I learn that you are<br>
    helping that thing in any way<br>
    whatsoever... I'll see to it<br>
    that you are disassembled --<br>
    piece by piece.</p>
  <p> Data stares at her, fascinated and confused by this<br>
    complicated woman.</p>

  <p>33 INT. ENGINEERING - A DAY LATER</p>
  <p> Doctor Marr, Geordi, and Data processing information.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay... we've input all the data<br>
    you collected on the surface...</p>
  <p> She moves to his station, carrying a PADD.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Just a minute, Commander... I have<br>
    some cellulose readings from soil<br>
    samples that weren't included...</p>
  <p> Reading the PADD, she expertly keys Geordi's controls.<br>
    He watches admiringly.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You handle that unit like a<br>
    veteran, Doctor.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    (with a smile)<br>
    One thing about spending your life<br>
    gathering information... you learn<br>
    your way around computers.</p>
  <p> She finishes inputting and studies the monitor. It<br>
    begins to scroll figures and text.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Hydrocarbons slightly elevated...<br>
    bitrious filaments in trace<br>
    amounts...</p>
  <p> As she reads, she becomes gradually deflated.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Lanthanides... nitrates... all<br>
    normal.</p>
  <p> Finally she looks up to the two, disappointment in her<br>
    face.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - REV. 8/6/91 - ACT THREE 26.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Nothing different. Everything<br>
    falls within the parameters I've<br>
    established at the other attack<br>
    sites.</p>
  <p> She sinks back, discouraged.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Did you expect different results<br>
    this time, Doctor?</p>
  <p> She does not look at him. She still seems to be<br>
    keeping him at a distance.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    I've never surveyed a site so soon<br>
    after the attack. I thought maybe<br>
    I'd find something new. Something<br>
    that would make a difference...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor... have you ever scanned<br>
    your samples for gamma radiation?</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    (a hint of<br>
    condescension)<br>
    Why would I do that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We are seeing high-energy<br>
    reactions that may show up in a<br>
    gamma scan...</p>
  <p> Geordi gets it immediately and begins tapping<br>
    instructions on his computer.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    a pattern -- a kind of marker the<br>
    Entity left behind. Good idea,<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> A beat as Doctor Marr considers. She is reluctant to<br>
    leap quickly at a suggestion from Data, and her voice<br>
    is tinged with skepticism as she speaks.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Frankly, I just don't see what<br>
    this will get us.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    If the Entity left a residual<br>
    trace of antiprotons in the<br>
    samples we collected, the gamma<br>
    radiation scan would reveal that.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data, I'm getting the readout now.</p>
  <p> Data moves to looks at Geordi's monitor, but Marr keeps<br>
    her distance, trying to keep her professional reserve<br>
    in spite of the conflicting emotions inside her. Maybe<br>
    Data is on to something... but she doesn't want to show<br>
    her eagerness. And of course, there's a bit of chagrin<br>
    that she had never thought of this.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If we try a logarithmic scale,<br>
    it will give us better resolution.</p>
  <p> Geordi taps instructions. Marr is dying to go look,<br>
    but won't let herself.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There, Data... see it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> He looks up at Doctor Marr.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Would you care to see what the<br>
    scan has produced, Doctor?</p>
  <p> A brief hesitation... for appearances. Then she moves<br>
    to the monitor, looks over Geordi's shoulder. For the<br>
    first time since we've met her, there is a hint of<br>
    excitement under her cool exterior.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    A sharp spike at ten KEV. And<br>
    another...<br>
    (looking up at them)<br>
    A pattern...</p>

  <p>33 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So we know the Entity leaves<br>
    antiprotons behind...</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    If it also deposits antiprotons<br>
    in space, as it travels... could<br>
    we detect them?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sure. The ship's lateral sensors<br>
    can be set for gamma radiation.</p>
  <p> Doctor Marr straightens, looks at them.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Well. Let's get to it, shall we?</p>
  <p> She turns and walks briskly out of the room. After a<br>
    brief beat, Data follows.</p>
  <p>33A INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as Marr and Data walk toward a turbolift.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    It seems I owe you thanks,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The thanks actually go to Doctor<br>
    Clendenning on Omicron Theta who<br>
    did the first experiments with<br>
    gamma scans.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    I've never read that... it wasn't<br>
    in any of his records...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct. But I possess<br>
    much of his knowledge. He was<br>
    working with new detectors before<br>
    the attack on Omicron Theta.</p>
  <p> They have reached the turbolift, and as they enter it,<br>
    she glances at him, a skeptical smile on her lips.</p>

  <p>33B INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    I'd heard that you had been<br>
    programmed with the experiences<br>
    of the colonists... but frankly<br>
    it's a little hard to believe.<br>
    (to Computer)<br>
    Bridge.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is true, Doctor. The contents<br>
    of their journals and logs were<br>
    transferred into my memory cells.<br>
    The man who created me also<br>
    experimented with scanning the<br>
    synaptic patterns of the<br>
    colonists' temporal lobes and<br>
    programming them into my neural<br>
    nets.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    (still skeptical)<br>
    You possess -- their thoughts?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    To some degree. Doctor Soong<br>
    hoped to provide me with an<br>
    amalgam of the colonists'<br>
    memories.</p>
  <p> Marr cocks her head, regards him as though studying<br>
    a scientific oddity.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Interesting.</p>
  <p> Then she turns forward once more and proceeds to ignore<br>
    him.</p>
  <p>33C CLOSE ON BRIDGE MONITOR - LATER</p>

  <p> Riker, Troi, and Worf at their posts; Picard is with<br>
    Data and Doctor Marr at an aft science station;<br>
    supernumeraries as needed.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    That's the same pattern we saw<br>
    in engineering.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you project a course from it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.<br>
    (at controls)<br>
    There are two possible<br>
    destinations. The Brechtian<br>
    Cluster and the Argos system.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is either populated?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Brechtian Cluster has two<br>
    inhabited planets.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign, set a course.</p>

  <p>34 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Captain, I've done some<br>
    preliminary estimates of the<br>
    firing pattern we'll need in order<br>
    to destroy the Entity. The photon<br>
    torpedoes will require some<br>
    reprogramming.</p>
  <p> She moves toward tactical with a PADD.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    With your permission, I'll give<br>
    the calculations to Lieutenant<br>
    Worf.</p>
  <p> Picard nods.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Reprogram the torpedoes, Mister<br>
    Worf.<br>
    (to Marr)<br>
    Let's just hope we don't have to<br>
    use them.</p>
  <p> She gives the PADD to Worf, turns back. She is clearly<br>
    caught off-guard.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    I beg your pardon?</p>
  <p> She has obviously had a strong reaction, but Picard is<br>
    not certain what button he has pushed. He tries to<br>
    explain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If it's possible to avoid firing<br>
    on it, I would hope that --</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    You aren't going to kill it?</p>
  <p> Picard looks around; given Marr's vehement reaction,<br>
    this suddenly seems like a very public place.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps you should join me in my<br>
    ready room.</p>
  <p> She eyes him, then nods curtly and precedes him down<br>
    the ramp to the room. Camera FINDS Riker, who has<br>
    watched this interchange with troubled eyes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>35 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Though surprised at Picard's position, Doctor Marr<br>
    nonetheless retains the mien of a scientist pursuing<br>
    the solution to a problem.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    I don't understand. Why are we<br>
    pursuing the Entity, if not to<br>
    destroy it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are not hunters, Doctor. Nor<br>
    is it our role to exact revenge.</p>
  <p> Marr regards him with a cool amusement.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    What do you propose? We track<br>
    it down... greet it warmly... and<br>
    ask if it would mind terribly not<br>
    ravaging any more planets?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not denying that it might<br>
    become necessary to fire on it.<br>
    But that would be a last resort.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Why? Why not just kill it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm going to try to talk to it.</p>
  <p> She stares at him as though he had spoken in tongues.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We know through our own experience<br>
    that our shields will protect us<br>
    from the Entity. As long as we<br>
    are in no danger, I will make<br>
    every effort to communicate.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    To what end?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If we can determine what its needs<br>
    are, we might find other sources<br>
    to supply it...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Its needs are to slaughter people<br>
    by the thousands... it's nothing<br>
    but a giant killing machine.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The sperm whale on Earth devours<br>
    millions of cuttlefish as it<br>
    prowls the ocean. It is not<br>
    evil... it is simply feeding.<br>
    The same may well be true of the<br>
    Crystalline Entity.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    That would be small comfort to<br>
    those who have died to feed it.<br>
    We're not talking about<br>
    cuttlefish... we're talking<br>
    about people.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There are those, Doctor, who would<br>
    argue that the Crystalline Entity<br>
    has as much right to be here as<br>
    we do.</p>
  <p> She regards him for a moment, as though deciding<br>
    whether to pursue the argument.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data has some theories<br>
    about how to communicate with the<br>
    Entity. Please confer with him.</p>
  <p> Doctor Marr holds his look, regarding him coolly for a<br>
    long moment -- as though she might say something else.<br>
    Finally, she nods and EXITS. Picard stares after her.<br>
    There is something unsettling about her unflappably<br>
    icy reserve.</p>

    guitar. He cradles it correctly, reading from sheet<br>
    music. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> He places the guitar in its stand as the door opens and<br>
    Doctor Marr ENTERS.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Am I disturbing you?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Not at all, Doctor.</p>
  <p> She enters, goes right to the point.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Commander... there's something<br>
    I want to say.</p>
  <p> He looks at her curiously. She continues, the words<br>
    coming out in her usual rational way.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    You have been helpful to me, and<br>
    kind. I repaid you with<br>
    accusations -- and I realize I<br>
    may have been wrong.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is gracious of you to say,<br>
    Doctor. But I have not been<br>
    injured by you.</p>
  <p> She regards him for a beat, then nods and sits.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Captain Picard has told me that<br>
    you have done work in trying to<br>
    establish communication with the<br>
    Entity.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is true. I have experimented<br>
    with producing vibrations in<br>
    crystal by means of graviton<br>
    pulses.</p>

    All right.</p>
  <p> Data sits, begins keying the controls. Doctor Marr<br>
    paces for a bit; clearly there's more on her mind than<br>
    design models. She looks at him... sees him looking at<br>
    her... she seems to make a decision, tries to appear as<br>
    reserved as ever.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Commander... just what kind of<br>

  <p>45A INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard is at his desk; the door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's still headed toward the<br>
    Brechtian Cluster. We've<br>
    reestablished our course.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>45A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well.</p>
  <p> Riker turns to leave, but --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    One more thing...</p>
  <p> Riker turns back.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Starfleet will notify Carmen<br>
    Davila's family of her death and<br>
    return her personal effects.<br>
    Would you care to include a<br>
    letter?</p>
  <p> Riker hesitates... the reminder has stirred feelings<br>
    he's tried to bury.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir. I'd like that.</p>
  <p> There is a silence and Riker makes no move to depart.<br>
    Picard looks up, curious.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Something more, Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Permission to speak freely, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've been thinking... maybe Doctor<br>
    Marr is right. Maybe we should<br>
    destroy the Entity.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And why do you think that?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's killed thousands. It will<br>
    undoubtedly keep on killing...<br>
    unless we stop it. I don't want<br>
    those deaths on my conscience.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>45A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard regards him... suspecting there's more to it<br>
    than that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you sure that's it? Or are<br>
    you being influenced by personal<br>
    feelings?</p>
  <p> Riker takes refuge in a certain indignation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    With all due respect, sir... I'm<br>
    not a raw cadet. I've lost people<br>
    on missions before.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Carmen was a good friend. But<br>
    that's not why I'm saying this.</p>
  <p> He moves toward Picard, emphatic.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If we take the time to try to<br>
    communicate with this thing, we<br>
    may lose our chance to destroy<br>
    it. And I don't think we can risk<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't answer. Riker holds his eye.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>45A CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm going to write that letter<br>
    to Carmen's family.</p>
  <p> He EXITS, leaving Picard to ponder his words.</p>
  <p>46 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS - LATER</p>
  <p> Data and Doctor Marr.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We should program the bridge<br>
    science station to vary the<br>
    emissions we direct toward the<br>
    Entity.</p>
  <p> Marr takes a seat at Data's computer, begins tapping<br>
    instructions.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    I'll write a subroutine that will<br>
    allow us to change the frequency<br>
    of the graviton beam.</p>
  <p> She types expertly, entering commands. As she does...<br>
    almost as an afterthought...</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Data... you told me you carried<br>
    some of my son's memories...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is true.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Doctor Marr continues typing as though it held the main<br>
    focus of her concentration. When she speaks, it is<br>
    with studied casualness.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    What can you tell me about Renny?<br>
    What were those thoughts? Was<br>
    he -- was he happy at all, on<br>
    Omicron Theta?</p>
  <p> There is a brief hesitation as Data accesses those<br>
    memories.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I possess some vivid memories of<br>
    sporting events... he played<br>
    Parrises Squares with a group of<br>
    his schoolmates...</p>
  <p> She smiles, but continues with the computer, focusing<br>
    on it... as though her discussion of her son is nothing<br>
    more than small talk to fill the time.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Renny started Parrises Squares<br>
    when he was young... too young,<br>
    really... but the older children<br>
    kept asking him to join in and<br>
    I couldn't keep him away. He just<br>
    had this natural gift...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He was pleased to have won a<br>
    championship emblem.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    I remember... he wrote me about<br>
    that... he was so proud...</p>
  <p> She glances up at Data.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    I'm characterizing pulse width<br>
    in nanoseconds... sound right to<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Doctor.</p>
  <p> She returns to her task.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Your son's most intense thoughts<br>
    seemed to revolve around a young<br>
    woman named Janina...</p>
  <p> Doctor Marr smiles at this.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    A girlfriend? I never knew about<br>
    that... of course, that would be<br>
    the last thing he'd tell his<br>
    mother... What was she like?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He enjoyed her... gentleness...<br>
    her kindness... her...<br>
    (struggles to find<br>
    neutral words)<br>
    ... her -- physical attributes...</p>
  <p> Doctor Marr almost laughs... she is genuinely delighted<br>
    to be hearing these details about her son.</p>
  <p> She finishes inputting, sits back.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    There. Now we'll be able to vary<br>
    all the parameters directly from<br>
    the bridge.</p>
  <p> She looks briefly at Data... makes a decision... rises<br>
    and goes to him.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Could you... do something for me?<br>
    It would mean a lot...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I would be happy to be of help.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    You see... all I have left of<br>
    Renny, my only connection to<br>
    him... is there, inside you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And I was wondering... if you<br>
    could talk to me in his voice.</p>
  <p> Data looks puzzled by this.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - REV. 8/2/91 - ACT FOUR 48.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    I know you have the ability to<br>
    sound like other people. Isn't<br>
    that right?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, that is correct. But what<br>
    would you want me to say?</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Maybe... something from his<br>
    journals...</p>
  <p> Data considers this for a moment, while accessing his<br>
    memory files.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Many of his journal entries took<br>
    the form of letters to his<br>
    friends and family. I could<br>
    access one of those.</p>
  <p> She nods and turns away from him, hands clenched,<br>
    awaiting this moment with almost unbearable<br>
    anticipation. When Data speaks, it is in the voice<br>
    of an adolescent boy.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (as Renny)<br>
    I took my last exam today... I<br>
    think I did all right on<br>
    everything except cellular<br>
    biology. I know you think it's<br>
    important, Mom... but I don't see<br>
    how I'm ever gonna use this stuff.</p>
  <p> Doctor Marr's hands are clapsed together tightly as<br>
    she listens.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (as Renny)<br>
    In a couple of weeks, a bunch of<br>
    us are going on an archaeological<br>
    dig in the mountains. The Wallaces<br>
    said it would be okay with them<br>
    as long as we have adult<br>
    supervision... so don't worry<br>
    -- they're watching out for me.<br>
    They're really great people...<br>
    I like them a lot.<br>

    But they're kind of serious...<br>
    They don't have your sense of<br>
    humor, Mom.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I miss you.</p>
  <p> Doctor Marr doesn't speak. As she listens to these<br>

    Captain's Log, stardate 45125.7.<br>
    We are still in pursuit of the<br>
    Crystalline Entity. Data and<br>
    Doctor Marr are prepared to<br>
    attempt communication with the<br>
    being when we intercept it. I<br>
    will admit to some uncertainty<br>
    about the prospect... it could<br>
    prove to be a scientific<br>
    triumph... or a catastrophe.</p>
  <p>49 INT. BRIDGE</p>

    Sir, the Brechtian Cluster is now<br>
    five light years away.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are we still picking up the<br>
    Entity's pattern?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Commander. But sensors do<br>
    not yet have a lock on its exact<br>
    whereabouts.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Captain, we are reasonably certain<br>
    it's between here and the<br>
    Brechtian Cluster. If I start<br>
    emitting the graviton beam now,<br>
    it may act as a lure... a kind<br>
    of beacon.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> Marr and Data begin keying controls.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Commencing graviton emission<br>
    now...</p>
  <p> There is a brief silence, as all on the bridge wait<br>
    tensely for results.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No change in the sensor readings.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Let's ramp the frequency.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Emissions now at ten pulses per<br>
    second.</p>
  <p> Again, the charged silence. Then, Worf reacts to<br>
    something on his controls.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir...</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    What is it? Do you have<br>
    something?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A large mass... approaching at<br>
    warp speed...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Full stop. Doctor Marr, continue<br>
    emitting your signal. On screen,<br>
    Mister Worf.</p>
  <p>50 ANGLE - VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Nothing yet but the starfield. The crew on the bridge<br>
    stare at it, rapt, waiting for the first indication<br>
    that they have again encountered the mysterious<br>
    Crystalline being. A beat. Still nothing... and then,<br>
    a tiny white spot... approaching rapidly...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; - 7/31/91 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>51 ON DOCTOR MARR</p>
  <p> looking at the screen. This is what she has been<br>

  <p>52 ANGLE - VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Shields up.</p>
  <p> The Crystalline Entity is approaching... looming larger<br>
    and larger... Doctor Marr is staring, transfixed...</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    It's beautiful...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor... shall we change the<br>
    frequency?</p>
  <p> She looks at him, as though coming out of a trance.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Yes... yes, Commander. Proceed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Changing to twenty pulses per<br>
    second...</p>
  <p> And as he makes the changes... the Entity glides to<br>
    a stop. It hangs there, in space, a magnificent and<br>
    ominous being, overwhelming in its pristine, faceted<br>
    beauty.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's it doing? Checking us out?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Possibly... just as we are<br>
    checking it out.</p>
  <p> Then, the Entity does something quite remarkable. It<br>
    turns, slowly, in space... a kind of enigmatic<br>
    pirouette, fascinating in its lumbering grace.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Is it... responding to us?</p>
  <p> DOCTOR MARR<br>
    Let's test that. Ramp the<br>
    frequency again, Commander...</p>

    It's working... that's a response<br>
    to our signal...</p>
  <p> Now the Entity begins to slide, from side to side...<br>
    then turning in a circle... almost like a kitten that<br>
    is being teased and tickled...</p>

    Captain, there is a pattern<br>

    Then it's possible...<br>
    communication... understanding...</p>

    Let me try something else... a<br>
    continuous graviton beam.</p>
  <p> She bends to the controls, keys in instructions.</p>
  <p> Now, the Crystalline Entity exhibits different<br>
