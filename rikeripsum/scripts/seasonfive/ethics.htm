  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> In orbit around a planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45587.3.<br>
    We are picking up a consignment<br>
    of chlorinide from Starbase<br>
    Twenty-seven for transportation<br>
    to the Mylaira system. Once we<br>
    have delivered this material, we<br>
    will investigate reported subspace<br>
    anomalies in the Kelnaria region.</p>
  <p>2 INT. CARGO BAY</p>
  <p> WORF and GEORDI are scanning some LARGE CARGO<br>
    CONTAINERS with tricorders. There are other N.D.<br>
    CREWMEMBERS in the b.g. checking the containers as<br>
    well. The containers have been stacked in an intricate<br>
    framework of metal support beams, pallettes, and<br>
    lattices which reaches to the ceiling and almost<br>
    completely fills the room.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    No question. She was bluffing.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Bluffing is not one of Counselor<br>
    Troi's strong suits.</p>
  <p> Geordi works his tricorder for a moment.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off tricorder, to Worf)<br>
    I'm still reading some chlorinide<br>
    leakage, but I can't pin it down.</p>
  <p> Worf frowns at his tricorder.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - 12/09/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (points to different<br>
    section)<br>
    Maybe over there...</p>
  <p> They move to another section of containers and Geordi<br>
    crawls up in the lattice work to take some more<br>
    readings.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It would have been unwise to<br>
    call. My hand was not strong<br>
    enough.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You had jacks and eights and<br>
    she bluffed you with a pair of<br>
    sixes.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (outraged)<br>
    Sixes!</p>
  <p> Worf fumes for a moment as Geordi climbs down from the<br>
    lattice. He suddenly looks at Geordi with suspicion.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    How do you know what I had?</p>
  <p> Geordi slowly smiles and then deliberately adjusts his<br>
    visor.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Let's just say... I had a special<br>
    insight into your cards.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts and Geordi chuckles.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off his look)<br>
    Hey, next time bring a deck that's<br>
    not transparent to infrared<br>
    light.</p>
  <p> Worf shakes his head slightly in disgust.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (with humor)<br>
    Don't worry, I only peek after<br>
    the hand is over.</p>
  <p> Geordi checks his tricorder one more time.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/13/91 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (frustrated, off<br>
    tricorder)<br>
    Still nothing. Well... I'll get<br>
    a dynoscanner and try again.</p>
  <p> Geordi moves to a different part of the bay.</p>
  <p>3 WORF</p>
  <p> scans the containers again. He moves closer to the<br>
    container structure...</p>
  <p>4 A CARGO CONTAINER</p>
  <p> high above Worf. There is a thin wisp of GAS LEAKING<br>
    from the container. The gas is MELTING part of the<br>
    support upon which the container is sitting...</p>
  <p>5 WORF</p>
  <p> Continues to scan the structure. He moves closer...</p>
  <p>6 THE CARGO CONTAINER</p>
  <p> The structural support GIVES WAY and the cargo<br>
    container starts to FALL.</p>
  <p>7 WORF</p>
  <p> hears the RUMBLE from above and starts to move out of<br>
    the way, but it's too late.</p>
  <p>8 WIDER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as the heavy containers COLLAPSE on top of Worf.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/13/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>9 INCLUDE GEORDI</p>
  <p> who turned around just in time to see the collapse.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Worf!</p>
  <p> Geordi and the other crewmembers rush over to Worf and<br>
    start to move the containers off of him. They lift one<br>
    container and find Worf unconscious. As Geordi hits<br>
    his communicator, PUSH IN on Worf's face.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (urgent, to<br>
    communicator)<br>
    La Forge to sickbay! Medical<br>
    emergency in cargo bay three!</p>
  <p> Hold for a beat on Worf's face...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>10 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Worf is lying on his back with his eyes closed. He is<br>
    dressed in a medical robe and is lying in one of the<br>
    diagnostic beds. NURSE OGAWA is standing over Worf.<br>
    After a beat, Worf moves slightly.</p>
  <p> Worf's eyes finally open and he looks around in<br>
    confusion. BEVERLY moves to stand on the other<br>
    side of him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What... happened?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The containers you were checking<br>
    fell on you. You're lucky to be<br>
    alive.</p>
  <p> Worf tries to sit up... then stops when he realizes<br>
    that he can't move his lower body.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/12/91 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will not attempt to leave<br>
    sickbay without your approval,<br>
    Doctor. The restraining field<br>
    is not necessary.</p>
  <p> Beverly and Ogawa exchange a look. Ogawa moves off to<br>
    give them a little more privacy. Worf looks up at<br>
    Beverly in confusion... what's going on here? Beverly<br>
    puts on her best bedside manner.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Worf... there is no restraining<br>
    field.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (objecting)<br>
    But I cannot move my legs.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I know.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You can't move because one of the<br>
    containers shattered seven of your<br>
    vertebrae... and crushed your<br>
    spinal cord.</p>
  <p> Worf is shocked and this is very difficult for Beverly,<br>
    but there's no way to sugar-coat it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm afraid... there's no way to<br>
    repair this kind of injury.</p>
  <p> On Worf as he realizes the full impact of what she's<br>
    saying...</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>11 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship still in orbit.</p>
  <p>12 INT. WORF'S SICKBAY ROOM</p>
  <p> Worf has been moved to a private room just off main<br>
    sickbay. There are several monitors, some medical<br>
    equipment, and a diagnostic bed. Worf is sitting up in<br>
    bed and has swung his legs over the side. His face is<br>
    a mask of determination as he carefully grips the side<br>
    of the bed and moves his feet down to the floor.</p>
  <p> Worf manages to get to a standing position, but it's<br>
    only by using his hands and arms to maintain an iron<br>
    grip on the bedframe. His legs are useless. He<br>
    struggles as he tries to will his legs to work.</p>
  <p>13 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As the doors OPEN and Beverly ENTERS. Worf wrenches<br>
    his body as he tries to move his legs, but the effort<br>
    causes him to lose his grip on the bed. Both legs fold<br>
    under his weight... Beverly rushes over to him and<br>
    catches him just in time. She helps him back into bed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/17/91 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I know what you're trying to do<br>
    and I understand why. But it's<br>
    important that you remain in bed.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Klingons do not... lie in bed.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    They do if they have extensive<br>
    internal injuries which need time<br>
    to heal.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The muscles in my legs will<br>
    atrophy unless they are used.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/17/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF (cont'd)<br>
    A vigorous program of exercise<br>
    will be necessary for a full<br>
    recovery.</p>
  <p> Beverly moves closer to him. Her tone is<br>
    compassionate, yet firm as she lays out the simple<br>
    truth to him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I understand that as a Klingon<br>
    this is difficult for you... but<br>
    you have to face your situation<br>
    as it really is... not as you want<br>
    it to be.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I've sent for a neurogeneticist,<br>
    but... you need to realize that<br>
    you'll probably never regain total<br>
    use of your legs.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - 12/09/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Worf looks away, unable to deny the facts away any<br>
    longer. A long beat passes.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    Leave me.</p>
  <p> Beverly moves toward the door... then stops.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Your son has been asking to see<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (forceful)<br>
    No. I will not have him see me<br>
    like this.</p>
  <p> Beverly almost argues with him... then decides against<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    All right.</p>
  <p> She EXITS to...</p>
  <p>14 INT. SICKBAY - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> The doors CLOSE behind Beverly after she ENTERS. She<br>
    pauses for a moment, depressed and anguished over<br>
    Worf's situation. She tries to shake off the<br>
    feeling... picks up a PADD and starts to work it.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Bridge to Doctor Crusher. The<br>
    Potemkin has arrived and Doctor<br>
    Russell is ready to transport<br>
    aboard.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to com)<br>
    I'm on my way.</p>
  <p> She heads for the exit.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>15 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE &amp; POTEMKIN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise and the Potemkin running side by side<br>
    while still in orbit. (STOCK)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - 12/09/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>16 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Beverly is waiting near the platform as the TRANSPORTER<br>
    TECHNICIAN works the console. DR. TOBY RUSSELL<br>
    MATERIALIZES. Doctor Russell is petite and her<br>
    features are delicate, doll-like. She has an easy and<br>
    friendly manner, but she tends to command a room and<br>
    is used to being center stage at any gathering.<br>
    Russell has a knack for settling instantly into her<br>
    environment, and she already seems very much at home.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Welcome aboard the Enterprise,<br>
    Doctor Russell. I'm Beverly<br>
    Crusher.</p>
  <p> They shake hands.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    A pleasure.<br>
    (to Technician)<br>
    I have some equipment aboard the<br>
    Potemkin. Please have it sent<br>
    to one of your medical labs.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Technician)<br>
    Send it to medlab four.</p>
  <p> The Technician nods and works the console. Russell<br>
    turns to Beverly with a warm smile and then takes<br>
    Beverly's arm as they begin to leave the transporter<br>
    room.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    (on the move)<br>
    Before we get down to business,<br>
    I just wanted to say that I had<br>
    the pleasure of reading your paper<br>
    on cybernetic regeneration<br>
    recently.</p>
  <p> They EXIT to...</p>
  <p>17 INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Russell and Beverly walk down the corridor. Russell<br>
    has definitely turned on the charm.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (pleased)<br>
    Really? You're the first person<br>
    to mention it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/10/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    Oh, I thought it was brilliant.<br>
    Your ideas on bioactive interfaces<br>
    border on revolutionary. It's going<br>
    to be a genuine pleasure working<br>
    with you.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Thank you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Have you had a chance to review<br>
    Worf's case history yet?</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    Only briefly. I must admit, I<br>
    was a little shocked to find the<br>
    state of Klingon neurological<br>
    medicine to be so... primitive.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's a cultural bias. When I<br>
    contacted the Klingon Medical<br>
    Division, I was told they usually<br>
    let the patient die in a case like<br>
    this... as a result they've done<br>
    almost no research on<br>
    neurological trauma.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    (with relish)<br>
    We'll be in uncharted waters.</p>
  <p> Beverly doesn't share Russell's anticipation, but she's<br>
    not bothered by it either.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Worf's been having a hard time<br>
    dealing with his injuries. He's<br>
    always been a difficult patient,<br>
    but now...</p>
  <p> They have arrived outside of sickbay and Beverly moves<br>
    to go inside. The doors OPEN.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He's a little tough to get along<br>
    with at first, but I think you'll<br>
    get to like him after---</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    Doctor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - 12/09/91 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Beverly stops in the doorway. Russell seems to<br>
    hesitate for a moment... then speaks in a soft and<br>
    understanding voice.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    I know that as a starship doctor,<br>
    you have to maintain close ties<br>
    with patients. But I think it<br>
    would be best if I maintain a<br>
    discreet distance. That way, I<br>
    can give you a completely<br>
    objective opinion regarding<br>
    treatment.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at her for a beat... decides that Russell<br>
    is making sense.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes... you're probably right.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    (warm smile)<br>
    Good. Well... I believe you said<br>
    I'll be working in medlab four?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes. This way.</p>
  <p> Beverly leads Russell down the corridor.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>18 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship in orbit.</p>
  <p>19 INT. WORF'S SICKBAY ROOM</p>
  <p> Worf is propped up in bed as RIKER ENTERS. Riker<br>
    forces himself to smile at his friend and try to put<br>
    him at ease.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You look pretty good for someone<br>
    who's been eating sickbay food<br>
    for three days.</p>
  <p> Worf makes a half-hearted attempt to return the smile,<br>
    then indicates a chair.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - 12/09/91 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Please sit down, Commander.</p>
  <p> Riker sits down. Worf is very uncomfortable and<br>
    embarrassed. He tries to sit a little straighter...<br>
    pulls the bedclothes up a little further on his chest.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Thank you for agreeing to see me<br>
    in... this condition.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf, I'm not Klingon... I don't<br>
    think there's any shame in being<br>
    injured.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am not merely injured... Doctor<br>
    Crusher believes my... paralysis<br>
    will be permanent.</p>
  <p> Riker takes a beat to take that in.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm... sorry.</p>
  <p> Worf looks away from Riker, not wanting to see any pity<br>
    in his face. This is very difficult for Worf, but he<br>
    tries to keep his voice as even and restrained as<br>
    possible.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have a personal favor to ask.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Name it.</p>
  <p> Long beat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I want you to assist me in<br>
    performing the... Hegh'bat<br>
    ceremony.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I want you to help me die.</p>
  <p> Riker recoils from the idea and looks at Worf with<br>
    shock.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/10/91 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    When a Klingon can no longer stand<br>
    and face his enemies as a<br>

    Worf, there have to be other<br>

  <p> Worf turns back and meets Riker's eyes.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (firm)<br>
    No, there are not.<br>
    (beat, then quieter)<br>
    I will not live as an object of...<br>
    pity... or shame. My life as a<br>
    Klingon is over.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I won't help a friend commit<br>
    suicide.</p>
  <p> Worf struggles... his voice drops down low as he makes<br>
    a direct appeal to Riker.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We have served together for many<br>
    years... fought side by side...<br>
    I know you to be a brave and<br>
    honorable man... if you truly<br>
    consider me your friend... help<br>
    me now... help me end my life as<br>
    I lived it... with dignity and<br>
    honor.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Please.</p>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>20 INT. MEDICAL LAB (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A room filled with medical equipment of every size and<br>
    description. Beverly and Russell are standing near<br>
    a large unit which is projecting a HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE<br>
    of Worf's back and spinal column in mid-air. Beverly<br>
    is pointing to the damaged vertebrae, which have been<br>
    highlighted.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The cortico-spinal tract has<br>
    continued to deteriorate over the<br>
    past seventy-two hours despite<br>
    CPK enzymatic therapy.</p>
  <p> Russell walks slowly around the hologram...<br>
    considering the injury from all angles.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    What about alkysine treatment?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Ineffective.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    Overdesigned.<br>
    (off Beverly's look)<br>
    Klingon anatomy... twenty-three<br>
    ribs, two livers, eight-chambered<br>
    heart, double-lined neural pia<br>
    mater... I've never seen so many<br>
    unnecessary redundancies in one<br>
    body.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Klingon medicine refers to it as<br>
    the brak'lul... almost every vital<br>
    function in their bodies has a<br>
    built-in redundancy in case the<br>
    primary organ or system fails.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/11/91 - ACT TWO 16.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    It's a good design in theory, but<br>
    in practice, all the extra organs<br>
    mean there's just that much more<br>
    that can go wrong.</p>
  <p> Russell glares at the hologram for a moment, then<br>
    turns to Beverly.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    Let me show you something.</p>
  <p> Russell leads Beverly over to a strange-looking piece<br>
    of medical equipment that has been moved into the lab<br>
    on a cart. It should be even more advanced than our<br>
    normal sickbay equipment.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    We've been experimenting with<br>
    DNA-based generators... this is<br>
    a genetronic replicator. It reads<br>
    the DNA coding of damaged organs,<br>
    translates that into a specific<br>
    set of replicant instructions and<br>
    then begins to &quot;grow&quot; a<br>
    replacement.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks over the odd equipment with curiosity.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've read some of the preliminary<br>
    work you've done... I thought this<br>
    was still in the experimental<br>
    stage.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/12/91 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Russell picks up a PADD and works it for a moment.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The early results have been very<br>
    encouraging...</p>
  <p> She hands the PADD to Beverly... who begins to glance<br>
    at it... Russell lets her read on for a moment... then<br>
    decides the time is right to push for her plan.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    Beverly, the genetronic replicator<br>
    can create a completely new neural<br>
    conduit for your Lieutenant Worf.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (a little shocked)<br>
    Replace his entire spinal column?</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    Exactly. Instead of splicing and<br>
    pasting together broken<br>
    connections like a couple of<br>
    glorified tailors, we create a<br>
    new, living system.</p>
  <p> Beverly takes a beat to consider this... she glances<br>
    down at the PADD in her hand... presses some buttons<br>
    to move the text forward... she has some serious<br>
    doubts.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (looking for the data)<br>
    I had no idea you were already<br>
    using this on humanoids...</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    I haven't been. This'll be the<br>
    first time.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    First time?</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    I've done dozens of holosimulations...<br>
    the success rate is up to <br>
    thirty-seven percent...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/12/91 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Thirty-seven percent... even a<br>
    holographic patient would balk<br>
    at those odds.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    Sooner or later it has to be tried<br>
    on a living patient.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We're talking about a spinal<br>
    column. Even to attempt it,<br>
    you'd have to remove his<br>
    existing spine. We don't know<br>
    enough about Klingon neurological<br>
    medicine to reattach it. If<br>
    something goes wrong, he'll die.</p>
  <p> Beverly sets the PADD down and regards Russell<br>
    seriously.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I agree it has remarkable<br>
    potential but it's still in the<br>
    most preliminary stages of research.<br>
    We can't possibly justify the risk<br>
    to Worf. I'm afraid we'll just<br>
    have to make do with the more<br>
    conventional approaches.</p>
  <p> Russell almost continues to fight... then seems to<br>
    reconsider. She smiles slightly at Beverly.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    You're probably right. It's too<br>
    radical an approach.</p>
  <p> Beverly is relieved that Russell isn't going to push<br>
    for this approach, but that doesn't solve their<br>
    problem.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've always tried to keep an open<br>
    mind... not to judge someone<br>
    else's culture by my own... but<br>
    for me to be a part of this<br>
    &quot;ceremony&quot;...</p>
  <p> Riker trails off and Picard waits for a beat before<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    That doesn't mean his life is<br>
    over.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's a very... Human<br>
    perspective, Will. But to any<br>
    Klingon in Worf's position...<br>
    life is over.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can't accept that.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a beat... looks out the window for a<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you were dying... terminally<br>
    ill from a disease for which there<br>
    was no cure... and the few<br>
    remaining days of your life would<br>
    be spent in pain. Don't you think<br>
    that you might come to see death<br>
    as... a release?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf isn't dying and he's not in<br>
    pain... he can live a long life<br>
    without---</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (firm)<br>
    You or I could learn to live with<br>
    a disability of this kind. But<br>
    to Worf... his life ended when<br>
    those containers fell on him.<br>
    We don't have to agree with it...<br>
    we don't have to understand it...<br>
    but we do have to respect his<br>
    beliefs.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (repeating for emphasis)<br>
    I can respect his beliefs, but<br>
    Worf wants me to take an active<br>
    role in ending his life.</p>

    He asked for your help because<br>
    you're his friend. That means<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Which leaves me right back where<br>
    I started.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry, Will. I can't make this<br>
    decision for you... but I can tell<br>
    you that Klingons choose their<br>
    friends with great care. If Worf<br>

  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Why won't you let me see him?</p>

    Alexander, I told you it's not<br>
    my decision. Your father doesn't<br>
    want to---</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I don't believe you. My father<br>
    wants to see me. You're the one<br>
    keeping me away from him!</p>
  <p> Troi regards him coolly for a beat... refusing to get<br>
    into a shouting match with this kid. Her voice is calm<br>
    and assured.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I think you know that's not true.</p>
  <p> Alexander's anger recedes a little in the face of<br>
    Troi's serene visage. His voice becomes somewhat less<br>
    strident.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/16/91 - ACT TWO 23.</p>

  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Then why can't I see him?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Your father is going through a<br>
    very difficult time. He needs<br>
    to be alone for now.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    But why?</p>
  <p> Troi moves to a couch and motions to Alexander, who<br>
    sits with her after a beat. Troi keeps her voice calm<br>
    and soothing as she tries to reassure the boy.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He's been injured, Alexander, and<br>
    he's... embarrassed. To have<br>
    anyone see him now would make him<br>
    feel worse... even if it were<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> Alexander thinks about this for a beat.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    This is part of that Klingon<br>
    stuff, isn't it?<br>

    My mother always said that<br>
    Klingons had a lot of dumb ideas<br>
    about honor.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Alexander, that... &quot;Klingon stuff&quot;<br>
    is very important to your father.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    (hurt)<br>
    Well, it isn't very important to<br>
    me. I don't care about being<br>
    Klingon, I just want to see my<br>
    father.</p>
  <p> It's obvious that Alexander is exhausted... this whole<br>
    experience has been very draining for him. Troi moves<br>
    to him and her voice becomes softer, more soothing.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's been a long day... why don't<br>
    you get ready for bed and we'll<br>
    talk about this again in the<br>
    morning.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    You know why I left those<br>
    instructions.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes I do. It's not the &quot;Klingon&quot;<br>
    way, right?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is a question of honor, and<br>
    I would ask you to respect my<br>
    wishes in this matter, Counselor.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    All I care about at this moment<br>
    is a little boy who's terrified<br>
    he's going to lose his father.</p>
  <p> Beverly and Russell ENTER. Troi glances at them...<br>
    leans down and fixes Worf with a hard look.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (quiet, but firm)<br>
    Maybe it's time you stopped lying<br>
    around here worrying about your<br>
    honor... and began thinking about<br>
    someone else... like your son.</p>
  <p> Troi turns and EXITS. Beverly and Russell exchange a<br>
    look... what was that all about?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    No. Come in, Doctor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    This is Doctor Toby Russell from<br>
    the Adelman Neurological Institute.<br>
    She specializes in spinal injuries<br>
    like yours.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Russell)<br>
    Doctor.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    Lieutenant. Doctor Crusher has<br>
    been updating me on your case.<br>
    We'd like to talk to you about<br>
    some of your options.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Please proceed.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We've discussed a variety of<br>
    surgical procedures... I'm afraid<br>
    none of them would be able to<br>
    repair the spinal cord. But we<br>
    do have a way for you to regain<br>
    most of your mobility.</p>
  <p>27 INCLUDE MONITOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Beverly moves to the monitor and activates the screen.<br>
    A diagram of Worf's body comes up with SEVERAL IMPLANTS<br>
    highlighted on the schematic.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (indicating monitor)<br>
    We can implant a series of neural<br>
    transducers in your lower torso<br>
    and legs. They're designed to<br>
    pick up the electrical impulses<br>
    from your brain and then stimulate<br>
    the corresponding muscles. With<br>
    a little work, you'll eventually<br>
    regain sixty to seventy percent<br>
    of your motor control.</p>
  <p> Russell picks up two motor assist bands (about the size<br>
    and shape of a dog collar and as seen in<br>
    &quot;Transfigurations&quot;).</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/16/91 - ACT TWO 27.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    The first step would be to fit<br>
    your legs with motor assist units<br>
    like these.</p>
  <p> Russell places the band around Worf's right leg.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    They're a training device... once<br>
    you've mastered using them, we<br>
    can move on to the implants. Now,<br>
    try to move your leg.</p>
  <p> Worf looks down at his leg for a moment... then watches<br>
    in horror as it suddenly jerks and spasms. Neither<br>
    Beverly nor Russell seem at all concerned about this.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's good for a first try.<br>
    It'll take some time before you<br>
    get used to manipulating the---</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

    No.</p>
  <p> Worf rips the band from his leg.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will not live like that.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    These are very sophisticated<br>
    devices. With enough time, they<br>
    will give you--</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sixty percent of my mobility.<br>
    I will not be seen... lurching<br>
    through corridors like some<br>
    half-Klingon machine... an object<br>
    of ridicule and disgust.</p>
  <p> Beverly takes a beat, then moves closer to Worf. She<br>
    lowers her voice and makes a personal connection and<br>
    plea with her patient.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I understand how you feel... and<br>
    I know that right now, this all<br>
    sounds a little frightening...<br>
    but I think it's important that<br>
    you take your time before making<br>
    a decision. All I ask is that<br>
    you give this some thought.</p>
  <p> Worf keeps his expression neutral... but he doesn't<br>
    actually reject it. Beverly decides that's at least<br>
    something and she moves to leave. Russell makes no<br>
    move to follow her. Russell steps forward.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    There is one other option I'd like<br>
    you to consider... it's called<br>
    genetronic replication....</p>
  <p> Worf looks up. Beverly is surprised.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    It's still in the experimental<br>
    stage... but if it works, it will<br>

    There's a real chance this could<br>
    work. And if it does, it'll be<br>
    a major breakthrough in<br>
    neurogenetics that will change<br>
    a lot of people's lives.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're using the desperation of<br>
    an injured man as an excuse to<br>
    try a procedure you couldn't do<br>
    under normal circumstances. I<br>
    checked with Starfleet Medical<br>
    and they've refused your requests<br>
    to test genetronics on humanoids<br>
    three times already.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. We'll begin<br>
    transporting the casualties aboard<br>
    immediately. Bridge out.</p>
  <p> Russell looks at Beverly and gives her a small smile.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    Could you use an extra pair of<br>

  <p> Troi and Alexander ENTER. The boy is surprised to see<br>
    Worf standing by the bed. Worf is wearing the motor<br>
    assist bands on his legs and is standing very still<br>
    with one hand clamped to a table for support.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Father?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Come in, Alexander.</p>

  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    (confused)<br>
    Deanna said you hurt your back...<br>
    that you couldn't walk.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am... still struggling with my<br>
    injury.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I was worried about you.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We have much to talk about,<br>
    Alexander. There will be<br>
    difficult times ahead... you must<br>
    be strong.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I understand.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> Worf pauses for a moment to gather his thoughts.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - 12/09/91 - ACT THREE 33A.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    As Klingons, we must always be<br>
    prepared for any---</p>
  <p> Forgetting for a moment his precarious position, Worf<br>
    tries to shift his weight and suddenly FALLS to the<br>
    floor at Alexander's feet. The boy is horrified and<br>
    bends down to help his father along with Troi.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Father!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/20/91 - ACT THREE 34.</p>

  <p> Looks up at his son and feels humiliated.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Take him away.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf, let me help you---</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (harsh to Alexander)<br>
    Leave!</p>
  <p> Alexander takes a step back and looks at Troi. She<br>
    realizes that it would be best for him to leave.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Go on, Alexander. It'll be all<br>
    right. I'll take care of your<br>
    father.</p>
  <p> Alexander looks once more at his father and then runs<br>
    out of the room. Worf sags on the ground... he puts<br>
    his head down and his face burns with shame. Troi<br>
    knows that the best thing to do is to say nothing for<br>
    now, so she sits next to him in silence...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>36 INT. SHUTTLE BAY</p>
  <p> The bay has been converted into an emergency<br>
    hospital/triage center. The room is filled with a<br>
    variety of medical equipment, diagnostic beds, gurneys,<br>
    etc.</p>
  <p> There are MANY INJURED CREWMEMBERS &amp; CIVILIANS lying<br>
    on the deck or in the beds and they are being tended<br>
    to by DOCTORS, NURSES, and CIVILIAN MEDICS. People<br>
    are moving about quickly and efficiently and there is<br>
    a sense of urgency in the room.</p>
  <p> Beverly walks across the bay, pausing occasionally<br>
    to glance at this patient or that one. She's been<br>
    at this for a while.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/20/91 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>37 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Where we see Russell looking at an injured MAN who<br>
    is lying on a diagnostic bed with a sheet over his<br>
    head. Russell is running a scanner over his arm and<br>
    then places the arm back on his chest. The man is<br>
    dead. Russell goes to a monitor and studies an<br>
    Okudagram.</p>
  <p> Beverly comes over and sees the dead man. She picks<br>
    up a PADD sitting at the foot of the bed. Her attitude<br>
    is professional and there is no hint of recrimination<br>
    in her voice.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What happened here?</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    He went into neural metaphasic<br>
    shock.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    From leporazine? That's unusual.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    He couldn't take leporazine, his<br>
    blood pressure was too low. So<br>
    I had to try a different treament.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    A morathial series?</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    No. I tried a new rybotherapy<br>
    I've been working with. It's<br>
    called Borathium, and I've had<br>
    some very good results...</p>
  <p> Beverly is more surprised than angry. She has trouble<br>
    believing that Russell would actually do this.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You used this man for one of your<br>
    experiments?</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    Borathium is decades ahead of<br>
    leporazine or morathial.</p>
  <p> Beverly starts a slow burn.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Morathial would have saved his<br>
    life.</p>

  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    His injuries were so severe I<br>
    don't think any conventional<br>
    treatment could've saved him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The point is, you didn't even try<br>
    the standard treatments.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    I made the choice I thought gave<br>
    him the best chance of surviving.<br>
    (with a trace of<br>
    sarcasm)<br>
    Isn't that what you would have<br>
    done?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I think you took advantage of the<br>
    situation in order to test one<br>
    of your theories -- just like<br>
    you're trying to do with Worf.</p>
  <p> Russell eyes her briefly, moves a step closer.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    That's what this is really about,<br>
    isn't it? Lieutenant Worf. I'm<br>
    offering him the chance to recover<br>
    fully -- a chance you can't give<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What this is about is the kind<br>
    of medicine you seem to practice.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    I make no excuses about my<br>
    approach to medicine. I don't like<br>
    losing a patient any more than you<br>
    do. But I'm looking down a long<br>
    road, Doctor... this man didn't<br>
    die for nothing -- the data I<br>
    gathered was invaluable... it will<br>
    eventually help save thousands<br>
    of lives.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I doubt that will comfort his<br>
    family.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    Let me ask you this: if, some<br>
    years from now, Borathium therapy<br>
    were to save the life of someone<br>
    you loved... would you still<br>
    condemn me?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I won't get drawn into a<br>
    hypothetical argument, Doctor.<br>
    Your research on this ship is<br>
    over. You're relieved from all<br>
    medical duties until further<br>
    notice. Is that clear?</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    (ice)<br>
    Perfectly.</p>
  <p> The two doctors glare at each other for a moment, and<br>
    then Russell walks away. On Beverly's reaction...</p>

  <p> The ship in orbit.</p>
  <p>39 INT. WORF'S SICKBAY ROOM</p>
  <p> Worf is in bed as Beverly ENTERS. Her attitude is<br>
    warm, cheerful... this is Beverly at her best, caring<br>
    for a patient and trying to help him through a<br>
    difficult time, but Worf isn't going to make this easy<br>
    for her. His mind is obviously elsewhere.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Good morning.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Doctor.</p>
  <p> She checks the diagnostic monitor above the bed, then<br>
    checks his pulse herself and makes a couple of other<br>
    hands-on checks of his condition.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'd like to run a couple of tests<br>
    today... most of it is fairly<br>
    boring: blood work, molecular<br>
    studies, things like that.</p>
  <p> Worf doesn't react to the humor or light tone in<br>
    Beverly's voice. His mind is obviously elsewhere.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Why do you wish to do these tests?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I need the data for some<br>
    preparatory work I've been doing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/13/91 - ACT FOUR 38.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Work... on the implants?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Worf looks away and his expression hardens.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will not submit to the test.</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm not trying to pressure you...<br>
    but we need to have some of this<br>
    work done in case you change your<br>
    mind.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have made my decision. I wish<br>
    to die.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There are alternatives other than<br>
    full recovery and ending your<br>
    life. The use of neural implants<br>
    is only one of them.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am not interested.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    You haven't even heard me out.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - 12/09/91 - ACT FOUR 39.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No!<br>
    (beat, then quieter)<br>
    Leave me... please.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at him for a beat, but sees no point in<br>
    continuing this argument. She finally EXITS.</p>
  <p>39A INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Beverly ENTERS and sits down at her desk. She's had<br>
    a grueling couple of days and the previous scene with<br>
    Worf has only added to the strain. She picks up a PADD<br>
    and then tosses it back on the table in irritation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor?</p>
  <p> Beverly looks up in surprise to see Picard standing<br>
    in the doorway. Picard is quick to pick up on<br>
    Beverly's frustration and turmoil.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was on my way to look in on your<br>
    patient.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Be my guest... but don't expect<br>
    a lot of conversation, he's in<br>
    full Klingon mode: honorable,<br>
    strong... and closed-minded.</p>
  <p> Picard waits a beat... quietly changes the subject for<br>
    a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand you've relieved<br>
    Doctor Russell of duty.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's right. She's<br>
    irresponsible. I won't have her<br>
    practicing medicine on this ship.</p>
  <p> Picard sits down... adopts a more personal and intimate<br>
    tone.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Beverly... maybe you should<br>
    consider letting her go ahead with<br>
    the genetronic procedure.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/10/91 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p>39A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at him with astonishment. She's been<br>
    under a lot of stress and her anger and frustration<br>
    are very near the surface.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How can you say that? She has<br>
    a theory, based on a little<br>
    empirical data and a lot of<br>
    supposition...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If he can't make a full<br>
    recovery... Worf's going to kill<br>
    himself.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (firm)<br>
    Not in my sickbay, he's not. I'll<br>
    put him in a restraining field<br>
    and post security outside the door<br>
    before I let him commit suicide.</p>
  <p> Picard keeps his voice low and reasonable, letting<br>
    Beverly vent her emotions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long could you keep him like<br>
    that? A week... a month... a<br>
    year?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If I have to. Suicide is not an<br>
    option.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Setting aside for the moment the<br>
    fact that a paraplegic can live<br>
    a very full life, there is also<br>
    a conventional therapy that can<br>
    restore much of his mobility.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But not all of it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    No, not all of it! There are some<br>
    things I can't fix. Klingon or<br>
    not, he's got to accept that his<br>
    condition---</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/12/91 - ACT FOUR 40A.</p>
  <p>39A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard breaks in gently, but firmly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He can't make the journey you're<br>
    asking of him, Beverly.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You want him to go from<br>
    contemplating suicide to accepting<br>
    his condition and living with the<br>
    disability. But that's too far...<br>
    the road in between covers a<br>
    lifetime of values and beliefs...<br>
    he can't do it.</p>
  <p> Beverly leans back in the chair and rubs her eyes<br>
    briefly in fatigue and frustration... she's been having<br>
    the same argument with herself, and so far she hasn't<br>
    heard any good options. Picard continues after a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But perhaps he can come part of<br>
    the way... maybe he can be<br>
    persuaded to forgo the ritual...<br>
    in order to take a chance at<br>
    regaining the kind of life he<br>
    needs.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    A Klingon may not be able to<br>
    accept defeat... but he knows all<br>
    about taking risks.</p>
  <p> Beverly thinks about this for a beat... she's starting<br>
    to waver a little. Her next argument is not nearly<br>
    so forceful as her last.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Starfleet Medical has rejected<br>
    her proposals to use<br>
    genetronics on humanoids three<br>
    times.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If they were aware of all the<br>
    circumstances in this case...<br>
    don't you think it might affect<br>
    their decision?</p>
  <p> Beverly thinks for a long beat... she's not so sure<br>
    they wouldn't agree with Picard. She tries one last<br>
    argument.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/11/91 - ACT FOUR 40B.</p>
  <p>39A CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The first tenet of good medicine<br>
    is don't make the patient any<br>
    worse. Right now he's alive and<br>
    functioning... but if he goes<br>
    into this operation he'll probably<br>
    come away a corpse.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It may not be good medicine...<br>
    but for Worf, it may be the only<br>
    choice.</p>
  <p> Picard waits for another moment... then finally stands<br>
    and quietly EXITS, leaving Beverly with a great deal to<br>
    think about.</p>

  <p> Riker is carrying a cup of tea and sitting down at his<br>

  <p> Worf is lying in bed as Riker ENTERS. Riker is<br>
    carrying a Klingon ceremonial robe, a knife, and other<br>
    ceremonial objects. He puts them on the bed. Worf<br>
    reacts with surprise for a moment... he hadn't expected<br>
    Riker so soon. But he quickly composes himself and<br>
    then speaks with great formality.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am ready, Commander.</p>
  <p> Riker regards Worf for a moment. Riker's definitely<br>
    got a chip on his shoulder and a hardline attitude.<br>
    He's not here to meekly go along with this Klingon<br>
    business and it shows.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've been studying this ritual<br>
    of yours, and you know what I've<br>
    decided?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I think it's despicable.</p>
  <p> Worf is shocked by this blunt appraisal, but Riker<br>
    continues without waiting for some kind of response.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>

    I may have to respect your<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    It is not something I expect you<br>
    to understand.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No... All you really expect me<br>
    to do is bring you the knife and<br>
    then walk away, so you can kill<br>
    yourself in peace. Well, I'm not<br>
    going to make it that easy for<br>
    you.</p>

  <p> Worf looks away, not wanting to hear this.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And what about the Klingon Empire?<br>
    If you hadn't put yourself on the<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    (a shout)<br>
    Enough!</p>
  <p> Riker pulls back and there is a tense beat between the<br>
    two men. Riker has touched a nerve and Worf takes a<br>
    moment to restrain his emotions.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

    Will you, or will you not, help<br>
    me with the Hegh'bat?</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're my friend... and in spite<br>
    of everything I've said... if it<br>
    were my place, I'd probably help<br>
    you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I've been studying Klingon<br>
    law and ritual... and I discovered<br>
    that it's not my place to fill<br>
    that role.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    According to tradition, that honor<br>
    falls to a family member...<br>
    preferably the oldest son.</p>
  <p> Worf is surprised -- and not happy -- that Riker has<br>
    discovered this.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That is not possible. He is a<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    &quot;The son of a Klingon is a man<br>
    the day he can first hold a<br>
    blade.&quot; True?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Alexander is not fully Klingon...<br>
    he is part Human.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's an excuse. What you really<br>
    mean to say is that it would be<br>
    too hard for you to look at your<br>
    son and tell him that he must hand<br>
    you the knife... watch you stab<br>
    it into your heart... and then<br>
    pull the knife from your chest<br>
    and wipe the blood on his sleeve.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    That is the rite of death, isn't<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> Worf maintains a stony silence. Riker tosses the knife<br>
    back on the bed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sorry, Worf... but I can't<br>
    help you. There's only one<br>

    Doctor...</p>
  <p> Again Worf twitches, there is a burst on the screen...<br>
    and then nothing.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (insistent)<br>
    Again.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    Beverly.</p>
  <p> Still nothing on the monitor. There is a very long,<br>
    quiet beat. Beverly finally takes off her gloves.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    All right...<br>
    (to Ogawa)<br>
    Make a note in the log.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Death occurred at... twelve<br>
    hundred, forty hours.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/11/91 - ACT FIVE 55B.</p>
  <p>55B CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> They all wait for a moment... then Ogawa begins moving<br>
    equipment away from Worf and shutting off the monitors.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    It was all going so well... no<br>
    anomalies during replication...<br>
    no initial rejection...</p>
  <p> Beverly looks up at Russell with bitterness and pain in<br>
    her eyes. She EXITS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/10/91 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>55C INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Troi and Alexander are still on the couch as Beverly<br>
    ENTERS, exchanges a look with Troi.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> Alexander wakes up at the sound... looks at Beverly...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Alexander... I'm so sorry...</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I want to see him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Alex...</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    No. I want to see him!</p>
  <p> And as Beverly and Troi exchange a glance...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>56 OMITTED</p>
  <p>56A INT. MEDICAL LAB</p>
  <p> Beverly, Ogawa, Russell, and Troi watch as Alexander<br>
    bravely walks over to his father's body, which is still<br>
    lying on the surgical table. Russell watches,<br>
    helplessly, in a room where only moments ago she was<br>
    confident and clearly in charge. Alexander is trying<br>
    to hold back his tears... to behave like his father<br>
    would have wanted... he puts his hands on Worf's<br>
    head... manfully throws back his head and tries to<br>
    yell a Klingon howl at the ceiling... but his voice<br>
    breaks and the shout of defiance breaks into a sob and<br>
    the tears finally begin to roll down his face.</p>
  <p> Troi quickly moves to him and takes the boy into her<br>
    arms to comfort him. Beverly, emotionally exhausted,<br>
    looks on for a moment... her eyes turn to Worf.</p>
  <p>56B BEVERLY'S POV</p>
  <p> Worf's still form on the table... suddenly his neck<br>
    stiffens, chin snaps back slightly and he takes in a<br>
    quick, shallow breath... holds it for a beat... then<br>
    releases it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/11/91 - ACT FIVE 56A.</p>
  <p>56C BEVERLY</p>
  <p> takes a moment to realize what's happening, then she<br>
    reacts and races over to Worf.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Ogawa)<br>
    Activate biomonitors. Twenty-five<br>
    cc's polyadrenaline.</p>
  <p> Ogawa turns on a few of the monitors in the b.g. and<br>
    hands Beverly a hypospray. Troi and Alexander look up<br>
    with curiosity. Beverly moves to the monitors and<br>
    begins to scan them quickly... they all still show<br>
    nothing.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    What's going on?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (still looking at<br>
    monitors)<br>
    I'm not sure...<br>
    (beat, realizing)<br>
    But, if I'm right, one of those<br>
    &quot;unnecessary redundancies&quot; might<br>
    be---</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Doctor!</p>
  <p> They all look at Ogawa's monitor, which is beginning to<br>
    show an irregular HEART BEAT.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's it! Begin cardio-aid and<br>
    ventilation.</p>
  <p> More and more monitors begin to come to life and show a<br>
    living body once again.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (amazed)<br>
    Look at that... he must have<br>
    a backup for his synaptic<br>
    functions as well.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Vital signs are stabilizing...</p>
  <p> Alexander hugs Troi with joy as relief sweeps the room.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>57 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship in orbit around the planet seen in the Teaser.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - REV. 12/12/91 - ACT FIVE 56B.</p>
  <p>58 INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Beverly is at her desk as Russell ENTERS from sickbay.<br>
    Russell's attitude is light and pleasant.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    Well, I'd say your patient's<br>
    recovery is going well. I've<br>
    never seen anyone up on their feet<br>
    so soon after this kind of<br>
    surgery.</p>
  <p> Beverly doesn't answer, but turns to look at a PADD<br>
    sitting on her desk. Russell's light manner falls away<br>
    as she realizes that Beverly isn't going to let bygones<br>
    be bygones.</p>
  <p> RUSSELL<br>
    You're not even going to<br>
    acknowledge what I did for him<br>
    are you? You just can't admit<br>
    that it was my research which made<br>
    this possible.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks up and considers Russell for a moment.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm delighted that Worf is going<br>
    to recover. You gambled. He won.<br>
    Most of your patients aren't so<br>
    lucky.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You scare me, Doctor. You risk<br>
    peoples' lives and justify it in<br>
    the name of research. But genuine<br>
    research takes time... sometimes<br>
    a lifetime of painstaking,<br>
    detailed work to get results.<br>
    Not you -- you take shortcuts...<br>
    right through living tissue. You<br>
    put your &quot;research&quot; ahead of your<br>
    patients, and as far as I'm<br>
    concerned, that's a violation of<br>
    our most sacred trust.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    No one remembers the patients who<br>
    died unnecessarily... not in the<br>
    glow of a remarkable achievement<br>
    like this one, do they? I'm sure<br>
    the work you've done here will be<br>
    hailed as a stunning breakthrough.<br>
    Enjoy your laurels, Doctor. I'm not<br>
    sure I could.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - 12/09/91 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>58 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Beverly turns away from Russell and picks up the PADD<br>
    again. Russell watches her for a moment... then EXITS.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>59 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship leaves orbit and goes into warp.</p>
  <p>60 INT. WORF'S SICKBAY ROOM</p>
  <p> Worf is standing between two parallel bars which are<br>
    at waist level. Some of his weight is on his arms,<br>
    which are tightly gripping the bars, but he is making<br>
    good progress as he tries to walk. Troi, Beverly,<br>
    and Alexander stand off to one side and watch.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I told you this would take time,<br>
    Worf.</p>
  <p> Worf struggles to lurch forward another step.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Your muscles are still sorting<br>
    out the new neural inputs...<br>
    don't rush it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ethics&quot; - 12/09/91 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>60 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf moves forward another step and his leg falters...<br>
    he almost falls, but catches himself on the bars.<br>
    Alexander almost rushes over, but Troi gently puts a<br>
    hand on his shoulder.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (softly)<br>
    Alexander, remember what we talked<br>
    about. Your father wants to do<br>
    this by himself.</p>
  <p> Alexander nods reluctantly and waits with Troi.</p>
  <p>61 WORF</p>
  <p> Steadies himself again... he looks at Alexander for<br>
    a moment... sees the look of concern and helplessness<br>
    on the boy's face. Worf thinks for a few seconds and<br>
    then turns to Troi.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It's all right, Counselor. I<br>
    would... appreciate some help<br>
    from my son.</p>
  <p> Alexander's face lights up and he runs over to his<br>
    father and helps him to straighten out his leg.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Alexander)<br>
    We will... work together.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> They share a moment together and now with his son at<br>
    his side, Worf resolutely begins to put one foot<br>
    forward again.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
