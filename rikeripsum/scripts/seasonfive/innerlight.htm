  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45944.1.<br>
    We're en route to Starbase<br>
    Two-eighteen after a magnetic wave<br>
    survey of the Parvenium Sector.<br>
    We will give our report directly<br>
    to Fleet Admiral Gustafson.</p>
  <p>4 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF, and GEORDI at their<br>
    positions; N.D.'s as necessary. There is a<br>
    light-hearted mood on the bridge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The last time I encountered<br>
    Admiral Gustafson... I ended up<br>
    spending nine straight hours at<br>
    the opera.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Nine hours... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The entire &quot;Ring&quot; cycle at one<br>
    sitting...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's a little too much Wagner<br>
    for me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And for me... but not, apparently,<br>
    for Admiral Gustafson. She went<br>
    back the next day and sat through<br>
    it all again. I warned her that<br>
    this time --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Inner Light&quot; - 3/24/92 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, sensors detect an<br>
    unidentified object... twenty-two<br>
    thousand kilometers off the port<br>
    quarter.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p>5 ANGLE - VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> An alien object of unusual shape can be seen, though<br>
    still at quite a distance. Picard moves toward the<br>
    screen, between t conn and ops.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Magnify.</p>
  <p> The object springs into greater relief. It is strange,<br>
    and somehow foreboding.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It appears to be a probe of some<br>
    kind... but there is no Starfleet<br>
    record of this shape or design.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is it scanning us?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No sir... but it has assumed a<br>
    relative position and is holding<br>
    course with us.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The probe is composed of...<br>
    paricium and talgonite... a<br>
    ceramic alloy.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not a very sophisticated<br>
    technology...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, I'm detecting a low-level<br>
    nucleonic beam coming from the<br>
    probe.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Inner Light&quot; - REV. 3/26/92 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Shields up; stand by phasers.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The beam is scanning the shield's<br>
    perimeter.<br>
    (frowns)<br>
    The probe is emitting an unusual<br>
    particle stream --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, the beam is penetrating<br>
    our shields --</p>
  <p> A point at the top of the probe seems to FLARE briefly,<br>
    as...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Increase power to --</p>
  <p> Suddenly Picard staggers backward, as though struck.<br>
    He sags, losing consciousness. Riker is already<br>
    rushing to him as he begins falling.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain?...</p>
  <p>6 CLOSER - PICARD</p>
  <p> As he falls, losing consciousness, Riker's hand ENTERS<br>
    FRAME behind Picard's head so as to protect it, cushion<br>
    it, against the hard deck toward which it's<br>
    falling...</p>
  <p>7 PICARD'S POV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker's face leaning in close...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, I've got you; it's<br>
    all...</p>
  <p> Riker and his surroundings DISSOLVE in a DAZZLE OF<br>
    COLORS. A beat later the COLORS RE-DISSOLVE INTO...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Inner Light&quot; - REV. 3/26/92 - TEASER 3A.</p>
  <p>8 PICARD'S NEW POV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> ELINE, a fine looking mid-thirtyish woman -- whose<br>
    face becomes a thing of radiance when she smiles --<br>
    leans over him, blotting his forehead with a moist<br>
    towel.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    Well.. finally.</p>
  <p> We'll now see that Picard and Eline are:</p>
  <p>9 INT. KAMIN MAIN ROOM - DAY</p>
  <p> He realizes he's seated in a deep and comfortable chair<br>
    in the modest, certainly unusual (to us), but well-kept<br>
    and inviting main room of what is apparently a home.<br>
    In addition to the front entry, there are openings to<br>
    the (o.s.) kitchen and (o.s.) bedroom. Picard just<br>
    peers around; confused.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    (continuing, gently)<br>
    How are you feeling?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Inner Light&quot; - 3/24/92 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> As she lightly strokes his face with the moist towel:</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    (gently)<br>
    Kamin... can you answer me?</p>
  <p> Picard rises to a sitting position, still scanning the<br>
    room, a little groggy and disoriented.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where is this... ?</p>
  <p> A frown of concern on the woman's face.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    You're still feverish...</p>
  <p> Picard looks around, getting control of his faculties.<br>
    Everything he sees is strange, unaccustomed. Might<br>
    he be in a holodeck program?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Computer, freeze program.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    End program.</p>
  <p> Nothing. The woman keeps moving, trying to blot his<br>
    forehead. He gets to his feet, automatically reaching<br>
    for his communicator.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard to Enterprise --</p>
  <p> But there is nothing there to hit. He looks down at<br>
    his garb -- strange and alien.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    Kamin, please don't try to get<br>
    up yet... you're still not well.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I asked you... what is this place?</p>
  <p> Her look is of loving concern.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    This... is your home, of course.</p>
  <p> MOVE IN ON PICARD'S FACE, and HOLD, until we...</p>

  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>10 INT. KAMIN MAIN ROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)</p>
  <p> Picard and Eline just as they were. He's up and<br>
    moving, inspecting the room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where is my uniform? My<br>
    communicator?</p>
  <p> She looks truly worried.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    I'd better call the doctor<br>
    again...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of<br>
    the Federation Starship<br>
    Enterprise. I would like to speak<br>
    with whoever is in charge here.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    (frightened now)<br>
    If you'll just lie down, I'll brew<br>
    you some nice warm kenomay...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Just tell me this -- am I a<br>
    prisoner here?</p>
  <p> Her eyes widen in alarm.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    Please, dear... you've had a high<br>
    fever for three days... you<br>
    mustn't push yourself too<br>
    quickly...</p>
  <p> Picard has discovered a panel in the wall which<br>
    contains a small metallic square in the center. He<br>
    touches it, it opens.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    You shouldn't go outside...</p>
  <p> Picard moves to EXIT... a bit cautiously...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Inner Light&quot; - 3/24/92 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>11 OMITTED</p>
  <p>12 EXT. COURTYARD FRONTING KAMIN HOME - DAY (CONTINUOUS)</p>
  <p> The dwelling is smooth and pale, with the appearance<br>
    of a Mediterranean villa. There is a modest front<br>
    courtyard with a garden -- now blooming with odd and<br>
    alien flora. Picard steps out into the courtyard,<br>
    shading his eyes against the bright sunlight; stops<br>
    as the door closes behind him to survey the area.<br>
    Eline follows him, concerned.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    Kamin... please come back<br>
    inside...</p>
  <p> She follows him briefly as he makes his way out of the<br>
    courtyard, then stops in frustration, realizing he will<br>
    not listen.</p>
  <p>13 EXT. TOWN SQUARE - HIS POV</p>
  <p> More of the white stucco-like dwellings, a square area<br>
    in the center where SEVERAL TOWNFOLK have gathered.<br>
    A fine-looking, pretty-faced youngish woman crosses<br>
    Picard's path en route to the gathered group. She<br>
    smiles in recognition, and waves at him as she goes.</p>
  <p>14 ANGLE ON GROUP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Picard approaches. There is a small group of people<br>
    gathered around a man -- BATAI, a genial-looking man<br>
    in his 50's -- who is just finishing the planting of<br>
    a sapling tree, tamping down the earth and then rising<br>
    to address the group.</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    This sapling is planted as an<br>
    affirmation of life... in defiance<br>
    of the drought and with<br>
    expectations of long life.<br>
    Whatever comes -- we will keep<br>
    it alive, as a symbol of our<br>
    survival.</p>
  <p> The group applauds... and then Batai spots Picard.</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    (happy relief)<br>
    Kamin! You're back on your feet!<br>
    How do you feel, my friend?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Inner Light&quot; - 3/24/92 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you in charge here?</p>
  <p> Batai is a bit taken aback by the brusque question.</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    In charge... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I want to be returned to my ship<br>
    immediately.</p>
  <p> The group has a reaction to this... exchanging curious<br>
    glances. Batai moves closer to Picard.</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    What... ship is that?</p>
  <p> The honest confusion in the man frustrates Picard.<br>
    He looks around, takes a breath... tries again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Please... if you could tell me...<br>
    what is this place? Where am I?</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    (getting it)<br>
    The fever... it's taken your<br>
    memory.</p>
  <p> Picard stares at him... mind working quickly...<br>
    frustrated by his inability to get straight answers<br>
    from these people. He decides on a different tack.<br>
    He smiles a bit ruefully.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That must be it. Perhaps you<br>
    could help me...</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    Anything, my friend.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My name is Kamin... and you are<br>
    -- ?</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    (wary, this is strange)<br>
    Batai...<br>
    (helpful)<br>
    Council leader.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Inner Light&quot; - 3/24/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah. And you say I've been ill...</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    For over a week. Eline should've<br>
    put you in the hospital, but she<br>
    insisted on caring for you<br>
    herself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Eline.</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    Your wife. If you don't remember<br>
    that, maybe it's safer not to go<br>
    home.</p>
  <p> Picard allows himself a genial smile. He is at least<br>
    getting information.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And... what is this place?</p>
  <p> Batai becomes wary again, alarmed by his friend's total<br>
    memory loss.</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    Perhaps you should see the<br>
    doctor...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Please -- I'm sure it will come<br>
    back to me...</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    (gesturing)<br>
    This... is the community of<br>
    Ressik. Northern province.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What planet?</p>
  <p> Batai appears mystified, then comes toward Picard, puts<br>
    an arm around his shoulder.</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    Come... let me take you back home.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm really quite all right. If<br>
    you'll just answer...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Inner Light&quot; - REV. 3/26/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    (carefully)<br>
    This is the planet Kataan.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Kataan... not a Federation<br>
    planet.</p>
  <p> Batai looks at him, puzzled. Picard gives the group<br>
    a reassuring smile.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think I'll take a walk...</p>
  <p> A hesitation.</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    You've been ill for a week...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Exercise will do me good. I'd<br>
    like to -- re-acquaint myself with<br>
    the surroundings.</p>
  <p> He gives a nod, then begins to stride purposefully out<br>
    of the square. Batai stares after him, as do the<br>
    mystified townspeople.</p>

  <p>16A EXT. FIELDS - DAY</p>
  <p> Picard roams the hills beyond the town, searching for<br>
    clues to his mysterious abduction. He climbs a small<br>
    ridge, stares off in the distance, then climbs down and<br>
    proceeds on his way.</p>
  <p>17 OMITTED</p>
  <p>18 INT. KAMIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Eline sits at a small table, idly stirring soup in a<br>
    bowl, when she hears something outside. She jumps up,<br>
    goes to the door, activates it. Picard is standing<br>
    there, bone-weary.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    Thank goodness...</p>
  <p> She ushers him in and he settles in the chair...<br>
    grateful to be off his feet.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Inner Light&quot; - REV. 3/26/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    I've had people out trying to find<br>
    you everywhere. Why did you<br>
    worry us like that?</p>
  <p> He is silent. She tries again.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    Are you hungry?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hungry, thirsty... weary... I<br>
    suppose that proves this isn't<br>
    a dream, doesn't it?</p>
  <p> She stands, stunned, staring at him.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    You think this... your life...<br>
    is a dream?</p>
  <p> The note of anguish in her voice catches him. His<br>
    reply is gentle.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's not my life... I know that<br>
    much.</p>
  <p> Stricken, she blinks away tears, turns to get food.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    I've kept something hot for you.</p>
  <p> He sits at the table and she carries a bowl of soup to<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    Where did you go?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I walked. For hours.</p>
  <p> He begins eating the soup.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    And you just out of bed...</p>
  <p> She sits opposite him, grateful to have him back,<br>
    devotion in her eyes. Picard busies himself with the<br>
    soup.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is delicious...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Inner Light&quot; - REV. 3/26/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    (pleased)<br>
    You always say that...</p>
  <p> He looks up at her, reminded of his apparent history<br>
    with this woman. He decides to approach her head-on.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Would you -- answer some questions<br>
    for me? No matter how strange<br>
    they might seem to you?</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    Of course...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are there other planets in this<br>
    star system? Do you visit any<br>
    other systems... ?</p>
  <p> Shocked, she literally just gapes at him. He reads her<br>
    response.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right. Is there any kind of<br>
    communication system here? How<br>
    do you send messages to... to<br>
    other communities? Other places?</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    The usual way... by<br>
    voice-transit conductors. Do<br>
    you want to send a message?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. When can that be arranged?</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    Tomorrow.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Don't you want to ask about...<br>
    us?</p>
  <p> Picard hears the note of anguish in her voice. He sets<br>
    down his spoon, softens.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course. Anything you can tell<br>
    me would be helpful. We are...<br>
    married?</p>
  <p> She nods, clearly in pain that he has no recollection<br>
    of this.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    Three years ago... the happiest<br>
    day of my life was the day we got<br>
    married.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You're probably tired of hearing<br>
    it... but I've loved you since<br>
    I was seven years old. That's<br>
    when I decided I was going to be<br>
    your wife, and no one was going<br>
    to change my mind.</p>
  <p> She smiles at him, reaches out and covers his hand with<br>
    hers.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    I'm glad I was so stubborn...</p>
  <p> He stares at her. Her warmth, her sincerity are<br>
    obvious. It puts him in an uncomfortable position. He<br>
    tries to return to his agenda.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it that I do... here in<br>
    Ressik?</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    (great pride)<br>
    You're the best iron weaver in<br>
    the community. At least I think<br>
    so. You prefer playing the flute,<br>
    of course.</p>

  <p>18 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The flute?</p>
  <p> She rises, goes to a nearby shelf (or whatever) and<br>
    brings to him. It is a device much like a<br>
    penny-whistle. He holds it, turning it over in his<br>
    hands; it is completely unfamiliar.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And when did I learn to play it?</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    (laughing again)<br>
    I'm afraid you've never learned,<br>
    dear. You do keep trying.</p>
  <p> Picard puts the device to him mouth... tries a few<br>
    notes... it sounds pretty awful. Even Picard can't<br>
    help but smile.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see what you mean.</p>
  <p> He sets the flute down, rises.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you for the soup. And for<br>
    your help. Tomorrow will you help<br>
    me send a message?</p>
  <p> She smiles as though indulging a child. She has him<br>
    back... he isn't saying strange things anymore. It's<br>
    enough for now.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    Of course. Will you come to bed<br>
    now?</p>
  <p> He stares at her. This is a bit awkward. He looks off<br>
    toward a door which must lead to a bedroom, then back<br>
    at the reclining chair.</p>

    Oh, no... please come with me...</p>
  <p> In her voice, genuine concern. Picard tries diplomacy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've been sick... I may be tossing<br>
    and turning... it wouldn't be fair<br>
    to you.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    (a smile)<br>
    Let me be the judge of that.</p>
  <p> She moves toward him... stretches her arms to hold<br>
    him... and as she does, her dress falls open at the<br>
    neck. Picard stares at what he sees.</p>

  <p> Picard's inert form remains where it was on the deck,<br>
    with Riker kneeling in close attendance. Geordi stands<br>
    just behind him; Data, Worf and the Conn Officer still<br>
    at stations -- as BEVERLY, with emergency medical<br>
    equipment, rushes in from the forward turbolift to<br>
    begin preliminary on-spot diagnosis.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The nucleonic beam is no longer<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Data, find out how that<br>

    Yes, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Geordi, start scanning the probe<br>

    There's no evidence of injury or<br>

  <p> Riker looks in frustration toward the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That probe is doing something to<br>
    him... Data, any progress?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, sir. The particle emission<br>
    is most unusual. I am unable to<br>
    block it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Destroy the probe. Phasers are<br>
    armed and ready.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    I don't think that's wise. Not<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Agreed. Stand down phasers,<br>

  <p> Worf reluctantly obeys.</p>

  <p>27 EXT. KAMIN HOME COURTYARD - DAY</p>
  <p> Picard stands in the courtyard, holding a sextant and<br>
    shooting the sun. He takes a measurement... then<br>
    records his findings in a journal that's lying on a<br>
    bench. Then he holds the instrument up to his eye<br>
    again, continuing.</p>
  <p>28 ANGLE ON ELINE</p>
  <p> who comes from the house and approaches Picard, who is<br>
    absorbed in his work. She watches him silently for a<br>
    moment, aware of his intense preoccupation. She moves<br>
    toward him.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    You've been dreaming of that<br>
    starship again, haven't you?</p>
  <p>29 PICARD AND ELINE</p>
  <p> He lowers the instrument, turns toward her. This is an<br>
    old conversation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm just charting the sun's<br>
    movements. It might give some<br>
    clues to the cause of this<br>
    drought.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    I think you're still trying to<br>
    figure out where you are... where<br>
    that ship of yours is... what you<br>
    can do to get back to that life...</p>
  <p> Picard sets the sextant down.</p>

    The memory's five years old now,<br>
    but it's still inside me.<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    My other existence may be gone,<br>
    but I still wonder about it.</p>
  <p> She regards him solemnly, then begins idly circling the<br>
    courtyard... breaking off a dead flower or branch now<br>
    and then. The garden has deteriorated; what were once<br>
    abundant blooms are now small sickly plants without<br>
    blossoms.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    Was it so much better than this<br>
    one?</p>
  <p> He gives her a sharp look. Undaunted, she proceeds.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    So much more gratifying... so much<br>
    more fulfilling... that you cling<br>
    to it with such stubbornness?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Eline...</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    It must have been extraordinary...<br>
    but never once, in all the stories<br>
    you've told me... have you<br>
    mentioned anyone who loved you<br>
    as I do.</p>
  <p> He is pained. She is right...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It was real... as real as this<br>
    is. You can't expect me to forget<br>
    the lifetime I spent there...</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    Yes, I can.</p>
  <p> He looks at her. There is a new sound in her voice, a<br>
    tilt to her chin.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    I've been patient, Kamin. For<br>
    five years I have shared you with<br>
    that other life.<br>

    But I have been lonely. Knowing<br>
    that your heart is really...<br>

    No, thank you...<br>

    to Batai, frowning. Batai smiles with understanding.</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    She always was strong-minded.<br>
    Even when she was a child.</p>
  <p> They start walking toward the town square.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It isn't her fault. These last<br>
    few years have been difficult for<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> Batai gives him a glance.</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    And for you, I think.</p>

  <p>30 EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY (CONTINUOUS)</p>
  <p> A group of the townspeople are gathered near the tree.<br>
    The ADMINISTRATOR, a youngish man in an outfit which<br>
    distinguishes him from the others, stands inspecting<br>
    the tree. As Picard and Batai approach, he turns to<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    There you are, Batai. Perhaps<br>
    you can explain to me... when<br>
    crops are dying all over, how this<br>
    tree is flourishing?</p>
  <p> Batai smiles his genial smile.</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    This tree is our symbol... our<br>
    affirmation of life. Everyone<br>
    in this town gives a part of their<br>
    water rations to keep it alive.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We have learned, Administrator,<br>
    that hope is a powerful weapon<br>
    against anything... even drought.</p>
  <p> The Administrator eyes him, assessing. The young man<br>
    is a politician, and has learned not to interfere too<br>
    drastically in local government. He nods, accepting.</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    A good point. Perhaps I will<br>
    recommend a symbolic tree in each<br>
    of my communities...<br>
    (smiling broadly)<br>
    Now. What business do we have<br>
    today?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Inner Light&quot; - REV. 4/02/92 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    We need help if we're to increase<br>
    the water supply. We think there<br>
    are ways to reclaim some of our<br>
    water...</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    Batai, you're being a bit of an<br>
    alarmist. True, we're in a<br>
    drought... but water rationing<br>
    has produced a sizeable savings.</p>
  <p> Picard can no longer keep quiet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If the weather pattern doesn't<br>
    change, rationing won't be enough.<br>
    We will run out of water.</p>
  <p> The Administrator looks at Picard in some surprise.</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    Who's this?</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    Kamin, sir.</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    Kamin... do I know you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. I haven't spoken to you<br>
    before.</p>
  <p> The Administrator smiles, acknowledging a new<br>
    constituent.</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    Well, Kamin -- I'm open to all<br>
    the people of this town. I'm<br>
    delighted to hear what you have<br>
    to say. Did you have a specific<br>
    proposal?</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I suggest we build atmospheric<br>
    condensers which could extract<br>
    water from the air.</p>
  <p> The Administrator chuckles a little... condescending.<br>
    He's very charming... but gives nothing.</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    Well. Very ambitious. Kamin,<br>
    was it? And your occupation is<br>
    -- ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Iron weaving.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And playing the flute.</p>
  <p> The Administrator looks sharply at him... not sure if<br>
    he's being tweaked -- which he is. But Picard is<br>
    straight-faced.</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    I don't mean to quash your very<br>
    creative idea... but building<br>
    atmospheric condensers would be<br>
    a monumental undertaking. We<br>
    could not hope to sustain such<br>
    a project.</p>

  <p>30 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Each community would be<br>
    responsible for its own. These<br>
    condensers could mean the<br>
    difference between watering our<br>
    crops... or watching them die.</p>
  <p> The Administrator is too experienced to get into a<br>
    wrangle. He smiles and agrees -- an effective<br>
    stonewalling.</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    Well -- I'll be glad to pass<br>
    along your suggestion. You'll<br>
    see that this kind of<br>
    participatory government works<br>
    for everyone.</p>
  <p> He starts away from the group, genial as ever.</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    Be well, Batai. I shall see you<br>
    next month.<br>
    (to Picard, coolly)<br>
    Good to meet you, Kanin.</p>
  <p> The mispronunciation is not intentional, just careless.<br>
    The Administrator turns and begins striding away.</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    Go carefully, Administrator...</p>
  <p> Batai turns back to Picard, who stands staring after<br>
    the Administrator.</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    That went very well. I think he<br>
    was impressed with you.</p>
  <p> Picard can't help but chuckle at this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll never see an atmospheric<br>
    condenser...</p>

    These things take time. It will<br>
    happen, I'm sure of it.</p>
  <p> Picard changes the mood, claps him on the shoulder.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come to dinner tonight, my friend.<br>
    I'll make a vegetable stew. We'll<br>
    talk about building our own<br>
    condenser.</p>
  <p> Batai nods, acquiescing. As Picard starts to turn away<br>
    --</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    Kamin --</p>
  <p> Picard turns back.</p>
  <p> BATAI<br>
    Hearing you talk to the<br>
    Administrator... I realized that<br>
    for the first time in years, you<br>
    were speaking as though you were<br>
    truly a member of the community.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It was good to hear that again.</p>

  <p> Batai, beverage in hand, is sprawled on one of the<br>

    Not very well, and not any melody that we can<br>
    recognize. But he's playing nonetheless, and it's a<br>
    marked improvement from last time. He hits a couple of<br>
    sour notes, and stops, working his fingers over the<br>

    data in his journal. Eline emerges from the house.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    I put your shoes away for you<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah. Thank you, dear.</p>
  <p> She moves toward him, and as he turns away to enter<br>
    notes, she peers through the telescope.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    I've been looking through this<br>
    thing off and on for almost thirty<br>
    years... and I still can't see<br>
    what you and Meribor find so<br>
    fascinating.</p>
  <p> He moves back toward her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Fine. Then maybe you'll sit down<br>
    and rest the way you're supposed<br>
    to.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    (relinquishing the<br>
    telescope)<br>
    You treat me like some frail<br>

  <p> At this moment, the sound of a flute being played in<br>
    the house draws Picard's look. He shakes his head a<br>
    little, moves again to his telescope. Eline sees the<br>
    reaction.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    He loves playing. And he's very<br>
    good at it, you know.</p>
  <p> There is a hint of frustration in Picard's voice as he<br>
    discusses his son.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He loves doing a lot of things<br>
    -- too many. One week he wants<br>
    to be a botanist, the next week<br>
    a sculptor. I wish he could find<br>
    some focus in his life.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    I think he has.</p>
  <p> He looks at her, surprised and curious.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    Maybe you should talk to him.</p>
  <p> Picard realizes something is going on.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (calling)<br>
    Batai?</p>
  <p> The MUSIC abruptly stops, and YOUNG BATAI, twenty,<br>
    emerges from the house, carrying a flute.</p>
  <p> YOUNG BATAI<br>
    Father... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I get the feeling from your mother<br>
    that you have something to tell<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> Mother and son exchange quick glances.</p>

    Yes. I was waiting for the right<br>

    I'm leaving school.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Leaving school -- ? No, you're<br>
    not --</p>
  <p> YOUNG BATAI<br>
    I want to concentrate on my music.<br>
    It's what I care about.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Last year, all you cared about<br>
    was mathematics. A year before<br>
    that it was botany. Now --</p>
  <p> YOUNG BATAI<br>
    But through it all there was my<br>
    music. I think you know that,<br>

    This is the life I want.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at him... realizing that children will<br>
    go their own way, regardless.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll... we'll discuss it.</p>
  <p> Young Batai smiles, suspecting acquiescence.</p>
  <p> YOUNG BATAI<br>
    Thank you, father.</p>
  <p> And he bounds back into the house. Picard picks up<br>
    his journal, leafs through it pensively.</p>
  <p> ELINE<br>
    Even after all these years... you<br>
    have the ability to surprise me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If music is what he wants... why<br>
    should I stand in his way?<br>

    Kamin, what do you hope to<br>

  <p> During the next, their voices rise slightly, each<br>
    topping the other.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> The Administrator suddenly realizes that they are<br>
    speaking loudly, and have drawn a few curious looks.<br>
    He lifts a warning hand to Picard, glances around,<br>
    then, casually, begins to walk. Picard falls in line<br>
    with him.</p>
  <p> ADMINISTRATOR<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    Your observations... your<br>
    findings... our scientists reached<br>
    those same conclusions two years<br>

    Surely the technology exists to<br>
    save something of this world...<br>
    perhaps some people could be<br>
    evacuated...</p>

    is playing keep-away with Picard's old flute. Picard<br>
    &quot;hides&quot; behind the chair; &quot;scares&quot; Kamie, who squeals<br>
    with delight as Picard catches him by the ankle, and<br>

    Some children are certainly making<br>

    Are we, indeed. I'm not going<br>

  <p> Meribor makes the mistake of moving to help her father<br>
    off his knees. Picard, crustily independent, wrenches<br>
    his arm away from her hand, and will make it (a bit<br>
    creakily) to his feet on his own -- as Meribor smiles her<br>
    affectionate understanding. Young Batai takes his<br>
    nephew's hand, and will lead him out after grabbing a<br>

  <p> MERIBOR<br>
    He's my child, and I tell you he<br>

    Come.</p>
  <p> The doors open and Riker ENTERS, carrying a metal box.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hello, sir. Feeling better?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, thank you... but I find I'm<br>
    having to remind myself that this<br>
    --<br>
    (gesturing)<br>
    -- is really my home.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We were able to open the probe<br>
    and examine it. Whatever it was<br>
    that locked onto you must have<br>
    been self-terminating. It isn't<br>
    functional any longer.</p>
  <p> He holds out the box to Picard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We found this inside.</p>
  <p> He hands the box to Picard, who takes it and opens it.</p>
  <p>91A INSERT - THE BOX</p>
  <p> Inside, rests Picard's old flute.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Inner Light&quot; - REV. 3/26/92 - ACT FIVE 57B.</p>
  <p>91B BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> as he lifts it from the box; nods his thanks to<br>
    Riker, who, understanding that this is not a moment<br>
    for words, acknowledges silently -- and EXITS.</p>
  <p> Picard carries the flute to a chair, and, facing away<br>
    from CAMERA, begins playing the now familiar lullaby.<br>
    The flute music continues into:</p>
  <p>92 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> For a long beat, while the ship travels at impulse and<br>
    end credits appear, we continue to hear the same, sweet<br>
    lullaby.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
