  <p>1 OMITTED</p>
  <p>2 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD, RIKER, DATA, and WORF; N.D.s as needed. The<br>
    atmosphere on the bridge is tense -- they're in the<br>
    middle of a pursuit and racing against a clock. Red<br>
    alert is already on.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Forward tubes armed and ready,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Fire.</p>
  <p>2A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Photon torpedoes burst from the forward tubes.</p>
  <p>2B EXT. SPACE - ASTEROID (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The torpedoes speed toward a huge asteroid which is<br>
    streaking toward a nearby planet, and EXPLODE against<br>
    it.</p>
  <p>3 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A direct hit, sir.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The asteroid has shattered.<br>
    However, the core is still intact<br>
    -- and still on a direct collision<br>
    course with Tessen Three.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is it big enough to be a threat?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - REV. 2/03/92 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. It is of sufficient<br>
    size and density to cause<br>
    planetwide damage.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Time to impact.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It will reach the upper<br>
    atmosphere in forty-four seconds<br>
    and impact with the planet eleven<br>
    seconds later.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ready torpedoes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, the core is composed of<br>
    densely compressed nitrium and<br>
    chrondite. It is unlikely that<br>
    another photon torpedo will have<br>
    any effect on it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, prepare the tractor<br>
    beam.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, Captain.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Time to impact is thirty seconds.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, I cannot get a positive lock<br>
    with the tractor beam. There is<br>
    magnetic field interference<br>
    emanating from the core materials.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Suggestions?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If we project a particle beam<br>
    through the deflector dish, we<br>
    may be able to produce a<br>
    disruptive nuclear effect in the<br>
    core.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so.</p>

  <p>6A EXT. SPACE - THE ASTEROID CORE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A beam has emitted from the Enterprise into the<br>
    asteroid core. It buzzes and hums for a second -- and<br>
    then the core bursts apart.</p>
  <p>6B INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The target has been destroyed,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The largest piece of remaining<br>
    debris offers no threat to the<br>
    planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well done. Ensign, put us back<br>
    on course for the Moselina system.<br>
    Warp four as soon as we've cleared<br>
    the debris field.</p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE &amp; TWINKLING STUFF (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As the Enterprise flies through the debris, we see a<br>
    host of small, Twinkling Bits of the shattered asteroid<br>
    make contact with, and adhere to, the ship itself.<br>
    Beat, then -- with Twinkling Stuff attached to its hull<br>
    -- the Enterprise goes into warp drive, and away.</p>

  <p>8 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at warp speed.</p>
  <p>9 INT. TROI'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> WORF and his son ALEXANDER sit stiffly -- side by side<br>
    but separated by their anger at each other -- venting<br>
    it all before a patient TROI.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    My instructions were clear!</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    They were not!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Before being allowed to play, he<br>
    was to put his soiled clothing<br>
    in the garment reprocessor.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I was not!</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I sense a touch of hostility here,<br>
    gentlemen.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I specifically told you that!</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    You told it to me yesterday; not<br>
    today!</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If I may suggest...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You know very well that the same<br>
    rules apply today that...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - REV. 2/04/92 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Please!<br>
    (beat; on their silence)<br>
    Why not simply draw up a contract,<br>
    which defines the duties of each<br>
    family member?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    You mean he tells me what he wants<br>
    and I have to do it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, it means you both agree on<br>
    your responsibilities. And when<br>
    you've done the things you've<br>
    agreed to do, then you've earned<br>
    the privilege of doing things you<br>
    want to do.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    When he's cleaned his room, for<br>
    instance, then maybe he's earned<br>
    a visit to the holodeck to fight<br>
    his alien monsters.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You suggest bribery?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I suggest working out an equitable<br>
    system where the rules are spelled<br>
    out as clearly as possible. For<br>
    the child and the parent. You<br>
    must list your responsibilities,<br>
    too.<br>
    (to Alexander)<br>
    What would you like your father<br>
    to promise?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    No yelling.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (loudly)<br>
    I do not yell.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Then you should have no trouble<br>
    with that part.</p>
  <p> She looks from one to the other.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - REV. 2/04/92 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Well. Why don't you both go back<br>
    to your quarters and talk it over?<br>
    Decide on the points each of you<br>
    wants in the contract...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (beat; grumpy)<br>
    Very well.</p>
  <p> Alexander's answer is a noncommital shrug. Troi<br>
    smiles, with:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    One day you'll be glad your father<br>
    cared enough about you to insist<br>
    on rules. It may seem hard to<br>
    imagine right now... but<br>
    eventually, most children come<br>
    to appreciate their parents.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Riker to Counselor Troi. Your<br>
    mother's just come aboard.</p>
  <p> Troi hears this, takes it in... then...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    On the other hand...</p>

  <p> A Supernumerary stands alongside LWAXANA and MISTER<br>
    HOMN. As she absently gestures Mister Homn to get<br>
    a move on with the abundance of luggage he carries,<br>
    she twines RIKER'S arm in hers.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (effervescing; into com)<br>
    And I've got such deliciously<br>
    exciting news, you're going to<br>
    be absolutely thrilled! I'm<br>
    getting married!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - 2/03/92 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>11 OMITTED</p>
  <p>12 INT. TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> Troi and Lwaxana are seated -- Troi initially<br>
    immobilized by her shock.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (peering around)<br>
    You know, with just a bit of<br>
    redecorating here and there, this<br>
    Ten-Forward room should make a<br>
    very nice wedding hall.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I beg your pardon?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    My dear, where else? Among all<br>
    my good friends... in the presence<br>
    of my adored daughter...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother, where did you... when did<br>
    you meet this man? Who is he?<br>
    I mean... marriage. When did all<br>
    this happen?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Ah, my poor plodding little<br>
    Deanna, with her questions<br>
    questions questions. Wherever<br>
    did you inherit such pedestrian<br>
    genes? What matters, my sweet,<br>
    is that your mother's happy.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother, if you're happy, then I'm<br>
    happy for you. I only asked who<br>
    this man is, and where you met<br>
    him. Those are not unusual<br>
    questions.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    He's a wonderful man, my dear;<br>
    he has such good breeding, I tell<br>
    you, he's absolute perfection.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Who is he?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - 2/03/92 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    He is Campio; third minister to<br>
    the Conference Of Judges on the<br>
    planet Kostolain. Royalty, my<br>
    dear; naturally.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Naturally. I didn't know you'd<br>
    ever been to Kostolain. Or was<br>
    he on some diplomatic mission to<br>
    Betazed... ?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Well, neither, actually. I<br>
    haven't exactly met him yet,<br>
    really. Oh, but the profiles<br>
    we've exchanged. They're in such<br>
    accord that you'd absolutely weep,<br>
    my dear; you'd weep at the harmony<br>
    between us.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - 2/03/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother. Don't you think you<br>
    should at least meet the man<br>
    you're going to marry before<br>
    committing to spend the rest of<br>
    your life with him?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Deanna, I love you, but you do<br>
    make everything sound like an<br>
    epitaph.</p>
  <p>13 INCLUDING WORF &amp; ALEXANDER</p>
  <p> as they ENTER. Heading for Troi's table, they're<br>
    locked in animated debate.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I don't want to agree!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You have to agree. That's what<br>
    an agreement is.<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Excuse the intrusion, Counselor,<br>
    but we are having some difficulty<br>
    drawing up our contract.<br>
    (nods to Lwaxana)<br>
    Mrs. Troi.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    He isn't fair!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The boy is unreasonable.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (liking Alex)<br>
    Well of course he's unreasonable;<br>
    he's a child.<br>
    (chucks Alex under chin)<br>
    And such a child. Making little<br>
    boys reasonable only gives them<br>
    pimples.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Alexander, this is my mother.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - 2/03/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Alexander! What a wonderful name.<br>
    I once knew a tall, handsome<br>
    warrior named Alexander who<br>
    utterly adored me. We went<br>
    everywhere; simply everywhere.<br>
    Have you been anywhere yet?<br>
    (abruptly; to Troi)<br>
    Contract? What contract?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's between father and son. A<br>
    fair and balanced way of achieving<br>
    a mutual sense of order.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (to Alex)<br>
    How ghastly for you.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    And you're doing this to your own<br>
    child, Mister Woof?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is Worf, Madam.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Contracts are usually for people<br>
    who don't really trust each other.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    A child who is trusted becomes<br>
    worthy of that trust.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother, will you kindly stay out<br>
    of this?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    If he doesn't perform his<br>
    contractual duties, I assume he<br>
    would be chastised?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He would be... sanctioned, yes.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    But if you fail to perform your<br>
    duties, what's the child supposed<br>
    to do about it?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - 2/03/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother, will you please!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I, not perform my duty?!</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Alexander. Life's true gift is<br>
    the capacity to enjoy enjoyment.<br>
    Now...</p>
  <p> She draws Alexander gently toward her; leans to put<br>
    herself almost nose-to-nose with the boy -- cupping<br>
    his little chin in her hand, as:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (cont'd)<br>
    ... Have I arrived too late, or...<br>
    (grins warmly)<br>
    ... Can you still smile?</p>
  <p> And, still nose-to-nose with the smiling Lwaxana, <br>
    Alexander grins from ear to ear. An unmistakable and <br>
    very personal one-on-one bonding here. Friendship.</p>
  <p>14 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker move along the corridor, during:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Married? She's getting married?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If we hold present course, we'll<br>
    rendezvous with her intended groom<br>
    in thirty-one hours.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will not continue to have this<br>
    ship used by that woman for her<br>
    convenience, simply because her<br>
    daughter is one of my officers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Apparently, Deanna's being aboard<br>
    was only part of the reason.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The other part being?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - 2/03/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    She seems to think that the honor<br>
    of giving away the bride should<br>
    belong to you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (halts, musing; resumes<br>
    walking)<br>
    Permission for an on-board wedding<br>
    is granted, Number One. Nothing<br>
    would please me more than giving<br>
    Mrs. Troi away.</p>
  <p>15 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As Picard and Riker recede into b.g. along the<br>
    corridor, CAMERA discovers -- along a seam of ceiling<br>
    in f.g. -- a moving line of the Twinkling Particles<br>
    seen earlier outside the ship. As it moves, the line<br>
    drips, like drops of sparkling liquid, through the air<br>
    to the flooring, where it forms a sort of glittering<br>
    puddle. Beat -- then it disappears downward through<br>
    the flooring itself.</p>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>16 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> moving along at warp.</p>
  <p>17 INT. TROI'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Alexander sits, alone and disconsolate -- as Lwaxana<br>
    ENTERS.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Ah! My little warrior. And how<br>
    are you this morning?</p>
  <p> Alex, staring sadly at the floor, just shrugs in<br>
    response.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (gently)<br>
    Oh, I see.</p>
  <p> And, having dropped her usual off-handed effervescence,<br>
    she sits quietly down beside him.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Being punished for something, are<br>
    we?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    It's just my regular time with<br>
    Counselor Troi. She's not here<br>
    yet.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    You came early. Well, that's very<br>
    responsible of you.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    No, I just wanted to be out of<br>
    my room before...<br>
    (shrugs)</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Before what?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Now if we're going to be real<br>
    friends, we have to share only<br>
    the truth.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - 2/03/92 - ACT TWO 13.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Well for one thing, it's easier.<br>
    When you tell the truth, you never<br>
    have to remember later what you<br>
    lied about.</p>
  <p> Alex doesn't particularly want to smile -- but he can't<br>
    help it.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (cont'd)<br>
    But mostly, a true friend is a<br>
    person you can always tell the<br>
    truth to without worrying about<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I wanted to leave before my father<br>
    got back.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Ah.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I hate him. I wish my mother was<br>
    here.<br>
    (angrily)<br>
    But she died.</p>
  <p> She gently hugs Alexander to her, without overwhelming<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    And that's not very fair, is it?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    All he cares about are rules.<br>
    I'm supposed to do everything<br>
    right all the time.<br>
    (wilting; blurts:)<br>
    And I don't know how!</p>
  <p> He buries his head against her. She hugs him more<br>
    firmly; more securely.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Tell you the truth, little<br>
    warrior, neither do I.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - 2/03/92 - ACT TWO 14.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (cont'd)<br>
    But I do know one marvelous thing<br>
    you can do with rules.</p>
  <p> Taking his hand in hers, she rises and heads for the<br>
    exit, as:</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    (unsure)<br>
    I'm supposed to wait for Counselor<br>
    Troi.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (mischievous Grin)<br>
    Exactly.</p>
  <p> And they're out of there.</p>
  <p>18 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HOLODECK</p>
  <p> Lwaxana and Alexander are headed for the (o.s.)<br>
    holodeck.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    I'll bet you've never been to the<br>
    colony of free spirits.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    What do they do there?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Whatever they want. Artists,<br>
    philosophers, free-thinkers...</p>
  <p> She leans and tweaks his nose a little, as:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (cont'd)<br>
    ... people who don't quite fit<br>
    other people's rules. Personally,<br>
    I come for the mudbaths. You'll<br>
    adore the mudbaths.<br>
    (at Holodeck door)<br>
    Computer? I'm assuming you have<br>
    the Parallax Colony of Shiralea<br>
    VI?</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    That program is available.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Then run it for us, dear.</p>
  <p> As Lwaxana leads Alexander through the door, we go to:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - REV. 2/12/92 - ACT TWO 15.</p>
  <p>19 EXT. CENTER OF SHIRALEA VI GLADE (HOLODECK)<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as, having entered, Lwaxana and Alexander look off<br>
    (o.s.) to see:</p>
  <p>19A A LARGE FLOATING SPHERE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> which descends toward them. Contained in the sphere is<br>
    a wild, wonderful alien face...</p>
  <p>19B LWAXANA AND ALEXANDER</p>
  <p> react as the sphere bounces in front of them... then<br>
    SHOOTS back up and out of sight.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    What was that?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    A Wind Dancer... he stands guard.<br>
    Only those whose hearts are<br>
    joyous may enter.</p>
  <p> Now their attention is caught by something ahead:</p>
  <p>20 THEIR POV - FIRE ARTIST (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Standing by herself in the clearing, a Fire Artist<br>
    holds a burning firebrand in her hand. She brings it<br>
    up close to her mouth, and, exhaling deeply, uses her<br>
    breath (which catches fire) to create a lovely fire<br>
    design in the air before it finally disappears.</p>
  <p>21 RESUME - LWAXANA &amp; ALEXANDER</p>
  <p> Alexander is wide-eyed at the (o.s.) sight.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Fire sculptor. We'll chat with<br>
    her later if you're not wearing<br>
    anything flammable.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - REV. 2/12/92 - ACT TWO 16.</p>
  <p>22 INCLUDING JUGGLER</p>
  <p> as he ENTERS both FRAME and the conversation.<br>
    Constantly juggling several multicolored, variously<br>
    sized balls.</p>
  <p> JUGGLER<br>
    A few of us were just gathering<br>
    together for our laughing hour.<br>
    Would you care to come laugh with<br>
    us?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Actually, we were about to<br>
    experience a mudbath.</p>
  <p> JUGGLER<br>
    Were you! What an idea! My<br>
    friends and I will join you.<br>
    One can always...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    ... laugh in the bath.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - REV. 2/12/92 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    (re: balls)<br>
    Do you ever drop one?</p>
  <p> JUGGLER<br>
    No, no, no. They are my worlds,<br>
    and I protect them. I am a master<br>
    of worlds, and they fly only as<br>
    I wish.</p>
  <p>23 INCLUDING YOUNG MAN &amp; WOMAN</p>
  <p> Emerging from behind a structure are a YOUNG, extremely<br>
    attractive (humanoid) MAN &amp; WOMAN.</p>
  <p> JUGGLER<br>
    (to Young Couple)<br>
    We're having guests for laughing<br>
    hour. Come join us!</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    We'd love to!</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    No, thank you.</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    (pleasantly)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - REV. 2/05/92 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    (pleasantly)<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    Why do you always say &quot;no&quot; when<br>
    I say &quot;yes&quot;?</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    I don't.</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    You just did.</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    There you go again. You are the<br>
    most negative person!</p>
  <p> They will continue arguing (o.s.), as:</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Why are they arguing like that?</p>
  <p> JUGGLER<br>
    They're friends. They love<br>
    contradiction... they thrive on<br>
    challenge... they flourish in<br>
    conflict...</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Then why are they friends?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Who else can you fight with if<br>
    not your friends?</p>
  <p>24 INCLUDING POET</p>
  <p> A tall, white-bearded old POET, in white toga, suddenly<br>
    appears before them, with hand raised -- like Moses<br>
    -- to block their way.</p>
  <p> POET<br>
    Hold! What is the lesson for<br>
    today!?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - 2/03/92 - ACT TWO 18A.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Damned if we know. We're just<br>
    here for some fun and a mudbath.</p>
  <p> POET<br>
    Every moment requires a purpose.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (nicely)<br>
    No, it doesn't.</p>
  <p> POET<br>
    Every purpose requires a plan.</p>
  <p> JUGGLER<br>
    He does this every day; usually<br>
    while everybody's food gets cold.<br>
    Rather boring.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - 2/03/92 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> POET<br>
    (pronounces)<br>
    The higher... the fewer!</p>
  <p> Nobody knows what the hell that means. They all regard<br>
    each other quizzically. Finally:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Well, that's a<br>
    conversation-stopper if I ever<br>
    heard one.</p>
  <p>25 FAVORING ALEXANDER</p>
  <p> Beat -- then he rushes back to the locale of the<br>
    still-arguing Young Man and Woman, and:</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Excuse me!</p>
  <p> The Young Man and Woman Pause in their verbal duel to<br>
    regard Alex.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    If you're going to argue, you<br>
    should remember...<br>
    (pronounces)<br>
    The higher, the fewer!</p>
  <p> HOLD for a LONG BEAT on the Young Man &amp; Woman -- as<br>
    they just stand there; trying to fathom that. The<br>
    fight's ceased. As Alex runs off again, we</p>
  <p>26 RESUME - GROUP</p>
  <p> Lwaxana is delighted with Alexander; welcomes him with<br>
    a hug.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    So, my little warrior wants to<br>
    see more in life than just<br>
    fighting. Ah, the mind opens,<br>
    and in creeps wisdom.<br>
    (takes Alex's hand)<br>
    Onward, to the laughing!</p>
  <p>27 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Worf is tidying up after Alex, as his door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - 2/03/92 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Troi ENTERS. Worf looks surprised.</p>
  <p> WORF (cont'd)<br>
    Isn't Alexander supposed to be<br>
    with you?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (now concerned)<br>
    He didn't show up for his<br>
    appointment, so I assumed he must<br>
    still be here.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Computer. What is the location<br>
    of Alexander Rozhenko?</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Alexander Rozhenko is in holodeck<br>
    two.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Is he there alone?</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    He is with Lwaxana Troi.</p>
  <p> Troi and Worf exchange looks for a very dubious beat<br>
    -- then, without a word, move quickly to EXIT.</p>
  <p>28 EXT. EDGE OF SHIRALEAN VI GLADE - DAY (HOLODECK)</p>
  <p> At a site fronting one of the tents, Lwaxana, Alex,<br>
    the JUGGLER, the Young Man &amp; Woman -- even the old Poet<br>
    -- sit side by side in a long, trench-like rectangular<br>
    mudbath. Up to their shoulders. The Helper is pouring<br>
    a final (small) tub of mud into the bath. Only the<br>
    two green-smocked Learners remain seated out of the<br>
    mudbath, opposite its occupants; studying and<br>
    listening.</p>
  <p> At the moment, all bathers hold high a form of (edible)<br>
    cup, containing some liquid, in a general toast:</p>
  <p> POET<br>
    To all the creatures within us!</p>
  <p> All drink to that toast -- then begin munching happily<br>
    on the now empty cups.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - REV. 2/04/92 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>29 CLOSER ON LWAXANA &amp; ALEXANDER</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    All the creatures within us?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Of course. Every one of us has<br>
    a thousand different kinds of tiny<br>
    people inside us. Some of them<br>
    want to get out and be wild; some<br>
    want to be sad, or happy, or<br>
    inventive or even go dancing.<br>
    That's why we have different urges<br>
    at different times.</p>
  <p> JUGGLER<br>
    Are we ready for the<br>
    entertainment?!</p>
  <p> ALL IN GROUP<br>
    Ready! Yes! Absolutely!</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (still to Alex)<br>
    And all those different little<br>
    people inside us? We must never<br>
    be afraid to take them with us<br>
    wherever we go. Who knows when<br>
    we might need one of them to pop<br>
    up and rescue us from ourselves.<br>
    Variety, my little Alex. The<br>
    great secret is not the variety<br>
    of life; but the variety of us!</p>
  <p>30 EXT. CENTER OF SHIRALEAN VI GLADE - DAY (HOLODECK)<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Troi and Worf arrive; look around. Suddenly, the<br>
    Wind Dancer descends toward them -- a menacing look<br>
    on his face. The ball dances in front of Worf,<br>
    blocking him from moving forward. Frustrated, Worf<br>
    SWATS him aside -- and the Wind Dancer pops! Worf and<br>
    Troi exchange a surprised look and move forward.<br>
    MUSIC as well (a one instrument tune, the rhythm of<br>
    which is not unlike that which would accompany a 20th-<br>
    century bellydance). Troi and Worf begin Walking<br>
    toward the (o.s.) sounds.</p>
  <p>31 EXT. EDGE OF SHIRALEAN VI GLADE - DAY (HOLODECK)</p>
  <p> A great-looking Tattooed Female Dancer is entertaining<br>
    our group (including Alexander, of course, whose joyous<br>
    receptiveness is in concert with that of everyone<br>
    else).</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - 2/03/92 - ACT TWO 22.</p>

  <p> ACT THREE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>33 INT. TROI'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> A slightly rigid Troi confronts a thoroughly relaxed<br>
    Lwaxana.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother, I'm trying to help this<br>
    boy learn the value of<br>
    responsibility. You're not<br>
    helping by giving him a lot of<br>
    mixed messages.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    I exposed you to all sorts of<br>
    mixed messages at that age, and<br>
    you still turned out deadly dull;<br>
    what're you so worried about?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Among other things, his<br>
    relationship with his father.<br>
    No more holodeck, Mother. Please.<br>
    (Beat)<br>
    And why aren't you all absorbed<br>
    in your wedding plans? It's only<br>
    three days away.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Oh, I'm letting Mister Homn take<br>
    care of all the mundane details.<br>
    He knows my tastes.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (dubious)<br>
    Mother...</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    There's really nothing to do, you<br>
    nosey little girl. Campio's<br>
    already sent me his mother's<br>
    wedding gown, which Mister Homn<br>
    is now altering for me. Outside<br>
    of that...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Wedding gown? Mother. Stop.<br>
    Are you telling me you're not<br>
    going to be naked at your own<br>
    wedding?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - 2/03/92 - ACT THREE 24.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Campio is from a different planet<br>
    with different traditions. He<br>
    wouldn't approve of a traditional<br>
    Betazoid wedding, so I'm adapting;<br>
    simple as that.<br>
    (moves to replicator)<br>
    Care for some nice jestral tea,<br>
    dear?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I can't believe I'm hearing this<br>
    from the Heir to the Holy Rings<br>
    of Betazed; Holder of the Sacred<br>
    Chalice of Rixx.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Computer... jestral tea, please.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I think it's time you tell me<br>
    about this mysterious marriage<br>
    to a man you've never met.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Why shouldn't I get married if<br>
    I choose to? You make it all into<br>
    such a mystery. There is no<br>
    mystery, Deanna.</p>
  <p>34 ANGLE INCLUDING REPLICATOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As she's speaking -- and to her sudden great perplexion<br>
    -- she finds herself facing a very long, fat<br>
    sausage-like food which MATERIALIZES for her in the<br>
    replicator and sits in the tea cup.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    ... except about this Petrokian<br>
    sausage. All I wanted was a cup<br>
    of tea. Dear, I think your<br>
    replicator's having some sort of<br>
    nervous collapse.</p>
  <p>35 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Geordi and Data are running a diagnostic at their<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That may be... but we've still<br>
    got almost two hundred reports of<br>

  <p> Data REACTS to a BEEP from the console, with:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is an energy fluctuation<br>
    in one of the utility access<br>
    corridors.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p>36 INT. JEFFERIES TUBE</p>
  <p> Geordi and Data crawl toward us to a panel in immediate<br>

    at the ready.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Dash four three; here we are.</p>
  <p> Geordi scans around with his tricorder; homes in on<br>
    the small panel, with:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Some kind of intermittent E-M<br>
    field pattern. Give me a hand<br>
    here, will you, Data?</p>
  <p> Together, they remove the panel. Geordi picks up his<br>
    tricorder; scans.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    No plasma leakage... just a little<br>
    negative ion charging.</p>
  <p> Just as Geordi is about to put his hand up into the<br>
    space previously covered by the panel, viscous little<br>
    drops of orange substance DRIP from within the space<br>
    to the flooring right in front of Geordi's nose.</p>
  <p>37 INT. LWAXANA'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Lwaxana, wearing a not-unflattering wedding dress,<br>
    stands before a mirror as MISTER HOMN finishes<br>
    tailoring it on her. Homm wears a large pin cushion<br>
    around his forearm, and carries pins in his mouth.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Bad enough having to wear anything<br>
    at my own wedding. But this.<br>
    Maybe if we lower the bodice...</p>

    him toward her, during:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    My little warrior; come in, come<br>
    in and give me a hug.</p>
  <p> Alexander complies (hesitating only initially as he<br>
    has to pass the overwhelming Mister Homn on the way<br>
    in).</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (cont'd)<br>
    You're not escaping another<br>

    (cheerful again)<br>
    Now tell me; what brings you here<br>
    to brighten my day?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I wanted to say I'm sorry if I<br>
    got you in trouble.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    That's very sweet, dear. But I<br>
    really wasn't in any trouble...<br>
    until I saw this dress. Come sit<br>
    down.<br>
    (re: dress)<br>
    Ugly, isn't it?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    What's it for?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    I'm getting married.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Are you sure my daughter didn't<br>
    send you?<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    That's only a little joke.</p>
  <p> She now dismisses Mister Homn with a gesture which<br>
    sends him dutifully into the (o.s.) adjoining room.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (cont'd)<br>
    People get married because they<br>
    want to spend their lives with<br>
    someone.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Their whole life? I guess you'd<br>
    really have to like them a lot.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    If you're young... and lucky...<br>
    it'll be someone you like a lot,<br>
    yes.<br>

  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Are you very old?</p>
  <p> Initially, and for just an instant, Lwaxana shoots the<br>
    kid a look -- but then softens again, even more than<br>
    she has before. And now, she'll be staring ahead at<br>
    nothing but her own thoughts, as:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    I'm alone, Alex. And when you<br>
    do get older... when you can no<br>
    longer pick and choose from<br>
    whatever may come your way...<br>
    Well, then you do what we call<br>

  <p> Troi and Lwaxana wait as a Transporter Operator,<br>
    standing alongside his panel, causes CAMPIO and his<br>
    entourage of one, ERKO, to MATERIALIZE. Campio is a<br>
    fine-looking, mid-50's humanoid -- patrician in posture<br>
    and manner; eminently gracious. Erko is an older,<br>
    pompous-appearing stiff.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Ah! Campio!</p>
  <p> Lwaxana moves forward with both hands extended.<br>
    Campio, ever-polite, will step to meet her -- take her<br>
    hands in his, and regard her with most gracious and<br>
    complimentary admiration. Erko remains right where<br>
    he first appeared. Throughout the above:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (cont'd)<br>
    My dear, your compatibility<br>
    profile didn't do you justice. I,<br>
    of course, am Lwaxana, and any<br>
    introductory compliments you'd<br>
    care to make will be happily<br>
    received.</p>

    Indeed, Mrs. Troi... you are even<br>
    lovelier in person.</p>
  <p> Neither tastelessly, nor in an overbearing manner --<br>
    but merely in bright spirit and to be warmly welcoming<br>
    -- Lwaxana leans to kiss him on the cheek, with:</p>

    Please excuse my tardiness; ship's<br>
    duties. Minister Campio? I'm<br>
    Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the<br>
    Enterprise. Welcome aboard, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard extends his hand, but Campio -- still smiling<br>
    pleasantly and certainly not being a prig on purpose<br>
    -- ignores the outstretched hand and bows deeply and<br>
    with deference before Picard.</p>
  <p> CAMPIO<br>
    I thank you, Captain, and greet<br>
    you with appreciation for<br>
    permitting this wedding aboard<br>
    your fine vessel.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not at all, sir.</p>

    He is nonetheless welcome.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Campio, dear, personally I adore<br>
    every ounce of ostentation I can<br>
    get, but... a protocol master?</p>
  <p> CAMPIO<br>
    I would not do you nor our<br>
    benevolent hosts the disservice<br>
    of failing to ensure that<br>
    priorities are observed.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Oh, well that's... very<br>
    thoughtful.</p>
  <p> CAMPIO<br>
    After all, it would be<br>
    unpardonable to simply abandon<br>
    ourselves to the moment, would<br>
    it not?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (shellshocked)<br>
    Unpardonable.</p>

  <p> As Worf brings food for Alexander and himself, the boy<br>
    is doing a breathing exercise: Holding his hands<br>

    deeply -- holds it for a beat -- then exhales with a<br>
    loud and happy-faced blurt of:</p>

  <p> Alexander rises and moves toward the door, as:</p>

    Where are you going?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    You said no Klingon breaks his<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    I did not mean now. Now you will<br>

    confusing me.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (losing it)<br>
    Understand later. Now, just eat!</p>
  <p> Seeing Worf's overflowing frustration, Alexander's face<br>
    in no way reflects any kind of defiance -- but only a<br>
    gentle concern for his father's agitation -- which he<br>
    will attempt to soothe, with:</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>

  <p> WORF<br>

    Mother, we need to talk...</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    We certainly do, dear, but not<br>
    just now.<br>
    (to Erko)<br>
    How do I address him?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother, we've come for Alexander.<br>
    (to all)<br>
    Please forgive the intrusion,<br>
    but...</p>
  <p> ERKO<br>
    Preferably, he should be called<br>

    Ah. I'll remember. Mister Homn?<br>
    You make everybody comfortable<br>
    until we get back; especially...<br>
    (re: Campio)<br>
    ... the Minister.<br>
    (to Campio)<br>
    One hour, darling; see you then.</p>
  <p> She starts to leave, but Worf happens to be standing<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Mrs. Troi, it is Alexander's<br>
    dinner hour.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    How thoughtless of me.<br>
    (to Alex; brightly)<br>
    We'll have a little picnic before<br>
    the mudbath.</p>
  <p> CAMPIO<br>
    But we have business to deal with<br>
    here. Leaving is simply not<br>
    acceptable.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Oh, can't we pretend it's<br>
    acceptable? We'll be back.</p>
  <p> CAMPIO<br>
    You are missing the point.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Alexander, you will please return<br>
    to quarters and have your dinner.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    But we're going to the holodeck.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother, you are undermining every<br>
    effort we're trying to make<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Don't be absurd.</p>
  <p> ERKO<br>
    It is essential that the wedding<br>
    procedures be discussed now.</p>

  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Well, then... Minister, darling,<br>
    perhaps you and the Gerko there<br>
    can come with us.<br>
    (quick aside, to Troi)<br>
    Poor dear, don't they ever let<br>
    you change those colorless<br>

    Lwaxana, this exceeds all<br>

  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Oh. Well, half an hour, then.<br>
    No longer. I promise. Your<br>
    duties, Mister Homn.</p>
  <p> CAMPIO<br>
    Counselor Troi, have you no<br>
    influence?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Hah!</p>
  <p> Alexander, recognizing that sound, puts his hands<br>
    against his diaphragm (as we've seen him do earlier)<br>

  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Ha!</p>
  <p> CAMPIO<br>
    Lwaxana, if you will remain, I<br>
    may allow the boy to stay while<br>
    we...</p>
  <p> ERKO<br>
    Definitely not.</p>
  <p> At this point, Lwaxana and Alex will EXIT (o.s.).</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Definitely not. My son is to<br>
    return to quarters!</p>
  <p> ERKO<br>
    Nor may a servant be present<br>
    during a prenuptial consultation.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Well, sir, I'm afraid even the<br>

  <p> Those still present look around to discover that<br>
    Lwaxana and Alexander are, indeed, gone.</p>

    What happened?</p>
  <p> JUGGLER<br>
    I was just juggling... and I<br>
    happened to catch one in my mouth.<br>
    It tasted good, so I ate it. Then<br>
    before I knew it, I'd eaten every<br>

    When we saw that photonic<br>
    trail moving through the walls,<br>
    we realized we must be dealing<br>
    with a metal parasite of some<br>
    kind.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We believe the parasites came<br>
    through the ship's hull when we<br>
    destroyed the asteroid near Tessen<br>
    Three.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are they attacking anything other<br>
    than nitrium alloy?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not that we can tell. But we've<br>
    got nitrium everywhere --<br>
    ventilation, life support,<br>
    engines, computers... even in the<br>
    dilithium chamber.</p>
  <p> Picard takes this in, mulls it over.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - REV. 2/04/92 - ACT FIVE 47A.</p>
  <p>69 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data... you said the<br>
    asteroid we destroyed was rich<br>
    in nitrium...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That asteroid was from the<br>
    Pelloris Field... if the rest of<br>
    that field is rich in nitrium...<br>
    it would have been a natural<br>
    feeding ground.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We should think about going back<br>
    there... it's possible the<br>
    parasites could be lured back to<br>
    the asteroids... for a meal<br>
    that's more appealing than we<br>
    are.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long to the field, Mister<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, with our sensors unable<br>

    given the speed with which they<br>
    appear to be moving through the<br>
    ship --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    -- then we may not have five hours<br>
    and twenty minutes. I'm aware<br>
    of that. What can we do to slow<br>
    them down?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In several cases, an exanogen gas<br>
    barrier has been known to slow<br>
    the progress of metal parasites.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They don't like the cold, eh?<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The problem is finding them. By<br>
    the time we spot an energy<br>
    fluctuation, they've consumed all<br>
    the nitrium and moved on.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the lights DIM alarmingly. Geordi springs to<br>

  <p> A particle beam shoots from the ship to the nearest<br>
    asteroid. A beat -- and then masses of the &quot;Twinkling<br>

    asteroid.</p>

  <p>89 INT. BRIDGE (CONTINUOUS)</p>
  <p> Red Alert is off... People are beginning to regain<br>
    consciousness. Picard is waking up, trying to clear<br>
    his head.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Structural integrity of the<br>
    dilithium chamber is at<br>
    twenty-eight percent and holding.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data... ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The plan was successful, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well done...</p>
  <p> He looks around him, assessing the situation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf... coordinate your<br>
    teams with Doctor Crusher and<br>
    Commander La Forge... assess<br>
    damage and injury.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, Captain.</p>
  <p> And Picard takes deep breaths... sits a little<br>
    straighter... and realizes they've squeaked through<br>
    once again.</p>
  <p>90 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> moving at impulse.</p>

    Captain's log, stardate 45733.6.<br>
    Temporary repairs to the ship have<br>
    been completed.<br>

    Our attention now turns to matters<br>
    of a more festive nature.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - 2/03/92 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>91 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> From somewhere (o.s.), formal (dull) wedding music<br>
    plays. At the makeshift altar stands Erko, who is to<br>
    officiate. To his right, Picard and Riker; to his<br>
    left, Troi and Alexander. In the center stands the<br>
    ritually robed, pleasantly expectant Campio. All await<br>
    the (o.s.) bride.</p>
  <p>92 CLOSE - PICARD &amp; RIKER</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (thru closed lips)<br>
    You'd think she'd at least get<br>
    to her own wedding on time.</p>
  <p> The music now swells.</p>
  <p>93 INCLUDING LWAXANA (AS DESIRED)</p>
  <p> She is smiling infectiously, happily, at everyone.<br>
    Though we see only noncensorable parts of her, it is<br>
    obvious that she has made this appearance STARK NAKED.</p>
  <p>94 CLOSE REACTION - CAMPIO</p>
  <p> Thunderstruck.</p>
  <p>95 ERKO</p>
  <p> Open-mouthed, wide-eyed horror.</p>
  <p>96 TROI</p>
  <p> The beginnings of a relieved, certainly understanding,<br>
    smile.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - REV. 2/05/92 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>97 CLOSE ON LWAXANA</p>
  <p> She not only saves her most radiant expression for (the<br>
    o.s.) Alexander, but throws him a conspiratorial WINK<br>
    to boot.</p>
  <p>98 CLOSE ON ALEXANDER</p>
  <p> In response, he once again grins happily from ear to<br>
    ear.</p>
  <p>99 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Erko takes Campio's arm.</p>
  <p> ERKO<br>
    Minister, this is infamous.<br>
    Infamous!... We leave immediately!</p>
  <p> The speechless Campio is literally led off by his irked<br>
    Erko.</p>
  <p>100 ON LWAXANA</p>
  <p> She shrugs. C'est la vie, folks.</p>
  <p>101 EXT. EDGE OF SHIRALEAN GLADE - DAY - CLOSE ON<br>
    LWAXANA</p>
  <p> She sits contentedly in the mudbath... draws a deep<br>
    breath of contentment.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Ahhhhh... heavenly. Every pore<br>
    is tingling with contentment...</p>
  <p> A beat as she turns her head; camera WIDENS to show<br>
    Alexander sitting next to her.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Isn't it wonderful how things work<br>
    out, Alexander? I wanted to teach<br>
    you how to grab the joys of<br>
    life... and then you turned<br>
    around and taught me not to let<br>
    go of them. How very mutual...</p>
  <p> WIDEN FURTHER to discover that, alongside Alex, sits<br>
    Troi, as:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - REV. 2/05/92 - ACT FIVE 57A.</p>
  <p>101 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We still have to learn how to live<br>
    in the real world. All of us,<br>
    Mother.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    When necessary; yes.<br>
    (to Alex)<br>
    She is right about that,<br>
    Alexander.<br>
    (sotto)<br>
    But only when necessary.</p>
  <p> Now WIDEN AGAIN to reveal, seated alongside Troi, Worf.<br>
    He alone is utterly blank-faced as the others enjoy<br>
    themselves. He peers first at the others; then down<br>
    at the mud; then:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (lost)<br>
    You're just supposed to sit<br>
    here?</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p>23 INCLUDING YOUNG MAN AND WOMAN</p>
  <p> Emerging from one of the tents are a YOUNG, extremely<br>
    attractive (humanoid) MAN and WOMAN.</p>
  <p> JUGGLER<br>
    (to Young Couple)<br>
    We're having guests for laughing<br>
    hour. Come join us!</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    We'd love to!</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    No, thank you.</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    (pleasantly)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    (pleasantly)<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    Why do you always say &quot;no&quot; when<br>
    I say &quot;yes&quot;?</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    I don't.</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    You just did.</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    There you go again. You are the<br>
    most negative person!</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    You're the one who said &quot;no.&quot;</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    Now it's my fault?</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    I didn't say anything about fault.</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    Yes, you did.</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    You're wrong, as usual.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - 2/03/92 - APPENDIX 2.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    I'm not usually wrong. I'm never<br>
    wrong.</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    You're wrong if you think you're<br>
    never wrong.</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    And you're being negative again!</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    I most certainly am not!</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    You just were -- you're being<br>
    negative when you say you're not<br>
    negative!</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    And you're being stubborn and<br>
    narrow-minded.</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    You could not be more wrong. As<br>
    usual.</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    I'm not usually wrong. I'm never<br>
    wrong.</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    You're wrong if you think you're<br>
    never wrong.</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    Now who's being negative?</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    You.</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    I don't think so. You are the<br>
    most negative person.</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    How can you say that? It's simply<br>
    not true.</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    Every time you open your mouth,<br>
    you say something negative.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cost of Living&quot; - 2/03/92 - APPENDIX 3.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    You're the one who is negative.<br>
    You negate everything I say.</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    I do not.</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    And you are extremely stubborn.</p>
  <p> YOUNG MAN<br>
    I am not. You are!</p>
  <p> YOUNG WOMAN<br>
    I - am - not!</p>
