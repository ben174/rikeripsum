  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45233.1.<br>
    Our terraforming mission to Doraf<br>
    One has been suddenly cancelled<br>
    and the Enterprise recalled to<br>
    Starbase Two-thirty-four. Fleet<br>
    Admiral Brackett would not discuss<br>
    the matter on subspace for<br>
    reasons she said would soon be<br>
    clear...</p>
  <p>2 INT. ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL BRACKETT, regal and poised as ever, with PICARD.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - REV. 9/18/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL BRACKETT<br>
    I apologize for the mystery,<br>
    Captain... but we must attempt<br>
    to contain the information I'm<br>
    about to reveal to you... at least<br>
    as long as possible...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will admit you've piqued my<br>
    curiosity, Admiral.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL BRACKETT<br>
    Three weeks ago, one of our most<br>
    celebrated ambassadors -- an<br>
    advisor to Federation leaders for<br>
    generations -- disappeared. He<br>
    left no word of his destination.</p>
  <p> Brackett moves toward Picard's desk, and activates his<br>
    computer.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL BRACKETT<br>
    Two days ago, intelligence reports<br>
    placed him on Romulus -- and I<br>
    assure you it's an unauthorized<br>
    visit. Computer, initiate linkage<br>
    between this terminal and starbase<br>
    computer system alpha-two-nine.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Linkage complete.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A defection?</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL BRACKETT<br>
    If it is, the damage to Federation<br>
    security would be incalculable.</p>
  <p> Brackett taps a few instructions and then gestures for<br>
    Picard to look.</p>
  <p>3 INSERT - MONITOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A fuzzy, out-of-focus picture, with margins showing<br>
    on screen, comes into frame -- something obviously<br>
    taken on a very long lens. There are several blurred<br>
    figures, none of them identifiable.</p>

  <p> as the blurred images come into sharper relief... the<br>
    center one particularly... and as it becomes focused,<br>
    we recognize the unmistakable image of Spock, dressed<br>
    in Romulan clothing.</p>
  <p>4B BACK TO SCENE</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> coming out of warp.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45236.4.<br>
    As I study the intelligence<br>
    reports on Ambassador Spock's<br>
    disappearance, I cannot help but<br>
    feel a deeper, more personal<br>
    concern about this mission, for<br>
    I know this man through his<br>
    father. It was barely a year ago<br>
    that I shared a mind meld with<br>
    the Vulcan Sarek... now we must<br>
    meet again as I attempt to find<br>
    an explanation for his son's<br>
    actions.</p>
  <p> (Part of the log can fall over the following --)</p>
  <p>5A INT. ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Moving along several PADDs spread out across the<br>
    table... as well as other reports... clearly Picard<br>
    has been doing a great deal of homework... but as we<br>
    find him he is musing, staring out the window at the<br>
    stars... Riker ENTERS...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'll be coming into orbit of<br>
    Vulcan in less than an hour,<br>
    Captain... you may want to get<br>
    some rest...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, yes, of course, you're<br>
    right...</p>
  <p> But he doesn't get up, his eye is caught by another<br>
    PADD on his desk... he's tired, but his mind is busy...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p>5A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We should notify Sarek's wife of<br>
    our plans...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All taken care of, sir... she'll<br>
    be transporting aboard at oh-seven<br>
    hundred...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And Sarek?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    She says he is too ill to join<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Not unexpected. The man is dying.<br>
    And I have the... honor... to<br>
    bring him the news that his son<br>
    may have betrayed the Federation.</p>
  <p> Riker sits.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How well do you know Spock?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I met him only once... what I know<br>
    of him comes from history books<br>
    and of course the mind meld with<br>
    his father...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That must cover a lot of ground...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>5A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not as much as you'd imagine...<br>
    Sarek and Spock...</p>
  <p> He pauses, inclined not to go any deeper into this...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... Well, sometimes, fathers and<br>
    sons...</p>
  <p> He doesn't need to finish...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (from personal<br>
    experience)<br>
    Understood.</p>
  <p> Picard nods, rises and Riker follows suit... Picard<br>
    gets an additional thought... he picks up a PADD...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh there was one other thing...<br>
    take a look at this...</p>
  <p> Hands it to Riker, who glances at it, raises an<br>
    eyebrow...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Something that turned up during<br>
    the intelligence sweep... what<br>
    do you make of it?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: the PADD)<br>
    Metal fragments, possibly<br>
    disassembled components,<br>
    identified as Vulcan... recovered<br>
    from a downed Ferengi ship...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And the crates they were in were<br>
    marked as medical supplies.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Contraband?</p>
  <p> Picard shakes his head, doesn't know... as they EXIT...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE 6A.</p>
  <p>5A CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They've been sent to Vulcan for<br>
    identification... Starfleet has<br>
    requested we lend them a hand...</p>
  <p> Riker acknowledges and they're out...</p>
  <p>5B EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit of Vulcan.</p>
  <p>6 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard waits with a TRANSPORTER OFFICER as PERRIN<br>
    MATERIALIZES on the pad. She walks forward, extending<br>
    her arms, obviously glad to see Picard again. She is<br>
    as lovely and gracious as ever, her eyes holding the<br>
    only clue to the pain she carries from Sarek's illness.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Captain Picard...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perrin...</p>
  <p> They shake hands and start toward the door.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    It's good to see you again.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And you. How is Sarek?</p>
  <p> They EXIT the transporter room.</p>
  <p>7 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as they walk toward a turbolift.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    He has good days... and bad days.<br>
    More and more they're bad...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then the disease has progressed...</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    It is a cruel killer. Sarek<br>
    deserves a noble death... instead<br>
    he is trapped in this lingering<br>
    madness...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It must be very hard for you.</p>
  <p> She casts him a swift glance. Not many people ever<br>
    think of her feelings, her needs. She is grateful for<br>
    Picard's sensitivity.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Every day I can share with him<br>
    is a gift. The pain will be in<br>
    losing him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hope that will not be soon.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    There's no way to tell. At times<br>
    I think he won't make it through<br>
    another night... and then it seems<br>
    he's strong enough to live for<br>
    years...</p>
  <p> They walk quietly for a beat, then --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I admire your strength more than<br>
    I can tell you.</p>
  <p> Again, she gives him a sidelong glance, but he's<br>
    looking straight ahead. They walk on in silence.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>8 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard is at the replicator, just removing two cups<br>
    of tea. He gives her a cup of steaming tea and she<br>
    takes it, inhaling the vapor.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Mint tea... it's been years since<br>
    I've had it... Vulcans have some<br>
    strange concoction they call<br>
    &quot;mint&quot;... but you wouldn't<br>
    recognize it...</p>
  <p> She sips at it, turning away to look out the windows.<br>
    Picard regards her for a moment, realizing she is<br>
    reluctant to get into discussion of the real purpose<br>
    of his visit. But he has no such luxury.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perrin... you know why I've come<br>
    to Vulcan.</p>
  <p> She seems to stiffen a moment, doesn't turn around,<br>
    doesn't answer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I must ask you about Spock.</p>
  <p> Now she turns, and there's a bitterness in her eyes<br>
    that can't be concealed.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    He didn't even say good-bye to<br>
    his father before he left.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is it possible he was abducted?</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    No. He wrapped up his affairs<br>
    very carefully. He knew he was<br>
    going.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you have any idea why he might<br>
    have disappeared like this?</p>
  <p> Perrin drills him a look, works to get under control.<br>
    This whole subject is clearly a sore spot with her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Captain, as far as I'm concerned<br>
    he disappeared a long time ago.</p>
  <p> She rises, trying to contain her emotions...</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Excuse me for sounding like the<br>
    wicked stepmother...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Would it be inappropriate to ask<br>
    what happened between you and<br>
    Spock?</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Not between us. Between Spock<br>
    and his father. They had argued<br>
    for years; that was family...<br>
    but when the debates over the<br>
    Cardassian war began, he attacked<br>
    Sarek's position... publicly...<br>
    he showed no loyalty to his<br>
    father...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was not aware that Sarek was<br>
    offended by Spock's opposition...</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    I was offended. And I made sure<br>
    Spock knew it.<br>
    (beat, softer)<br>
    I am very protective of my<br>
    husband. I do not apologize for<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Would Sarek have any idea why<br>
    Spock might have left?</p>
  <p> Perrin turns and walks away from him, pauses at a<br>
    distance, hesitates before answering. If it were<br>
    anyone else, she would never become so personal, so<br>
    revealing...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE 9A.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    I don't know.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If you could see Sarek as I do...<br>
    wasting in bed... whispering to<br>
    himself...</p>
  <p> She turns back to Picard, in anguish.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    He wants to see his son... to heal<br>
    any rifts that still remain...<br>
    but now it may be too late.</p>
  <p> Her voice breaks and she turns away, not wanting to<br>
    lose control in front of Picard. He is sobered by her<br>
    distress.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (gently)<br>
    Perrin... would you allow me to<br>
    see Sarek?</p>
  <p> She turns back, suffering in her eyes. Hesitates.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    If it were anyone else... I would<br>
    never permit it.</p>
  <p> A beat as she looks into his eyes. Deciding --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    But you are a part of him... and<br>
    he of you...</p>
  <p> And on Picard's reaction...</p>
  <p>8A INT. CARGO BAY</p>
  <p> Riker and GEORDI stand looking over an unusual scene.<br>
    Spread out on the floor of the bay are fragments of<br>
    metal -- big, small, irregular, symmetrical, most of<br>
    them charred and twisted beyond recognition.<br>
    SUPERNUMERARIES, with tricorders, scanners, etc. are<br>
    moving the fragments around, trying to arrange them<br>
    into a cohesive pattern. In evidence are the broken<br>
    remains of the containers which once housed the<br>
    fragments.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Vulcans can't figure out what<br>
    these fragments are... but<br>
    they've identified the metal as<br>
    a dentarium alloy.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That pretty well indicates<br>
    that they're Vulcan...<br>

    And dentarium also means that<br>
    whatever this was, it was designed<br>
    for use in space.</p>

    A Ferengi cargo shuttle that went<br>
    down in the Hanolin asteroid<br>
    belt... the debris was spread over<br>
    one hundred square kilometers.</p>
  <p> Riker and Geordi pick their way through the strange<br>
    assortment of metal chunks. Riker picks up part of<br>
    a damaged container. Geordi picks up a metal fragment,<br>
    plays his tricorder on it.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Could it be a weapons array?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That was my first thought. But<br>
    the Vulcans don't have any record<br>
    of stolen weapons. Or stolen<br>
    parts, for that matter.</p>
  <p> Geordi surveys the mess, shaking his head.</p>

    This is gonna be like putting<br>
    together a big jig-saw puzzle when<br>
    you don't know what the picture<br>
    is supposed to be.</p>
  <p> Riker acknowledges and as both men begin to seek a way<br>

  <p>10 INT. SAREK'S CEREMONIAL DEATH CHAMBER</p>
  <p> Sarek rests on a raised bed in an otherwise Spartan<br>
    room. His head, resting on a pillow, is turned toward<br>
    sunlight. Tears have coursed a pattern on his face<br>
    and dried in rivulets. His mouth moves faintly, but<br>
    no sound emerges. Perrin and Picard stand at the<br>
    doorway, Picard noticeably shocked by this<br>
    deterioration in Sarek's condition.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    He's like this most of the time...<br>
    his emotions have taken over.</p>
  <p> She moves toward the bed, followed by Picard. Sarek's<br>
    lips keep moving.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Sometimes I can bring him out of<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> She reaches the bed, leans in to her husband. When<br>
    she speaks it is sharply, harshly, demandingly.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Sarek! You will listen!</p>
  <p> Sarek snarls in rage, anger suddenly replacing pathos.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    Go from me!</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Picard is here.</p>
  <p> In reply, Sarek pounds his fists on the bed.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    No -- more -- chaos!</p>
  <p> Perrin turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    I'll leave you alone. He'll<br>
    either acknowledge you... or he<br>
    won't.</p>
  <p> He nods and she EXITS. Picard is alone with the<br>
    furious man. He takes his cue from Perrin, and speaks<br>
    firmly, authoritatively.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sarek, I have come a long way to<br>
    see you.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    I will not answer -- !</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I must speak to you about your<br>
    son...</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    I want no one with me --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    About Spock.</p>
  <p> Sarek suddenly goes silent. He doesn't look at Picard,<br>
    and there is no indication that he truly understands.<br>
    But then his head slowly turns, his eyes focus on<br>
    Picard. When he speaks, his voice is quiet.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    Spock?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. He's missing.</p>
  <p> A flicker in Sarek's eyes as he moves into the reality<br>
    of the present, recognition dawning.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    Is that you, Picard... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, my friend.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    You came here... to Vulcan...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I need your help. I must find<br>
    Spock.</p>
  <p> Tears spring to Sarek's eyes as his emotions overcome<br>
    him once more. He lets out a sob, then struggles for<br>
    the precious control that is so elusive.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    He is not here...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know. He is reported on<br>
    Romulus.</p>
  <p> Sarek fixes him with a hard look. He is trying to<br>
    regain control, concentrate on the moment, even though<br>
    it costs him considerable effort.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    On Romulus... why?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's what I hope to find out<br>
    from you.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    On Romulus...</p>
  <p> He is silent for a moment, musing. When he looks at<br>
    Picard again, his eyes are clear.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    You're going there, aren't you?<br>
    To find him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Sarek rises now, sits upright. It is as though purpose<br>
    has given him focus.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Have you any idea what might have<br>
    taken him to Romulus?</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there anyone on Romulus that<br>
    he might know... or choose to<br>
    contact?</p>
  <p> A vague memory stirs for Sarek.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    Pardek...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Who is Pardek?</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    It could be Pardek...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Who is Pardek?</p>
  <p> Sarek gets out of bed. He is becoming energized.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    He is a Romulan Senator. Spock<br>
    has maintained a relationship with<br>
    him over the years... I don't know<br>
    where they met. The Khitomer<br>
    Conference, I'd imagine.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Pardek represented Romulus?</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    Yes... yes I'm quite sure he<br>
    did...</p>
  <p> He begins to pace. He is suffused with energy, leonine<br>
    and magnificent...</p>

  <p>10 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    ... in fact I recall Spock coming<br>
    to me with optimism about a<br>
    continuing dialogue with the<br>
    Romulans at one point... and I<br>
    told him it was clearly an<br>
    illogical expectation... Spock<br>
    is always so impressionable...<br>
    this Romulan Pardek had no support<br>
    at home... and of course in the<br>
    end, I was proven correct.</p>
  <p> He looks at Picard, shrugs as though to say, &quot;How do<br>
    you tell a child what to do?&quot;</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    I tried to give him the benefit<br>
    of experience, of logic... but<br>
    he never listened. He never<br>
    listened...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> Now Sarek has lost the train of thought, and,<br>
    disoriented, turns away. Picard tries to get his<br>
    attention.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It has been suggested... that<br>
    Spock may have defected.</p>
  <p> Sarek turns back, puzzled. He has lost the context.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    Never. I can accept many things,<br>
    but not that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But you believe he might be there<br>
    to see Pardek...</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    The Romulan Senator? How do you<br>
    know Pardek?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (not worth going into)<br>
    I've heard of him.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    That's what he's done. Gone to<br>
    see Pardek.</p>
  <p> Sarek returns to the bed... exhausted now...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you know what business they<br>
    could have together?</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    No.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I never knew what Spock was doing.<br>
    When he was a boy, he would<br>
    disappear for days into the<br>
    mountains.<br>

    I asked him where he had gone,<br>
    what he had done... he refused<br>
    to answer. I insisted he tell<br>
    me... but he would not. I forbade<br>
    him to go... he ignored me. I<br>
    punished him... he endured it<br>
    silently. And always, he returned<br>
    to the mountains.<br>

    One might as well tell the river<br>
    not to flow...</p>
  <p> Sarek seeks Picard's eyes... he is beginning to lose<br>
    his control... tears overwhelm him...</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    Secretly... I admired him... that<br>
    proud core of him that would not<br>
    yield...</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (softly)<br>
    Sarek, we are a part of each<br>
    other. I know Spock has caused<br>
    you pain... but I also know you<br>
    love him...</p>
  <p> Tears are threatening to overwhelm Sarek.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    Tell him, Picard...</p>
  <p> His eyes begin to glaze over slightly, and he struggles<br>
    to maintain control for a moment longer. He looks<br>
    toward one of his hands, and tries to form his fingers<br>
    in the Vulcan salute... the fingers won't obey. They<br>
    tremble and shift position and just won't go where they<br>
    should. Gently, Picard reaches over and puts them<br>
    right. Sarek smiles and holds the hand toward him.<br>
    Picard then forms the salute himself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Peace and long life, Sarek.</p>

    his mind losing reality. He turns away, his mind<br>

    senator for nine decades. He is<br>
    considered a &quot;man of the<br>
    people... &quot; He has sponsored many<br>
    reforms. Reportedly, he is<br>
    considered by the Romulan<br>

    willing to help me. And then they<br>
    would have our gratitude.</p>
  <p> That hangs in the air for a second.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Also please tell him that I am<br>
    immensely gratified that he is<br>
    prospering so well. It is a<br>
    tribute to his skilled leadership.</p>
  <p> B'ijik inclines his head, and the screen returns to<br>

  <p> Picard and Data with Beverly. She is examining Data's<br>
    ears with a 24th-century tech ear instrument...<br>
    meanwhile a SUPERNUMERARY is coating one of Picard's<br>
    ears with a plastic substance.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    They aren't removable, are they,<br>

  <p> DATA<br>

    No, Doctor... they are fully<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to the supernumerary)<br>
    We'll need molds of his ears<br>
    too...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What about his skin color?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT TWO 25A.</p>
  <p>14C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We'll have to do some tests with<br>
    his skin pigmentation. Changing<br>
    it to appear Romulan shouldn't<br>
    be too hard... I just want to be<br>
    sure we can change it back again<br>
    afterwards.</p>
  <p> She takes a set of optical calipers from a stand and<br>
    measures Picard's head... as Riker ENTERS... intrigued<br>
    by these proceedings...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The right eye is point-zero-zero-<br>
    four higher than the left...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    It is not...</p>

  <p> The supernumerary puts the ear mold on Data...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: the eyes)<br>
    I won't tell a soul, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Anything from Gowron?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Nosir. But after your tailor is<br>
    done, would you join me in the<br>
    cargo bay... La Forge has made<br>
    some progress on those metal<br>
    fragments...</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why would anyone want a Vulcan<br>
    deflector?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Beats me, Commander. Every<br>

    bring up two more.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're certain it is Vulcan...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, sir. A metallurgical<br>

  <p>15A EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND BIRD OF PREY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p>15B INT. KLINGON BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Data, and the Klingon Captain, K'VADA. He is a<br>
    burly man whose days of warrior glory are probably<br>
    behind him; he's not thrilled about this assignment<br>
    to ferry two wimp Starfleet officers across the Neutral<br>
    Zone. He responds by being confrontational and<br>
    challenging. During the next, Data wanders the bridge,<br>
    scoping out the computer equipment.</p>
  <p> K'VADA<br>
    When I received my orders... I<br>
    was not told where we were going.</p>
  <p> No response from Picard.</p>
  <p> K'VADA<br>
    But the heading I was given...<br>
    takes us into the Neutral Zone...<br>
    and to Romulus.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's right.</p>
  <p> K'VADA<br>
    I know my duty, Captain... when<br>
    I'm given orders, I follow them.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I do not like secrets. I want<br>
    to know why we are on this<br>
    mission.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry. It is a confidential<br>
    matter.</p>

    You're going after the defector,<br>
    aren't you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (impassive)<br>
    Defector...</p>
  <p> K'VADA<br>
    You think information like that<br>
    stays a secret? Ambassador Spock<br>
    has gone to Romulus... and you're<br>
    going after him.</p>
  <p> Picard regards him evenly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your orders are to take us to a<br>
    set of coordinates near Romulus...<br>
    and to bring us back. That is<br>
    all I am prepared to discuss.</p>
  <p> K'VADA<br>
    If we are discovered by the<br>
    Romulans... it means death for<br>
    all of us.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I realize that.</p>
  <p> There is a beat more, with Picard holding the Klingon<br>
    Captain's look. Then, accepting the fact that he will<br>
    be getting no more information, K'Vada turns to his<br>
    helmsman.</p>
  <p> K'VADA<br>
    Hechu' ghoS...<br>

    Very well, Captain. We have set<br>

  <p> The door to the quarters opens and K'vada ENTERS,<br>
    followed by Picard and Data. A beat as he surveys the<br>
    room. Then, with thinly veiled sarcasm --</p>
  <p> K'VADA<br>
    It may not be what you're used<br>
    to on a Starfleet ship.</p>
  <p> Picard and Data look around the quarters to see --</p>
  <p>19 THE ROOM - THEIR POV</p>
  <p> A bleak, uncomfortable room, Spartan in its<br>
    furnishings; the bed is a shelf recessed in the wall;<br>
    it is dark, dingy, and gives the impression of a place<br>
    that has been unused for years.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Quite nice. Thank you.</p>
  <p> Picard knows that K'Vada is spoiling for a fight...<br>
    and he sees nothing to gain by giving him one. His<br>
    refusal to be drawn in becomes increasingly frustrating<br>
    to K'Vada.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Is this the captain's quarters,<br>
    or mine?</p>
  <p> K'VADA<br>
    Both.</p>
  <p> Off their surprised reactions --</p>

  <p> K'VADA<br>
    We have limited space. We're a<br>
    military ship, not a pleasure<br>
    craft.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course. This will be fine.</p>
  <p> K'vada, enjoying their discomfiture, strolls the room<br>
    like a hotel bellboy, pointing out the features. He<br>
    smacks his hand on the shelf-bed -- no mattress there.</p>
  <p> K'VADA<br>
    You'll sleep Klingon style... we<br>
    don't soften our bodies by putting<br>
    down a pad...</p>
  <p> Picard smacks the shelf himself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good. I prefer it that way.</p>
  <p> K'VADA<br>
    You'll take your meals with us...<br>
    and we don't serve Federation<br>
    food.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I haven't had gagh in a while...<br>
    been looking forward to it. Very<br>

  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He is of a race called Zakdorn, noted for their<br>
    self-assuredness and confidence. This translates into<br>
    someone who is officious, fastidious, and pushy.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm Commander William Riker of<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    We need some information about<br>
    a Vulcan ship, the T'Pau. It was<br>

  <p> DOKACHIN<br>
    Did you arrange an appointment?</p>
  <p> Riker looks a bit startled.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Appointment... no...</p>
  <p> DOKACHIN<br>
    Then I will be unable to help you.<br>
    You may communicate with<br>
    scheduling.</p>
  <p> And the transmission goes back to starfield. Riker is<br>
    nonplussed. He turns to Troi.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Who does he think he is?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The quartermaster of the surplus<br>
    yard, Commander. With information<br>
    you need.</p>
  <p> He eyes her a moment, gets her point.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Right. Mister Worf...<br>

    Mister Dokaychin...</p>
  <p> DOKACHIN<br>
    Dokahchin... Klim Dokahchin...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Dokahchin, the information<br>
    I need involves a matter of major<br>
    importance to the Federation.</p>
  <p> DOKACHIN<br>
    (unimpressed)<br>
    Uh huh.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll need access to your logs,<br>
    your files...<br>
    (beat - no answer)<br>
    It won't take long. My people<br>
    can do the work.</p>
  <p> DOKACHIN<br>
    I don't allow outsiders into my<br>
    computer system.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Fine. One of your people, then.</p>
  <p> DOKACHIN<br>
    I wish I had the people to spare.<br>
    I don't.</p>
  <p> Riker is starting to get steamed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well, sir... what would you<br>
    suggest?</p>
  <p> DOKACHIN<br>
    I don't know. Contact me when<br>
    you reach orbit.</p>
  <p> And the starfield returns once more. Riker turns to<br>
    Troi.</p>

  <p> Riker, Geordi, and Troi are standing at an aft science<br>
    station as the turbolift opens and Worf and Dokachin<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you for coming on board,<br>
    Mister Dokachin.</p>
  <p> Dokachin is still rubber-necking.</p>
  <p> DOKACHIN<br>
    Quite a ship you have.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've tied into your computers.<br>
    If you could access the files...</p>
  <p> DOKACHIN<br>
    I don't usually see them in such<br>
    good condition. By the time they<br>
    get to me, they're always falling<br>
    apart.</p>
  <p> Riker appeals to Troi with his eyes, and she moves<br>

    himself by her gently stroking demeanor.</p>
  <p> DOKACHIN<br>
    Who're you?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Deanna Troi, Ship's Counselor.</p>
  <p> He nods, without looking at Riker, talking about him...</p>
  <p> DOKACHIN<br>
    He probably figures we don't get<br>
    to see a lot of handsome women<br>
    out this way -- and someone like<br>
    you might get a little more<br>
    cooperation from me.</p>
  <p> Troi and Riker exchange a glance. A beat.</p>
  <p> DOKACHIN<br>
    He's probably right.</p>
  <p> He moves to a console.</p>
  <p> DOKACHIN<br>

  <p> DOKACHIN<br>
    It was routed to the Tripoli, a<br>
    holding vessel on the outer rim<br>
    of the shipyard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's not there anymore. What's<br>
    left of that deflector is laid<br>
    out on the floor of our cargo bay.</p>
  <p> Dokachin is stricken. His system, his efficiency,<br>

  <p> Picard and Data surveying the room.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    These quarters were obviously<br>
    intended for only one crewmember,<br>
    sir. There is a single sleeping<br>
    space.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure the Klingons found it<br>
    amusing to put us together in<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Since I do not require sleep, I<br>
    propose you take the --<br>
    (not sure what to call<br>
    the hole in the wall)<br>
    -- shelf. I will be content to<br>
    stand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well, Mister Data. Thank<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> Picard maneuvers past him toward the shelf in the wall,<br>
    eyes it. It is truly unappealing. With resignation,<br>
    he crawls into it -- an ungainly and difficult<br>
    proceeding. He finally accomplishes the task and finds<br>
    himself lying on his back staring at the top of the<br>
    shelf not far from his eyes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Are you comfortable, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I suppose so.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Good-night, Captain. Sleep well.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    I was processing the information<br>
    we have accumulated on Romulan<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Would you like me to discontinue?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, no. Please go ahead.</p>
  <p> And he shuts his eyes again. Holds them shut... then<br>
    opens them again. He sees Data staring right at him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What are you looking at?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am not looking at anything, sir.<br>
    I am continuing to organize my<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    But you're looking at me.</p>

    I am sorry if I am disturbing you,<br>

    I don't think so. Shall we<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    I would be happy to.<br>
    (launching in without<br>
    further ado)<br>
    I have been studying the Krocton<br>

    we must also tell him his father<br>
    is dead.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am afraid I do not entirely<br>

    would not Ambassador Spock simply<br>
    see death as a logical result of<br>
    his father's illness... ?</p>

    I'll see to it.</p>
  <p> He turns and heads toward the door. We see his face<br>
    and it is impassive; over his shoulder, Neral watches<br>
    him carefully.</p>
  <p>37 EXT. ROMULAN STREET - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> This neighborhood is bleak, drab, severe. The people<br>
    are joyless, grim, hurrying along without interacting<br>
    with each other. There is the feeling that life is<br>
    difficult here, and everyone pretty much looks out for<br>
    himself.</p>
  <p> Picard and Data ENTER, talking quietly, looking around.<br>
    There are other small clumps of people doing so... they<br>
    reflect the same dismal expressions as the Romulans...<br>
    not making eye contact.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This is definitely the street on<br>
    which the intelligence scan<br>
    of Spock and Pardek was taken,<br>
    sir... adjusting for the optical<br>
    distortion, I am able to verify<br>
    the architectural features...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where were they standing?</p>
  <p> Data does some processing, scanning the street, with a<br>
    few android movements... a few people glance at them,<br>
    Picard reacts... puts his arm around Data's shoulder,<br>
    smiles, in a friendly pose for the sake of onlookers...<br>
    sotto --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - REV. 9/17/91 - ACT FIVE 50A.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're moving about in a very...<br>
    well, android manner...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am sorry, Captain. I will be<br>
    more careful.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And don't call me &quot;Captain.&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Cap --<br>
    (cutting himself off)<br>
    I understand.<br>
    (looks around)<br>
    I have located the place where<br>
    they were standing...</p>
  <p> Picard breaks the arm contact.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where?</p>
  <p> Now, Data puts his arm around Picard's shoulder, as<br>
    Picard reacts, leading him a few doorways away...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is here --<br>
    (gestures)<br>
    -- at this doorway.</p>
  <p> There is a small Romulan sign near the door. (Data<br>
    drops his arm.) Reading...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A legal intercessor's office...<br>
    the name is similar to Pardek's.<br>
    It would appear to be one of<br>
    his relatives.</p>
  <p> Picard tries the door; it is locked.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not open for business yet...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Nevertheless, it would be my<br>
    recommendation that we keep this<br>
    location under observation.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT FIVE 50B.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA (cont'd)<br>
    I have clearly determined<br>
    Pardek's routine. On days when<br>
    the Senate is not in session, he<br>
    invariably comes to this section<br>
    after the median hour.</p>
  <p> Picard looks around, sizing up the situation. He sees<br>
    tables, people eating -- a kind of &quot;cafe.&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well, why don't we take the<br>
    opportunity to try some of the<br>
    local cuisine...</p>
  <p> The two saunter toward the cafe, passing some ROMULAN<br>
    FOOTSOLDIERS as they do. (One of these is ROMULAN #1<br>
    from Part II.) Picard and Data keep their eyes<br>
    straight ahead.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - REV. 9/17/91 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>37A ANGLE - AT CAFE</p>
  <p> They move to stand, like others, at a table. A WOMAN<br>
    appears before them... rather dour-looking, with hard,<br>
    suspicious eyes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What do you recommend?</p>
  <p> SOUP WOMAN<br>
    Soup.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That sounds very appealing. I<br>
    will have soup.</p>
  <p> The woman looks at Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Soup is fine.</p>
  <p> She moves off to get the soup. Picard and Data glance<br>
    around, trying to get a sense of how they're fitting<br>
    in.</p>
  <p>37A THE FOOTSOLDIERS</p>
  <p> are standing nearby.</p>
  <p>37A PICARD AND DATA</p>
  <p> as the woman returns and places two bowls of soup in<br>
    front of them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (friendly)<br>
    Do you happen to know what time<br>
    the intercessor's office across<br>
    the way opens?</p>
  <p> SOUP WOMAN<br>
    Why do you want to know?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    I need his services... he was<br>
    recommended.</p>
  <p> SOUP WOMAN<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I haven't seen you here before.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT FIVE 51A.</p>
  <p>37AB CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We are here for the day... from<br>
    the city of Rateg.</p>
  <p> SOUP WOMAN<br>
    Rateg. I don't think so.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Why do you say that?</p>
  <p> SOUP WOMAN<br>
    You don't sound like you're from<br>
    Rateg.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is a misconception that all<br>
    Rategs speak with a particular<br>
    inflection. In fact, there are<br>
    twelve different --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    We come from several kilometers<br>
    outside the city...</p>
  <p> SOUP WOMAN<br>
    (studies them a beat)<br>
    Or perhaps you come from the<br>
    security forces, to watch the<br>
    intercessor's office. Is he in<br>
    trouble?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Madam, you are mistaken.</p>
  <p> SOUP WOMAN<br>
    It doesn't matter to me. I don't<br>
    know when he opens. Eat your<br>
    soup. Courtesy of a loyal<br>
    establishment. Jolan True.</p>
  <p> She leaves. Picard looks around. It is unnerving to<br>
    be in the midst of the Romulan city, surrounded by<br>
    enemies. Data, of course, has no such apprehensions,<br>
    and continues to eat his soup. As Picard works on the<br>
    distasteful broth, he looks up to see --</p>
  <p>37B THE FOOTSOLDIERS</p>
  <p> who have been looking at them, but quickly look away.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT FIVE 51B.</p>
  <p>37C PICARD AND DATA</p>
  <p> Picard begins eating again, and tries to keep from<br>
    looking at the soldiers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We can't stay here long.</p>
  <p> Data glances up and reacts --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We may not have to... Direct your<br>
    view to the far corner... is that<br>
    not Pardek?</p>
  <p>38<br>

  <p>44 CLOSE ON PARDEK</p>
  <p> who has just entered the area, and moving to talk with<br>
    two other Romulan civilians.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>45 ANGLE - PICARD AND DATA</p>
  <p> having seen him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I believe you're right...</p>
  <p> Picard pauses in his soup eating to watch Pardek...</p>
  <p> Data glances over to see...</p>
  <p>45A OMITTED</p>
  <p>45B THE FOOTSOLDIERS</p>
  <p> staring right at them.</p>
  <p>45C PICARD AND DATA</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    Perhaps you should appear to<br>
    enjoy your soup.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts, begins to eat again...</p>
  <p>45D THE ROMULAN FOOTSOLDIERS</p>
  <p> have moved into the cafe, and stand chatting casually.</p>
  <p>45E PICARD AND DATA</p>
  <p> continue to watch Pardek.</p>
  <p>46 PARDEK</p>
  <p> bids farewell to his colleagues and starts down the<br>
    street.</p>
  <p>47 PICARD AND DATA</p>
  <p> casually put down their bowls of soup and turn to move<br>
    after Pardek. But --</p>

  <p>56 THE SOLDIERS</p>
  <p> block their way, disruptors drawn.</p>
  <p> ROMULAN#1<br>
    Do not move.</p>
  <p> Picard and Data stop, eyeing the weapons.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What? You've made a mistake...</p>
  <p> ROMULAN#1<br>
    Quiet. Come with us...</p>
  <p> The soldiers grab their quarry in a firm grip and,<br>
    holding the disruptors at their backs, move them up<br>
    the street and around the corner.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>57 INT. ROMULAN CAVES - A LITTLE LATER</p>
  <p> The two soldiers push Picard and Data along ahead of<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> ROMULAN#1<br>
    Wait here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    For what? Why have you brought<br>
    us here?</p>
  <p> A movement from the cavern entrance; all turn toward<br>
    it... and in walks Pardek.</p>
  <p> PARDEK<br>
    Welcome to Romulus, Captain<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> He gestures toward the &quot;Romulan soldiers&quot; who have<br>
    begun stripping off their uniforms -- revealing<br>
    civilian clothing underneath.</p>
  <p> PARDEK<br>
    Don't let our &quot;soldiers&quot; alarm<br>
    you... we had to get you off the<br>
    streets quickly. Romulan security<br>
    knows you are here.</p>
  <p> Picard casts a glance around the room. He's not<br>
    certain who these people are... whether he can trust<br>
    them...</p>
  <p> PARDEK<br>
    (reassuring)<br>
    I am Pardek... you are among<br>
    friends, Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard knows he must take a chance.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have come on an urgent mission<br>
    from the Federation. I am looking<br>
    for Ambassador Spock.</p>
  <p> VOICE (o.c.)<br>
    Indeed...</p>
  <p> All heads turn toward the sound. It comes from deep<br>
    shadows within the cave.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>57 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The group is silent... then, the sound of footsteps<br>
    echoes on the cave floor... from a long way... moving<br>
    ever closer, the plock-plock ringing loud in the<br>
    silence of the cave, the echoes swelling as the<br>
    footsteps approach... now we see --</p>
  <p>58 OMITTED</p>
  <p>59 A SHADOWY FIGURE</p>
  <p> beginning to emerge. He moves closer, closer... his<br>
    bearing regal, poised...</p>
  <p> But his face is still in darkness... finally he steps<br>
    out into the light... and we see the unmistakable<br>
    visage of SPOCK.</p>
  <p> When he speaks, there is no warmth to his voice, and<br>
    his eyes are cold. He is not happy to see Picard.</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    You have found him, Captain<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> And on the various reactions --</p>
  <p> SUPERIMPOSE:</p>
