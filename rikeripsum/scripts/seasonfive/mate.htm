    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> leaving orbit around the planet Krios.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45761.3.<br>
    In an effort to bring an end to<br>
    their centuries-long war, Krios<br>
    and Valt Minor have agreed to<br>
    a Ceremony of Reconciliation, to<br>
    be held aboard the Enterprise at<br>
    a point mid-way between their<br>
    two systems.</p>
  <p>2 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> PICARD and the Kriosian Ambassador, BRIAM. Briam is<br>
    tall, almost frail-looking, and his people have dark skin<br>
    and hair, much in the manner of those from Earth's<br>
    Indian subcontinent. Picard hands him a cup of tea.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I apologize for the delay in our<br>
    arrival; we had to stop at Harod<br>
    Four and pick up a group of<br>
    stranded miners.</p>
  <p> BRIAM<br>
    Please, Captain. We are grateful<br>
    that the Federation has taken as<br>
    much interest as it has in this<br>
    matter.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Was Mister La Forge able to<br>
    provide the special cargo handling<br>
    provisions you requested?</p>
  <p> BRIAM<br>
    Indeed he was. However... until<br>
    we reach our rendezvous with the<br>
    Valtese, may I ask that the cargo<br>
    bay be declared off-limits to all<br>
    but the most essential personnel?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Perfect Mate&quot; - REV. 2/21/92 - TEASER 2-2A. </p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I trust, Ambassador, that this<br>
    cargo is not in any way dangerous?</p>
  <p> BRIAM<br>
    Nothing of the sort. It is a<br>
    gift... for Alrik, the Valtese<br>
    leader. I am cautious only<br>
    because it is quite fragile...<br>
    and quite irreplaceable.</p>
  <p> RIKER's COM VOICE<br>
    Bridge to Captain Picard...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go ahead.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We've picked up a distress call<br>
    from a Ferengi shuttle...</p>
  <p> Picard frowns.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (rises)<br>
    Set a course to intercept...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir...</p>
  <p>4 INT. CAPT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> As they rise to EXIT...</p>
  <p> BRIAM<br>
    Captain, the timing of our<br>
    ceremony with Alrik is critical.<br>
    It cannot be delayed...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll be at the rendezvous on<br>
    schedule, don't worry.</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Perfect Mate&quot; - REV. 2/11/92 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>6 INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard has joined RIKER, WORF and DATA on the bridge.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Ferengi report their<br>
    containment field is collapsing...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are within visual range.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p> The image on the VIEWSCREEN is magnified and the<br>
    shuttle is revealed... a trail of some emissions can<br>
    be seen, the ship seems to be drifting...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Their reactor core is unstable,<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How many on board?</p>

  <p>9 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Worf, escort our Ferengi<br>
    guests to quarters...<br>
    (afterthought)<br>
    ... not too close to mine.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Understood.</p>
  <p> He EXITS...</p>
  <p>10 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> As Worf comes around a corner leading the Ferengi...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Unless you can arrange for your<br>
    own transport, you will have to<br>
    remain on the Enterprise until<br>
    we have completed our mission...</p>
  <p> QOL<br>
    That will not be a problem.</p>
  <p> PAR LENOR<br>
    We are in no hurry.</p>
  <p> QOL<br>
    We look forward to enjoying the<br>
    comforts of your fine ship.</p>
  <p> Worf leads them to a door which opens into...</p>
  <p>11 INT. FERENGI QUARTERS</p>
  <p> As they ENTER...</p>
  <p> QOL<br>
    Quite acceptable. Not what we're<br>
    used to, you understand... but<br>
    it will do.</p>
  <p> PAR LENOR<br>
    Perhaps your captain would care<br>
    to invite us to join him for<br>
    dinner this evening...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The captain dines alone.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Perfect Mate&quot; - 2/10/92 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> QOL<br>
    A pity.</p>
  <p> Worf grunts an acknowledgement and leaves. As the<br>
    doors close, the Ferengi exchange a glance and laugh.</p>
  <p> QOL<br>
    That was too easy!</p>
  <p> And on their laughter...</p>

  <p> Picard, Geordi and Briam arrive outside the holodeck...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We've been working from your<br>
    drawings, Ambassador... I hope<br>
    we're in the ballpark...</p>
  <p> BRIAM<br>

  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Enter when ready.</p>
  <p> The door opens to reveal the interior of an opulent,<br>
    golden ceremonial temple... Briam gasps an<br>
    appreciation...</p>
  <p> BRIAM<br>
    Astonishing. It is the ancient<br>
    Temple of Akadar.</p>
  <p> As they ENTER, the door closes and pan down the<br>
    corridor to find the two Ferengi peeking around the<br>
    corner... seeing that the ambassador has disappeared<br>
    into the holodeck... Par Lenor nods to Qol to get<br>
    going... Qol moves away down the perpendicular corridor<br>
    as Par Lenor stays...</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Perfect Mate&quot; - REV. 2/20/92 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>14 INT. HOLODECK - TEMPLE</p>
  <p> Still in awe, Briam inspects the setting...</p>
  <p> BRIAM<br>
    It is this temple that bonds Krios<br>
    and Valt, gentlemen... two<br>
    brothers once ruled a vast empire<br>
    from this site... until they were<br>
    torn apart by their love for an<br>
    extraordinary woman. This is<br>
    where the wars began. And this<br>
    is where they shall end.</p>
  <p>15 INT. CARGO BAY</p>
  <p> as Qol slips inside. The room is dimly lit, he looks<br>
    around to make sure he is alone. His eyes widen as<br>
    he gets his first look at the &quot;gift&quot; he has come to<br>
    steal.</p>
  <p>16 REVERSE ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Suspended several feet off the ground in a zero-gravity<br>
    field is a pod about the same size as an Egyptian style<br>
    sarcophagus; its decorations, though alien-looking, are<br>
    every bit as elaborate. The gravity field casts a<br>
    shimmering light on it, giving this floating jewel an<br>
    almost magical look.</p>
  <p>17 QOL</p>
  <p> reacts, excited...</p>
  <p>18 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> As the door opens and Picard, Briam and Geordi emerge<br>
    from the holodeck...</p>
  <p> BRIAM<br>
    There are details of course to<br>
    be added...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge is entirely at<br>
    your disposal, Ambassador...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Just let me know what you need...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Perfect Mate&quot; - 2/10/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BRIAM<br>
    Yes, of course... I must consult<br>
    several of the historical volumes<br>
    that I brought with me...<br>
    perhaps we can reconvene later<br>
    this...</p>
  <p> Par Lenor suddenly appears in front of them... delaying<br>
    the Ambassador's exit...</p>
  <p> PAR LENOR<br>
    Excuse me... excuse me... is it<br>
    true? Is a Kriosian ambassador<br>
    aboard this vessel?</p>
  <p> BRIAM<br>
    Yes. Can I help you?</p>
  <p> Picard steps in, trying to help the ambassador avoid<br>
    the headaches he knows a Ferengi invariably brings...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The ambassador is very busy...</p>
  <p> PAR LENOR<br>
    Ah, do you schedule his<br>
    appointments?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am the captain of this ship.</p>
  <p> Picard moves the Ambassador down the corridor... the<br>
    Ferengi follows...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What is it you want?</p>
  <p> PAR LENOR<br>
    Allow me to present myself. Par<br>
    Lenor of the Ferengi Trade<br>
    Mission. We are pleased to hear<br>
    that you have at last negotiated<br>
    peace with the Valtese,<br>
    Ambassador. Peace is good for<br>
    trade... unless you happen to be<br>
    an arms merchant!</p>
  <p> Par Lenor bursts into an exaggerated laugh.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Perfect Mate&quot; - REV. 2/10/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>19 INT. CARGO BAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Qol stacks crates and canisters and climbs up to get<br>
    a better look at the sarcophagus...</p>
  <p>19A INT. CARGO BAY - ANGLE ON FERENGI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> looking across sarcophagus.</p>
  <p>20 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> At the turbolift, Picard waits impatiently for the lift<br>
    to arrive... shoots Geordi a look as the Ferengi<br>
    continues to drill the Ambassador...</p>
  <p> PAR LENOR<br>
    ... in return for the exclusive<br>
    rights to transport all Kriosian<br>
    products to the Valt system...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    May I suggest that you arrange<br>
    to meet at another time, after<br>
    the ceremony?</p>
  <p> The turbolift doors finally open... as Picard ushers<br>
    in Briam...</p>
  <p> BRIAM<br>
    Perhaps that would be best.</p>
  <p> PAR LENOR<br>
    But...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (takes his arm)<br>
    Listen... have you been down to<br>
    see the dolphins yet? You really<br>
    shouldn't miss them...</p>
  <p> Picard gives Geordi a grateful look as he says...</p>

  <p> The door closes in the Ferengi's face.</p>
  <p>21 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Picard hits his combadge.</p>

    Picard to Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF (V.O.)<br>
    Worf, here.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Perfect Mate&quot; - 2/10/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    One of the Ferengi just waylaid<br>
    Ambassador Briam. Keep a short<br>

  <p>22 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> WORF at tactical.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I don't want them disrupting this<br>
    conference.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf begins calibrating the ship's internal sensors.<br>
    Reacts as he sees something...</p>

    One of the Ferengi.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts as Worf EXITS into the turbolift...</p>
  <p>23 INT. CARGO BAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As Worf leads in his security team... sees Qol up on<br>
    the makeshift ladder near the sarcophagus... taking<br>
    readings with a Ferengi tricorder...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You! What are you doing?</p>
  <p> The sudden intrusion startles Qol and as he turns to<br>
    their arrival, the support under him wobbles and falls<br>
    backwards, kicking the crates he's standing on into the<br>
    sarcophagus... the energy field crackles and shorts<br>
    out... and the sarcophagus falls and as it hits the<br>
    floor, it cracks open, causing bright shafts of light<br>
    to shoot out... and slowly the shell dissolves<br>
    (indicating that the casing is constructed from some<br>
    sort of &quot;solid&quot; energy).</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Perfect Mate&quot; - 2/10/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> QOL<br>
    This is a misunderstanding... I<br>
    was looking for the barbershop...<br>
    Apparently I made an incorrect<br>
    turn -- and...</p>
  <p>24 ANGLE</p>
  <p> he's interrupted by Picard, Riker and Briam's<br>
    arrival... Briam reacts with horror...</p>
  <p> BRIAM<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Worf, re: the<br>
    Ferengi)<br>
    Get him out of here. Confine both<br>
    of them to their quarters and put<br>
    a guard on the door.</p>
  <p> Worf acknowledges, EXITS with the Ferengi...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is happening?</p>
  <p> BRIAM<br>
    Emergence...</p>
  <p>25 ON POD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The outer shell is now completely gone, revealing a<br>
    cocoon-like structure underneath, as if a Human figure<br>
    were wrapped in some sort of organic matter. This, too,<br>
    begins to dissolve away. The figure underneath the<br>
    organic casing is now becoming visible.</p>
  <p>26 ON PICARD AND THE OTHERS</p>
  <p> They can only stare in amazement.</p>
  <p>27 ON THE FIGURE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> now revealed to be the most exotic and beautiful woman<br>
    we have ever seen. Her green eyes are set off by her<br>
    dark skin and hair; she wears a long, diaphanous gown.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Perfect Mate&quot; - 2/10/92 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>28 SCENE</p>
  <p> She looks around the room, and though her features seem<br>
    to indicate that she was expecting to emerge into an<br>
    entirely different setting (the reconciliation<br>
    ceremony), she never loses her serene, almost regal<br>
    composure.</p>
  <p> Picard steps forward, and she focuses her attention<br>
    on him.</p>
  <p> She gives him a smile so radiant that he is momentarily<br>
    struck mute. She approaches him, her eyes locked on<br>
    his.</p>

    No, Kamala... this is not Alrik.<br>
    This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard<br>
    of the Federation Starship<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Kamala takes a curious beat to study Picard and then<br>
    laughs charmingly, embarrassed... (NOTE: with Picard,<br>
    she is articulate, direct, thoughtful, wry, Marietta<br>
    Tree.)</p>
  <p> KAMALA<br>
    (with humor)<br>
    That explains why you don't look<br>
    at all like your holographs. I<br>
    apologize, Captain. As an empath,<br>
    I could sense your authority.<br>
    I assumed that you were<br>
    Chancellor Alrik...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm afraid I require an<br>
    explanation...</p>
  <p> KAMALA<br>
    As do I, Ambassador. Why have<br>
    I been brought out of stasis<br>
    prematurely?</p>
  <p> BRIAM<br>
    (to Kamala)<br>
    There was an accident...<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Captain, this is quite<br>
    complicated, perhaps we should...</p>
  <p> As she senses that Picard wants straight answers...</p>
  <p> KAMALA<br>
    It is not complicated at all,<br>
    Briam. And the Captain has no<br>
    tolerance for prevarication.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I am a gift to Alrik of Valt.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts... Briam knows that he has a diplomatic<br>
    problem on his hands...</p>

    You've been using this ship to<br>
    transport a sentient being as<br>
    property?</p>
  <p> During the following, Kamala looks Riker up and down...<br>
    measuring him, curious about him, almost as though she<br>
    is undressing him in her mind... he feels uncomfortable<br>
    with it... a sexual tension is present...</p>
  <p> BRIAM<br>
    Not as property... as a gift...<br>
    I was concerned that you would<br>
    not entirely understand...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your concern was justified,<br>
    Ambassador...</p>
  <p> Kamala turns back to Picard...</p>
  <p> KAMALA<br>
    You're angry. Why?</p>
  <p> And during the following, she does the same thing to<br>
    Picard as she did to Riker. Again there is a sexual<br>
    tension. Picard absolutely ignores it... which only<br>
    interests her more...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There is a provision within the<br>
    Federation Constitution that<br>
    protects an individual's<br>
    fundamental rights... once you<br>
    were brought aboard this<br>
    starship...</p>
  <p> KAMALA<br>
    (realizing, charmed)<br>
    You are coming to my rescue! What<br>
    a kind and generous purpose. But<br>
    Captain, I do not need to be<br>
    rescued...</p>

    In our history there was a woman<br>

    the brothers Krios and Valt with<br>
    such passion that an empire<br>
    fell...</p>

    The wars began when Krios<br>
    kidnapped Garuth and took her to<br>
    our planet...</p>
  <p> KAMALA<br>
    Like her, I am an empathic<br>
    metamorph. The first female<br>
    metamorph born on my world for<br>
    over a hundred years.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A &quot;metamorph&quot;?</p>
  <p> KAMALA<br>
    A mutant. A biological curiosity,<br>
    if you will. With the ability<br>
    to sense what a potential mate<br>
    wants... what he needs... what<br>
    gives him the greatest pleasure...<br>
    and then to become that for him.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why were you in stasis?</p>
  <p> KAMALA<br>
    Metamorphs have a long and complex<br>
    sexual maturing process. I am<br>
    in the Finiis'ral, the third and<br>
    final stage. It can be an<br>
    uncomfortable transition... Not<br>
    only for me, but for the men<br>
    around me...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    In what way?</p>
  <p> KAMALA<br>
    My body is producing an unusually<br>
    elevated level of what you would<br>
    call pheromones. The effect can<br>
    be quite... provocative. Perhaps<br>
    you sense it...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (resisting)<br>
    Ah, unfortunately, I'm not an<br>

    talking about...</p>
  <p> KAMALA<br>
    You were curious, weren't you?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Curious isn't exactly the way I'd<br>

    On the contrary, I had servants<br>
    and tutors at my side<br>
    constantly... you once wanted<br>
    to know what I am like when I<br>
    am alone... I have never been.<br>
    There was always someone there...<br>
    to educate me in literature,<br>
    history, art, sex...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I have been alone on this<br>
    journey and I've found myself<br>
    thinking about all the curious<br>
    questions you asked... you<br>
    wanted to know who I am. The<br>
    only answer that comes to me is,<br>
    &quot;I am for you, Alrik of Valt&quot;.<br>
    Because that is the truth.<br>
    (beat, melancholy)<br>
    In a day, I will bond with a man<br>
    I've never met... and I will turn<br>
    myself into what he wants me to<br>
    be... for the rest of my life.</p>
  <p> Picard is caught in a bind between political duties,<br>
    Prime Directive and personal feelings for this woman.<br>
    He cannot find it in himself to take an advocate's<br>
    role. The best he can do is...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I also once asked you if you were<br>
    doing this of your own accord...</p>
  <p> KAMALA<br>
    I am honored to be chosen to serve<br>
    my people as an emissary of<br>
    peace...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I find it ironic on the eve<br>
    of this ceremony... which I have<br>
    spent my entire life preparing<br>
    for... that I should meet a man<br>
    like you...</p>
  <p> Off his look... And suddenly her cheeks flush... and<br>
    she turns away... He searches for the right thing to<br>
    say.</p>

  <p> Close on the back of ALRIK, the man who will wed this<br>
    extraordinary woman... we hear the sound of the door<br>
    opening as Picard ENTERS (o.c.)... and he turns and<br>
    already we don't like him on first sight... he is drab,<br>
    a dull, dull man... he's colorless and stern... and<br>
    far shorter than Kamala... he is about Picard's age.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    He hasn't regained consciousness<br>

    A tragedy. Your willingness to<br>
    assist is appreciated by both<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will do my best... although I<br>
    have found some of the rituals<br>

    about the remaining provisions<br>
    in the treaty... the proposed<br>
    trade agreements are not<br>
    acceptable... We still must review<br>
    the uncommitted territories...<br>
    as well as discuss the schedule<br>
    for exchange of technology...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Kriosians have authorized me<br>

    Such a sentimental people, these<br>
    Kriosians... it is hard to believe<br>
    we have a common ancestry...<br>
    (sighs)<br>
    I suppose they've sent the<br>
    metamorph.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Kamala? Yes. She is looking<br>
    forward to meeting you.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> KAMALA<br>
    What did you tell him?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That you were looking forward to<br>

  <p> KAMALA<br>
    When am I to be presented?</p>

    It will be the first order of<br>

  <p> KAMALA<br>
    Would you like some tea?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I should prepare for the ceremony.</p>
  <p> KAMALA<br>
    Let me help you with<br>
    pronuniciations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think I can muddle my way<br>

    Please. Don't leave.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>

    Talk to me. I love the sound of<br>
    your voice. I'll turn out the<br>

    I don't want to be alone.</p>

  <p> She smiles, acknowledging.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Now that I know you're listening<br>

    think of a word to say...</p>
  <p> KAMALA<br>
    A starship captain must encounter<br>
    all sorts of lifeforms... am I<br>
    one of the most unique you've ever<br>
    met? Please say yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> KAMALA<br>
    What a nice thing to say.</p>
  <p> She tentatively reaches out and gently runs the palm of<br>
    her hand from his brow across his scalp and it is one<br>
    of the most sensual strokes in the history of man...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (softly)<br>
    Kamala, have I not done everything<br>
    possible to discourage this?</p>
  <p> KAMALA<br>
    Maybe that's the perfect way to<br>
    attract a metamorph.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't wish to use you as other<br>
    men have.</p>
  <p> KAMALA<br>
    But you are not other men. You<br>
    could never use me. That is the<br>
    very reason why I am with you<br>
    tonight.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I really ought to go. You do have<br>
    an early appointment in the<br>

  <p>52 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Beverly and Picard again sharing morning tea. A<br>
    parallel scene to the one in Act Two. Picard is lost<br>
    in his own thoughts.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Quiet this morning.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sorry.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Penny?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    For your thoughts. Penny for your<br>
    thoughts.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    You have one?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The replicator ought to have one<br>
    on file.</p>
  <p> Picard would rather get himself lost in light banter<br>
    but it just isn't possible.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you mind if I take off the<br>
    uniform for a moment?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Captain... !</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> And Beverly studies him seriously.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> He stands.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Besides... it's all your fault.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Mine?</p>

    You insisted I look into her<br>
    situation...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The metamorph?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (sighs)<br>
    The metamorph. Kamala. We have<br>
    spent a lot of time together the<br>
    last few days... you were right<br>
    about several things, Beverly...<br>
    her entire life has been<br>
    orchestrated for this moment...<br>
    but she intends to see it<br>
    through... to help her people end<br>
    this war...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (beat, perplexed by his<br>
    intensity)<br>
    Are you saying there's nothing<br>
    else that can be done... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's not that simple.</p>
  <p> And he looks at Beverly and in a beat, she understands<br>
    and he understands she understands... he almost smiles,<br>
    embarrassed...</p>

  <p> She studies him, sorry she ever sent him down there<br>
    in the first place --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I barely even know who she is<br>
    because who she is changes the<br>
    moment the next man walks in the<br>
    room.<br>
    (beat, softens)<br>
    But suddenly, I find myself<br>
    hoping... the next man doesn't<br>
    walk in.</p>
  <p> A long beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But he will, of course. In a few<br>
    hours, the ceremony will begin...<br>
    she will mate with a man who cares<br>
    far more about trade agreements<br>
    than about her. And I think of<br>
    how she will be with him... how<br>
    she will change to accomodate<br>
    him... and...<br>
    (beat, understatement)<br>
    ... I don't like it.</p>
  <p> She rises and surprises him with a hug. Picard is<br>
    uncomfortable having revealed his feelings...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry to be bothering you with<br>
    this...</p>

  <p> Kamala in front of a huge mirror... dressed in the most<br>
    incredible gown a woman has ever worn... she is a<br>

    this vision in... he will never forget how she looks<br>
    at this moment.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    You've not even met him.</p>
  <p> KAMALA<br>
    It no longer matters.<br>
    (off Picard's reaction)<br>
    I wish I could convey to you what<br>
    it's like to be a metamorph...<br>
    to feel the inner strength of<br>
    someone... to realize that being<br>
    with him is opening your mind and<br>
    heart to endless new<br>
    possibilities... to hear yourself<br>
    say: I like myself when I am with<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Kamala...</p>
  <p> KAMALA<br>
    For a metamorph, there is no<br>
    greater pleasure... and no greater<br>
    wish than to bond with that kind<br>
    of mate at the end of the<br>
    Finiis'ral...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    ... as I have bonded with you.</p>

    easily... and yet I would be lying<br>
    if I were to claim, that even at<br>

    words but his eyes leave the book and he leans back...<br>
    thinking and as the book closes in his hands...</p>
