  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Traveling through space parallel but not too close<br>
    to a huge stellar core fragment, hundreds of times<br>
    larger than the Enterprise... It is quite spherical,<br>
    not too nubly (unlike an asteroid) emitting a<br>
    bluish-white light glow, with cascades of sparklies,<br>
    occasional blue-violet gamma ray bursts...</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45470.1.<br>
    The Enterprise has been diverted<br>
    to the Moab sector to track a<br>
    stellar core fragment of a<br>
    disintegrated neutron star. Our<br>
    science teams have been asked to<br>
    monitor the planetary disruptions<br>
    it may cause.</p>
  <p>2 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> RIKER leaning over DATA at ops, reacting with concern<br>
    to something. WORF, TROI, and GEORDI are also at their<br>
    stations. Picard ENTERS from the ready room.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    We've got a problem... our core<br>
    fragment is going to pass by Moab<br>
    Four in six days...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masterpiece Society&quot; - 11/5/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Isn't that what we anticipated?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We didn't anticipate that somebody<br>
    would be living there.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    An artificial environment has been<br>
    constructed on the southern<br>
    continent, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Have you definitely established<br>
    someone's inside it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Captain. Sensors are reading<br>
    Human lifeforms.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    Human.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Has there been a response to our<br>
    hails, Mister Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Negative, Commander.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any starships ever reported<br>
    missing in this sector, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Nossir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How the hell did they get<br>
    themselves on a deserted planet?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm pretty sure they know we're<br>
    here...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masterpiece... &quot; - REV. 11/6/91 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm picking up deep E-M<br>
    readings... looks like wave<br>
    emissions from an obsolete<br>
    subspace relay...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Which would suggest they also have<br>
    the ability to communicate with<br>
    us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, open the lower band<br>
    frequencies that were most<br>
    commonly used in the last<br>
    century...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Channel open.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard<br>
    of the Federation Starship<br>
    Enterprise. It is urgent that<br>
    you respond.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, defensive shields around the<br>
    structure are increasing strength.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not exactly a welcome mat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We mean you no harm. We must warn<br>
    you that your planet is about to<br>
    experience massive seismic<br>
    disruptions due to an approaching<br>
    stellar core fragment. No<br>
    structure will be able to withstand<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> A beat... silence... and then --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They are responding.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masterpiece... &quot; REV. 11/6/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 ANGLE - VIEWSCREEN OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> On the viewscreen appears a human male, AARON CONOR, in<br>
    his late 30's or early 40's. He wears power and<br>
    authority easily for one relatively young and boyish<br>
    looking. At the moment, he is obviously troubled.</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    Enterprise... I am Aaron Conor...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Conor, we were unaware of<br>
    any Human colony in this system.</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    Captain, I don't want to be rude<br>
    but we don't wish to interact with<br>
    outsiders. I have only responded<br>
    because of your warning.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The fragment will begin to have<br>
    serious effects on your planet<br>
    in six days.</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    Yes, I know. We have been<br>
    tracking it. But our biosphere<br>
    has been constructed to withstand<br>
    quakes of eight-point-seven on<br>
    the Richter Scale.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Data... ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to viewscreen)<br>
    The fragment has a density of one<br>
    hundred billion kilograms per cubic<br>
    centimeter. As a result, when it<br>
    passes Moab Four, it will cause<br>
    tectonic shifts well beyond<br>
    eight-point-seven on the Richter<br>
    Scale.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm afraid we're going to have<br>
    to evacuate your people.</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    Evacuate? That's not possible.<br>
    There must be an alternative...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The alternative, sir, is dying...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masterpiece Society&quot; - 11/5/91 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Conor, if you wish, we will<br>
    find you another isolated planet<br>
    that is safe.</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    No, we must remain here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe we haven't made ourselves<br>
    clear...</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    Of course, you have, Commander...<br>
    and I hope I've made myself clear<br>
    that we must seek an alternative<br>
    solution...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (with diplomacy)<br>
    We will gladly explore the<br>
    possibility with you, Mister<br>
    Conor... would you care to come<br>
    aboard to discuss it?</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    Our environment is sealed. No<br>
    one can get in or out.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are capable of matter/energy<br>
    transport...</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    Matter/energy?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We can take you directly through<br>
    the structure.</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    Really. That's quite remarkable.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (genial, inviting)<br>
    May we arrange for your transport?</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    No. I must stay here.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masterpiece... &quot; - REV. 11/6/91 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard exchanges a glance with Riker, beginning to get<br>
    impatient with this fellow.</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But under the circumstances, I<br>
    will permit a small delegation<br>
    from your ship inside the<br>
    biosphere...<br>
    (with humor)<br>
    ... if only to see this<br>
    matter/energy transportation you<br>
    speak of...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very good. Commander Riker and<br>
    an away team will join you<br>
    shortly. Picard out.</p>
  <p>4 THE VIEWSCREEN</p>
  <p> returns to the planet. Picard is thoughtful...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Limit the away team to three<br>
    people, Will...</p>
  <p> Riker acknowledges and as he turns...</p>
  <p>5 RESUME BRIDGE</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Geordi -- I want to overwhelm him<br>
    with evidence...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Understood.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Counselor, I'd like you with us<br>
    on this one...</p>
  <p> She nods and as they move toward the turbolift...</p>
  <p>6 EXT. GENOME COURTYARD - DAY - LATER</p>
  <p> A limited view of a yard... MARCUS BENBECK, a thin,<br>
    studious man in his 50's is arguing with Conor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masterpiece Society&quot; - 11/5/91 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Both men are excellent physical specimens, dressed in<br>
    comfortable civilian clothes -- closer to 20th-century<br>
    garb than we are used to seeing.</p>
  <p> BENBECK<br>
    This is a mistake.</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    Good Lord, Martin, what would you<br>
    have me do?</p>
  <p> BENBECK<br>
    Anything that would keep them out<br>
    of here.</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    We have nothing to hide.</p>
  <p> BENBECK<br>
    We have a great deal to lose.</p>
  <p> They react first to the sound of the transport...</p>
  <p> BENBECK<br>
    What is that... ?</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    (reacting)<br>
    It's them... Look at this,<br>
    Martin...</p>
  <p> They watch --</p>
  <p>7 THE AWAY TEAM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> MATERIALIZE.</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    Incredible.</p>
  <p> Riker, Geordi and Troi and look around... and begin<br>
    to have an inkling why these people are reluctant to<br>
    leave... MOVE TO REVEAL the Genome Colony... lush,<br>
    spacious, peaceful. The courtyard is the main<br>
    gathering place and there are dozens of people watching<br>
    with amazement at the away team's arrival... they are<br>
    all very attractive, perfect physical specimens.<br>
    Exotic vegetation and pleasant seating areas make it<br>
    an inviting, comfortable area.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masterpiece Society&quot; - 11/5/91 - TEASER 8.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Walls with see-through panels separate this paradise<br>
    from the red, barren, noxious landscape beyond -- an<br>
    ever-present indication that this courtyard is merely<br>
    an oasis from the toxic atmosphere outside.</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    Hello.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Forgive me... I'm not sure how<br>
    to welcome you. You are the first<br>
    visitors we've ever had...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masterpiece ... &quot; - REV. 11/6/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>8 EXT. GENOME COURTYARD - MINUTES LATER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The group walks along the courtyard. Conor is cordial,<br>
    outgoing. Benbeck is a stern, colorless man.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's lovely... I can understand<br>
    why you are reluctant to leave,<br>
    Mister Conor...</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    We are not just &quot;reluctant&quot;, Ms.<br>
    Troi. It is imperative that we<br>
    remain.</p>
  <p> BENBECK<br>
    (harsh)<br>
    It would be suicide to evacuate.<br>
    It would destroy everything we've<br>
    worked for two centuries to<br>
    accomplish...</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    You see, this is an engineered<br>
    society...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Engineered... ?</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    Genetically engineered...</p>
  <p> He pauses, trying to find a way to explain this<br>
    simply...</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    Our ancestors came from Earth to<br>
    develop the perfect society. They<br>
    believed that through controlled<br>
    procreation, they could create<br>
    people without flaws... and those<br>
    people would build a paradise.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masterpiece Society&quot; - 11/5/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    All of you... have been<br>
    selectively bred? Your DNA<br>
    patterns chosen?</p>
  <p> Conor turns and smiles at her.</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    Eight generations of us.</p>
  <p> BENBECK<br>
    We have immeasurably extended the<br>
    potential of humanity --<br>
    physically, psychologically --<br>
    we have evolved beyond...<br>
    beyond...<br>
    (realizing he's in<br>
    trouble)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Beyond us...</p>
  <p> BENBECK<br>
    Frankly, yes. No one in this<br>
    society would be blind, for<br>
    example, no offense intended...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I can see you just fine, sir.</p>
  <p> BENBECK<br>
    Yes, well, my point was just...</p>
  <p> Conor is embarrassed, looks at Benbeck with a critical<br>
    eye, but with disarming humor...</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    Thank you, Martin... Perhaps<br>
    you've also made it clear that<br>
    we still have a few imperfections<br>
    we're working on...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    For the most part, we have<br>
    achieved a fully integrated<br>
    existence... not just among<br>
    ourselves but with our<br>
    environment... we don't just live<br>
    here... we are part of the<br>
    environment... it is part of us.<br>
    Every plant life, every<br>
    microscopic lifeform... is part<br>
    of a master design.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masterpiece Society&quot; - 11/5/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> CONOR (cont'd)<br>
    We cannot separate ourselves from<br>
    it without irreparably altering<br>
    who and what we are.</p>
  <p> BENBECK<br>
    Your presence here has already<br>
    begun to affect the entire<br>
    balance of our society...</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    (firm)<br>
    If we do not survive, the balance<br>
    of our society won't mean a great<br>
    deal... will it?</p>
  <p> Martin harrumphs and walks away... Conor leads the<br>
    group slowly into the courtyard, moving with them --</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    I apologize. But he is performing<br>
    his function as he is designed<br>
    to do.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (a poor opinion)<br>
    What &quot;function&quot; would that be?</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    He is the interpreter of our<br>
    founders' intentions for this<br>
    society.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A judge.</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    Yes, more or less. Obviously,<br>
    he has no diplomatic talents.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And obviously you do.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masterpiece ... &quot; - REV. 11/8/91 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I have been bred to fill this<br>
    specific role... we grow up<br>
    knowing exactly what our society<br>
    needs from us... what we are<br>
    expected to do.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Kind of takes some of fun out of<br>
    choosing, doesn't it?</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    Not at all. My entire<br>
    psychological makeup tells me that<br>
    I was born to lead... I am exactly<br>
    what I would choose to be.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Think of it another way -- are<br>
    there still people in your society<br>
    who have not discovered who they<br>
    really are or what they're meant<br>
    to do with their lives... ? They<br>
    may be in the wrong job... they<br>
    may be writing bad poetry. Even<br>
    worse, there may be great poets<br>
    working as laborers, never to be<br>
    discovered. That does not happen<br>
    here.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It is, for us, an ideal existence<br>
    and we won't give it up easily.</p>
  <p> He is passionate, and eloquent as a leader should be.<br>
    And Troi is impressed with him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We will do whatever we can to help<br>
    you preserve it.</p>
  <p> Their eyes meet... his smile thanks her... And as the<br>

    Martin was saying...</p>

    Too late. the damage is done.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Seriously.</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    Sometimes, I think the strict<br>

    that we're still Human. We'll<br>
    adjust, accommodate...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There must be other unexpected<br>
    events you have to deal with --<br>
    an untimely death, an accident...</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    Our geneticists are able to screen<br>
    out any congenital health risks<br>
    before conception... and the<br>
    population is diverse enough<br>
    to maintain a genetic balance<br>
    in the event of accidental death.<br>
    But very little that is unexpected<br>
    occurs here...<br>

    (laughs lightly)<br>
    I'll tell you the truth... and<br>
    I'll deny it if you tell Martin...<br>
    but today has been exhilarating...<br>
    meeting you, meeting new people,<br>
    with new ideas...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I feel the same about being<br>
    here... I'm something of a<br>
    student of Human nature... I find<br>
    this all fascinating...</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    A student of Human nature?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm the ship's counselor.</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    Ah, I'm afraid there wouldn't<br>

  <p> TROI<br>

    I'd book my next vacation at your<br>

  <p> CONOR<br>
    Well, in that case, I'll have to<br>

  <p> HANNAH<br>
    Your ship... what kind of energy<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We have a matter/antimatter warp<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>

    We can move a small moon or an<br>
    asteroid, but a stellar core<br>

    A multiphase tractor beam?</p>
  <p> HANNAH<br>

    No.</p>
  <p> HANNAH<br>
    With my theories and their<br>

  <p> A long moment as Conor wrestles with this one...<br>
    then...</p>
  <p> CONOR<br>
    No one had ever come here... and<br>
    no one had ever left. Until<br>

  <p> BENBECK<br>
    We have no idea how molecular<br>

    sympathizes with a look... he knows that he's given<br>
    in another inch here... he wants to hold the line but<br>

    They have given their humanity<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    In order to move the core fragment<br>
    to a safe trajectory, we needed<br>
    our tractor beam to be able to<br>
    handle high power pulses...</p>
  <p> HANNAH<br>
    And, we needed a much more<br>
    efficient emitter to do that...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    About four times more efficient...</p>

    But we couldn't get anywhere near<br>
    that without overloading the<br>
    emitter arrays...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So we added a little VISOR<br>
    technology to the process and were<br>
    able to boost the effective<br>
    force... and at the same time,<br>
    lower the power conduit stress<br>
    levels...</p>
  <p> He turns on a much more powerful beam than we saw<br>
    before... it now includes a bright pulse that quickly<br>
    travels from the device to the target...</p>

    brilliant... how come we didn't<br>
    invent any of these things?</p>

    If even a handful leave, the<br>
    damage to this society will be<br>

  <p>52 INT. CAPT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard is at the window, looking out, musing. A<br>
    chime...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The colonists are all on board,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How many finally?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Twenty-three.</p>
  <p> Picard takes that in... frustrated, unhappy...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If we ever needed a reminder of<br>
    the importance of the Prime<br>
    Directive, we have it now...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They're Human. The Prime<br>
    Directive doesn't apply.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doesn't it? Our very presence<br>
    damaged, perhaps destroyed, a way<br>
    of life.<br>

    Whether or not we agree with that<br>
    way of life... whether or not<br>
    they are Human... is ultimately<br>
    irrelevant, Number One. We are<br>
    responsible.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We had to respond to the threat<br>
    from the core fragment... didn't<br>
    we?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. Of course we did. And I wish<br>
    I could see any other course we<br>
    could have taken.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I would submit, in the end,<br>
    we proved ourselves just as<br>
    dangerous to that colony as any<br>
    stellar fragment could ever be.</p>
  <p> Riker acknowledges and EXITS, and on Picard's look...</p>
