    &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. CLARA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> CLARA SUTTER, a seven-year-old girl, and TROI sit at a<br>
    table set for tea. The settings include a place for<br>
    Clara's imaginary friend, Isabella. Troi is chatting<br>
    with Clara...</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    I like to cook all kinds of stuff.<br>
    Like yogurt and raisin salad...<br>
    chocolate-chip pancakes... and<br>
    purple omelettes.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Purple omelettes?</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    You put grape juice in the eggs.<br>
    Isabella doesn't like it very much<br>
    -- she says it tastes funny.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I can see her point...</p>
  <p> Troi picks up a cup full of sugar cubes.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Sugar with your tea?</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Yes, please.</p>
  <p> Troi serves a sugar cube into Clara's tea. Then she<br>
    turns to address an empty chair where &quot;Isabella&quot; is<br>
    sitting. It becomes clear that Isabella is Clara's<br>
    invisible friend.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Isabella... would you like some<br>
    too?</p>
  <p> Clara leans toward Isabella's seat, and listens<br>
    carefully to words only she can hear. After a moment,<br>
    she turns to Troi.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; - REV. 2/25/92 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Yes. But she takes two cubes.</p>
  <p> Troi serves the sugar.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'll bet Isabella is very pretty.</p>
  <p> Clara is enthusiastic about Isabella.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    She's very, very pretty. She has<br>
    blonde hair and a blue dress with<br>
    white buttons. Her ears are<br>
    pierced. And she's tall.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Maybe you could draw me a picture.<br>
    I'd love to see what she looks<br>
    like.</p>
  <p> Clara frowns.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    You don't think she's real.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I think she's real for you, Clara.<br>
    And that's real enough for me.</p>
  <p> Clara seems happy with the response. Troi looks across<br>
    the room at Clara's father, DANIEL SUTTER -- who has<br>
    been watching the entire time. Her look says that the<br>
    session is over.</p>
  <p> SUTTER<br>
    (to Clara)<br>
    Honey, I think it's time for you<br>
    to go. You don't want to keep<br>
    Keiko waiting.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    I have to go plant the nasturtiums<br>
    now.<br>
    (matter of fact)<br>
    I'm Keiko's helper in the<br>
    arboretum today.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Is that so?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; - 2/24/92 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> SUTTER<br>
    (to Clara)<br>
    Go ahead, Sweetie. Be home for<br>
    dinner.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I hope to see you soon, Clara.<br>
    Maybe we can be friends.</p>
  <p> Clara likes the idea.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Okay.</p>
  <p> Clara stands, carefully pulls out the chair for<br>
    Isabella, and heads for the door. She stops at the<br>
    door, &quot;hearing&quot; something that Isabella is saying. She<br>
    listens... then turns to Troi.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Counselor Troi?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes?</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Isabella says she likes you.</p>
  <p> Troi looks to Isabella.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Thank you, Isabella.</p>
  <p> Clara smiles, then EXITS. Sutter takes a seat next to<br>
    Troi. He looks concerned about his daughter. Troi<br>
    tries to reassure him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I understand why you're<br>
    concerned... but you have nothing<br>
    to worry about. It's a normal,<br>
    healthy activity for children to<br>
    engage in imaginary play.</p>
  <p> Sutter is relieved.</p>
  <p> SUTTER<br>
    I'm just afraid she's not making<br>
    real friends. She spends all of<br>
    her time with &quot;Isabella&quot;...</p>
  <p> Troi considers.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; - 2/24/92 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You've been moving from starship<br>
    to starship since Clara was two<br>
    years old. Maybe Isabella<br>
    provides a constant companion for<br>
    Clara. She knows this is one<br>
    friend she won't have to leave<br>
    behind.</p>
  <p> Sutter nods.</p>
  <p> SUTTER<br>
    You're probably right.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Give Clara a chance. As she<br>
    learns to make friends on the<br>
    Enterprise, she'll probably move<br>
    away from her imaginary world.</p>
  <p> Sutter offers Troi a grateful smile...</p>
  <p>2 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> on the outskirts of a large NEBULA -- a glowing expanse<br>
    of swirling red clouds, with a bright point of light<br>
    deep in its center.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45852.1.<br>
    The Enterprise has arrived at<br>
    FGC-four-seven -- a nebula which<br>
    has formed around a neutron star.<br>
    We are eager to investigate this<br>
    unique formation.</p>
  <p>3 INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF, ENSIGN FELTON and VARIOUS<br>
    NDS at stations. GEORDI is at an aft science station.<br>
    Everyone watches the main viewscreen, which displays<br>
    the nebula -- a rare and special sight.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; - REV. 2/28/92 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off console)<br>
    We've got elevated quantities of<br>
    hydrogen... helium... trionium...<br>
    but nothing the shields can't<br>
    handle.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Shields up.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Take us in, Ensign. One-quarter<br>
    impulse.</p>
  <p> ENSIGN FELTON<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Ensign Felton works the controls...</p>
  <p>4 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it enters the nebula. Suddenly, from within a<br>
    nearby cloud -- a tiny POINT OF LIGHT appears. The<br>
    light FLARES briefly as it passes through the ship's<br>
    shield bubble... then it ENTERS through the hull of the<br>
    ship...</p>
  <p>5 OMITTED</p>
  <p>5A INT. CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As small section of the ceiling GLOWS briefly with<br>
    a red color, and a POINT OF LIGHT emerges into the<br>
    corridor (as seen in the nebula). The light pauses,<br>
    then zips around a corner and out of view. Clearly<br>
    a life-form is now on board...</p>
  <p>5B ANOTHER CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The POINT OF LIGHT comes into view -- right behind Data<br>
    and Geordi, who are walking briskly down the corridor,<br>
    on their way to engineering, talking TECH...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In order to complete the scheduled<br>
    observations, the lateral sensors<br>
    will require additional processing<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; - REV. 3/02/92 - TEASER 5A.</p>
  <p>5B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We could steal a couple of hours<br>
    while they're recalibrating the<br>
    thermal interferometery scanner.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Will a couple of hours be enough<br>
    time to complete the<br>
    high-resolution series on the<br>
    neutron star?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No problem. We'll just double<br>
    up the main sensor bandwidth.</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi continue walking -- the light flies off<br>
    down another corridor...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; - REV. 2/26/92 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>6 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY and NURSE OGAWA are working at a medical<br>
    station, mid-conversation. During this scene, out of<br>
    their view, a small section of the wall GLOWS with a<br>
    red color, and the point of LIGHT emerges into the<br>
    room. The light flits about, as if watching Beverly<br>
    and Ogawa from afar...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    After dinner, then what?</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    We went to the holodeck and took<br>
    a walk on the Champs Elysees...</p>
  <p> Beverly reacts to the console.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The neural scanner still seems<br>
    a bit off. Let's check the sensor<br>
    calibration...</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    I'll run a diagnostic...</p>
  <p> They work for a beat.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And... ?</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    And?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    After Paris... ?</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    He has shore leave next month.<br>
    He asked me to go to Risa with<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No problem. Nurse Davila can<br>
    cover for you.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    I don't know if I'm going, Doctor.<br>
    I hear it's a very uninhibited<br>
    atmosphere. Personally, I don't<br>
    think I'm ready for that kind of<br>
    &quot;fun.&quot;</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; - REV. 2/26/92 - TEASER 6A.</p>
  <p>6A CLOSE ON POINT OF LIGHT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it zips into a nearby hypospray, causing it to GLOW<br>
    for an instant. After a beat, the light exits the<br>
    hypospray and zips into a nearby tricorder, which<br>
    glows... and into another medical tool -- all in quick<br>
    succession. The light is exploring its environment.<br>
    Over which we HEAR --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (o.s.)<br>
    Try to talk him into Telana Minor<br>
    instead -- they've got a cruise<br>
    down the Jokri River... the<br>
    iridescent currents are beautiful.</p>
  <p> The light flies away and EXITS through the nearest<br>
    wall...</p>
  <p>7 OMITTED</p>
  <p>8 INT. ARBORETUM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Lush and beautiful (as seen in &quot;Data's Day&quot;.) A<br>
    section of the wall GLOWS red -- the POINT OF LIGHT<br>
    zips into a nearby gardening tool... then EXITS...</p>
  <p>9 OMITTED</p>
  <p>10 ON A FLOWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The light enters an exotic-looking flower, causing the<br>
    flower to GLOW -- but this glow is different, longer<br>
    and more intense. The glow vanishes and a duplicate<br>
    flower appears next to the original. Just as quickly,<br>
    the duplicate flower disappears into a tiny red dot,<br>
    which instantly DEMATERIALIZES...</p>
  <p>11 ANGLE - CLARA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The glowing pinpoint of light MATERIALIZES again and<br>
    stops, as if spotting Clara. It hovers, as if watching<br>
    her from afar...</p>
  <p>11A CLOSE ON CLARA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> She is by herself, kneeling on a patch of dirt among<br>
    the trees and bushes. As she plants seeds into the<br>
    soil, she talks to her imaginary friend Isabella...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; - REV. 2/26/92 - TEASER 6B.</p>
  <p>11A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    See, Isabella... you have to push<br>
    your finger into the soil as deep<br>
    as you can.</p>
  <p> Clara picks up a watering container, and waters the<br>
    seeds.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    The baby seeds are very small...<br>
    so we mustn't give them too much<br>
    to drink.</p>
  <p> Clara sets down the water, and begins to pat down the<br>
    soil with her hands. She hums a nursery rhyme as she<br>
    works, obviously enjoying her day at the arboretum...</p>
  <p> Then, with out warning, the point of light flies<br>
    directly into Clara's head -- Clara's head GLOWS, as if<br>
    the light is scanning her mind (same glow effect as<br>
    the flower). The red light PULSES like it did in the<br>
    flower -- then vanishes. Clara doesn't notice a thing.<br>
    She keeps humming her song...</p>
  <p> Slowly, another girl's VOICE starts to hum along with<br>
    Clara. Clara stops, looks around.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Hello? Is somebody there?</p>
  <p> Suddenly, behind Clara, a figure steps into view. It's<br>
    a young girl, slightly taller than Clara, and a few<br>
    years older (she should appear to be around twelve).<br>
    This is ISABELLA. She has blonde hair and wears a blue<br>
    dress with white buttons. She looks exactly as Clara<br>
    described her -- and yet, there is something alien and<br>
    spooky about the girl. She doesn't smile... and her<br>
    face is expressionless, cold...</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    (to Clara)<br>
    Hello.</p>
  <p> Clara whips around and sees Isabella -- she reacts,<br>
    wide-eyed with astonishment.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Isabella?</p>
  <p> The other girl, Isabella, studies Clara.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Hello, Clara.</p>

  <p>12 INT. ARBORETUM</p>
  <p> As before. Clara facing Isabella, confused by the<br>
    sight -- after all, she's never actually seen her<br>
    imaginary friend.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Isabella... How come I can see<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> Isabella is expressionless.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Is something wrong with the way<br>
    I look?</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    No. I've just never seen you<br>
    before. Not for real.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Well... now you can see me for<br>
    real. Doesn't that make you<br>
    happy?</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Yes... it's wonderful!</p>
  <p> Isabella glances where Clara was planting seeds.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Can we go now?</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    We should finish planting the<br>
    seeds.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    I'm tired of planting. Let's do<br>
    something else.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Like what?</p>

  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Like...<br>
    (pointedly)<br>
    I would really like to explore<br>
    the ship.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    We should finish planting first.<br>
    I promised Keiko.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    We can finish later. Let's go<br>
    look around.</p>
  <p> Isabella moves to Clara and takes her by the hand.<br>
    Clara stands up, hesitant.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    I'd better ask my daddy.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Your daddy won't mind. We can<br>
    tell him later. Come on...</p>
  <p> Isabella tugs Clara along -- big sister leading younger<br>
    sister. She's persuasive, more sophisticated than<br>
    Clara. There is an intelligence at work here. This is<br>
    no ordinary &quot;imaginary friend.&quot; Isabella is hard to<br>
    deny -- Clara smiles and goes along. As they EXIT hand<br>
    in hand...</p>
  <p>13 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Geordi, Data and Sutter working at various consoles,<br>
    collecting data from the nebula. N.D.s as needed.<br>
    Geordi's console displays a GRAPHIC of the nebula.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So what are we going to name this<br>
    nebula? &quot;FGC-four-seven&quot; just<br>
    doesn't have a nice ring to it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; - 2/24/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SUTTER<br>
    (with humor)<br>
    Why don't we call it... &quot;Sutter's<br>
    Cloud?&quot;</p>
  <p> Data works his console.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The rotational period of the<br>
    neutron star is one point three<br>
    five seconds.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's a bit on the long side.<br>
    Sutter -- let's see if we can get<br>
    a reading on the particle flux.</p>
  <p> SUTTER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Sutter works his console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I was thinking more along the<br>
    lines of &quot;The La Forge Nebula.&quot;<br>

    you think?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Based on those selections, I would<br>
    prefer FGC-four-seven.</p>
  <p> Geordi and Sutter laugh. Data misses the joke.<br>
    Suddenly, the ship TREMBLES slightly, and the lights<br>
    FLICKER. Reactions.</p>
  <p> SUTTER<br>
    What was that?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It felt like we hit something.</p>

  <p> CLARA<br>
    I'm Clara Sutter.<br>
    (points to Sutter)<br>
    That's my daddy.</p>
  <p> Sutter looks up and sees Clara -- his face drops. What<br>
    is she doing here? He gives Geordi an apologetic look<br>
    as he moves to Clara. He speaks to her in a hushed,<br>
    terse tone of voice.</p>
  <p> SUTTER<br>
    Clara, you can't be here right<br>

  <p> CLARA<br>

  <p> This is the last thing Sutter wants to hear.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>20 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Data, Geordi discussing their situation.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't have an explanation, sir.<br>
    We seemed to hit something... and<br>
    then we started losing speed.<br>
    But so far as we can tell, there's<br>
    nothing out there to hit.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Could some kind of damping field<br>
    cause us to lose velocity?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We simulated several such fields,<br>
    but were unable to reproduce the<br>
    same drag coefficient.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We also don't know why the problem<br>
    suddenly corrected itself.</p>
  <p> They are all intrigued by the mystery... none more than<br>
    Picard, whose scientific curiosity has been whetted.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It seems we're observing a unique<br>
    phenomenon... one that hasn't<br>
    been recorded before.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The question is, do we stay here<br>
    and check it out?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That may be dangerous.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Since we have experienced the<br>
    phenomenon only once, it is<br>
    impossible to estimate the risks.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; - REV. 2/25/92 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Geordi responds to the challenge... if something<br>

    I'd like to stick around a little<br>
    longer, sir... collect a sample<br>
    of the gaseous matter, see what<br>
    it tells us...</p>
  <p> Picard considers. Like Geordi, he's propelled by the<br>

  <p> CLARA<br>
    That's the door to the cargo bay.<br>
    We can't go in there.</p>
  <p> They continue along...</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Let's go someplace with lots of<br>
    people.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Okay.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Isabella, why are you so serious<br>
    lately?</p>
  <p> Isabella looks at her.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    What do you mean?</p>

  <p> CLARA<br>
    You haven't even smiled once<br>
    today.</p>
  <p> Isabella considers the remark in her unemotional way.<br>
    Suddenly, Clara stops, turns to Isabella and makes a<br>
    funny face. Isabella reacts, taken aback by the<br>
    display -- then, gradually, she breaks out in the<br>
    beginnings of a smile. She touches her mouth and face,<br>
    as if she doesn't quite know what a smile is...</p>

  <p>21 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> They continue walking. Clara watches Isabella<br>
    happily...</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    You're my best friend, Isabella.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> Clara thinks.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    I don't know. Because we do<br>
    things together... and we trade<br>
    secrets.</p>
  <p> Isabella considers this. It is a difficult concept for<br>
    her alien mind to grasp.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Does everybody have a best friend?</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    If they're lucky. Before I had<br>
    you, I didn't have one...</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Why not?</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Every time I made friends with<br>
    someone... my daddy's job would<br>
    change and we'd move to a new ship.<br>
    And it takes time to make best<br>
    friends...</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    How long?</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    It depends. With you... not very<br>
    long. You always listened to me,<br>
    even when I was sad...</p>
  <p> Isabella turns this over in her mind.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Clara... I'm glad we're best<br>
    friends.</p>
  <p> Clara smiles at her, good feelings abounding, youthful<br>
    ebullience overflowing.</p>

  <p> Clara takes off running down the corridor. Isabella<br>
    hesitates, unsure what to do -- then she starts<br>
    running, too. Clara has the lead but Isabella is<br>
    quickly catching up...</p>
  <p>22 INCLUDE WORF</p>
  <p> rounding a corner at a good clip. Both girls nearly<br>
    collide with him. They stop, breathless and startled<br>
    by the towering Klingon. Worf gives the girls a stern<br>
    look.</p>

    takes a step back. Worf realizes he's scared her, and<br>
    despite his hurry, softens his tone.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Are you lost?</p>
  <p> Both girls are speechless.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Where are you supposed to be?</p>
  <p> Clara bravely steps forward.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    (small voice)<br>
    We were only playing. We're<br>
    sorry.</p>
  <p> Worf is affected by Clara's tiny charm. He gives the<br>
    girls a faint smile.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Return to your quarters. And we<br>
    will forget this incident.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Thank you!</p>
  <p> The girls turn back the way they came, and disappear<br>
    around a corner. Satisfied, Worf continues on his<br>
    way...</p>
  <p> After a moment, Isabella peers around the corner to<br>
    make sure the coast is clear. It is. She hurries back<br>
    out into the corridor, yanking a resistant Clara along<br>

  <p> SUTTER<br>
    Commander...</p>
  <p> Geordi hears something in his voice, glances at him.</p>
  <p> SUTTER<br>
    I understand... that you had a<br>
    parent in Starfleet.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Two of them, as a matter of fact.<br>
    My father was an exozoologist...<br>
    my mother a command officer.</p>
  <p> SUTTER<br>
    They must have been posted to a<br>
    lot of different assignments...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's putting it mildly. They<br>
    were always on the move... some<br>
    of the time together, some times<br>
    separately... I never knew if<br>
    I was going to be stationed with<br>
    my dad while he studied<br>
    invertebrates in the Modean<br>
    system... or with my mom on some<br>
    outpost near the Neutral Zone.</p>
  <p> SUTTER<br>
    Was that hard on you?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't remember it that way...</p>
  <p> Sutter gives him an uncertain look.</p>
  <p> SUTTER<br>
    But... it must have been<br>
    disruptive if you didn't stay<br>
    in one place long enough to make<br>
    friends...</p>
  <p> Geordi, on the other hand, knows what Sutter is worried<br>
    about, and taps into his concerns.</p>

  <p> Guinan looks around, sees no one, but is cool.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Well, ordinarily you're supposed<br>
    to be here with a grown-up... but<br>
    since you've brought Isabella,<br>

  <p> GUINAN<br>
    It was a Tarcassian razor beast.<br>
    It had dark brown fur, gold<br>
    eyes... huge spiny wings... It<br>
    could fly so fast that no one<br>
    could see it... except me.</p>
  <p> Clara's eyes go wide -- she's enchanted by the<br>
    description...</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Sounds scary.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    It was... especially when it<br>
    smiled.</p>
  <p> Clara smiles at this.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    But the best thing about it was<br>
    that I could curl up and lie on<br>
    its furry stomach. It had the<br>
    deepest, softest purr you've ever<br>
    heard... it put me to sleep<br>
    every night...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    That razor beast was a good<br>
    friend.</p>
  <p> Clara thinks about this.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    So is Isabella.</p>
  <p> They share a smile.</p>

    Hello, Clara.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Hello...</p>

  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    I was just talking with Clara and<br>
    Isabella.</p>
  <p> Troi smiles at Guinan, then turns to Clara.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Clara... would you and Isabella<br>
    like to take a walk with me?</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    I guess so.<br>
    (to Guinan)<br>
    'Bye.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    See you later, Clara...<br>

  <p> Troi and Clara walking up to a turbolift. Troi hits<br>
    the button by the door and they wait...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Clara, you haven't been on this<br>
    ship very long, so maybe you don't<br>
    know that Ten Forward is usually<br>
    for grown-ups.</p>
  <p> Clara frowns -- after all, this isn't really her fault.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    I know that. I didn't want to<br>
    go. But Isabella wanted to see<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If Isabella is telling you to do<br>
    things you know are wrong... then<br>
    you must tell her it's not<br>
    acceptable.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; - REV. 2/26/92 - ACT TWO 22B.</p>
  <p>26A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    (to Clara)<br>
    Would you like me to talk to<br>
    Isabella for you?</p>
  <p> Clara shrugs. Troi looks next to Clara.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Isabella... it's not very nice<br>
    to tell Clara to do things she<br>
    isn't supposed to.</p>
  <p> Clara reacts, as though hearing a voice next to her.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    She's over here.</p>
  <p> Troi speaks to the other side of Clara.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    From now on... I want you to ask<br>
    a grown-up before you go places<br>
    that are off-limits.</p>
  <p> Clara leans over, as if listening to something Isabella<br>
    is whispering to her. She frowns, then glances at<br>
    Troi.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What did she say?</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    She said...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; - REV. 2/26/92 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>26B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Clara trails off, uncomfortable, not wanting to repeat<br>
    what she heard.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Clara. Please tell me what<br>
    Isabella said.</p>
  <p> Clara looks uncomfortable -- she moves in close to<br>
    Troi, so Isabella can't hear what she's saying.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    (whispers)<br>
    She said... you better leave us<br>
    alone.</p>
  <p> Clara looks at the floor, feeling awful. OFF Troi's<br>

  <p>27 INT. SUTTER'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Troi and Sutter together in Sutter's side of the room<br>
    (Clara's room is adjacent, separated by a door).</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm a little concerned about the<br>
    turn this is taking. It seems<br>
    Clara is starting to do<br>
    inappropriate things... and she's<br>
    blaming them on Isabella.</p>
  <p> Sutter reacts.</p>
  <p> SUTTER<br>
    She came into engineering today...<br>
    and said it was Isabella's idea.</p>
  <p> Sutter looks concerned. Troi tries to ease his mind.</p>

  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't think it's too serious<br>
    yet. But we should make more of<br>
    an effort to get her involved with<br>
    real friends her own age.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The Children's Center is having<br>
    a ceramics class this afternoon.<br>
    Why don't I take Clara?</p>
  <p> Sutter cheers up a little.</p>
  <p> SUTTER<br>
    I think she'd like that.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'll see if there's room left in<br>
    the class. In the meantime, make<br>
    yourself available to Clara. Let<br>
    her know she doesn't have to rely<br>
    on Isabella when she needs someone<br>
    to talk to.</p>
  <p> Sutter nods, hopeful.</p>
  <p> SUTTER<br>
    Thank you, Counselor.</p>
  <p>28 INT. CLARA'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Clara is putting together a futuristic jigsaw puzzle.<br>
    She is solemn, after all that's happened today.<br>
    Isabella watches from across the room... then finally<br>
    approaches her...</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Are you mad at me?</p>
  <p> Clara shrugs, keeps working on the puzzle.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    (sweetly)<br>
    I'm sorry I got you in trouble.</p>
  <p> Clara looks up at her, brightened by the apology.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    That's okay.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; - REV. 2/25/92 - ACT TWO 25.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Are we still... best friends?</p>
  <p> Clara smiles, nods emphatically. She holds out a<br>
    puzzle piece.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Here -- you can help me put this<br>
    together, if you want.</p>
  <p> Isabella takes the piece. They start to put the puzzle<br>
    together...</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Clara... Why are grown-ups so<br>
    mean?</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    They're not mean -- they're just<br>
    more serious than we are.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Sometimes I wish they'd just go<br>
    away.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    You do?</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Yes... I don't like them.</p>
  <p> A beat. Then Isabella focuses on Clara -- she is<br>
    testing Clara's loyalties...</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    I'm bored. Let's go back to<br>
    engineering.</p>
  <p> Clara reacts -- not again. She holds firm.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    We're not allowed to go there.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; - REV. 2/25/92 - ACT TWO 26.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Isabella's expression hardens -- she tosses down a<br>
    puzzle piece, unhappy with the response. Isabella is<br>
    manipulating Clara, working on the young girl's<br>
    affections. It's an eerie sight -- Isabella has a<br>
    hidden agenda and she's using Clara to get it...</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    I thought we were best friends.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    We are.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Then why won't you play with me?</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    I told you...</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    You always listen to the<br>
    grown-ups. You don't care about<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> Clara looks hurt.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    That's not true.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    I thought we'd have fun<br>
    together, once you could really<br>
    see me. I thought you'd like<br>
    me...</p>
  <p> Clara is speechless. Isabella moves close to her,<br>
    putting on the pressure, trying to persuade Clara...</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Let's go to engineering, Clara.<br>
    Just for a little while. No one<br>
    will know -- it'll be our secret.<br>
    And if they find us, we'll tell<br>
    them we got lost...</p>
  <p> Before Clara can respond, the door CHIMES.</p>

  <p> Isabella DEMATERIALIZES. Clara moves to the doors and<br>
    touches a button. The doors slide open, and Troi<br>
    ENTERS.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Hello, Clara.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Hi.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I came to ask if you'd like to<br>
    come to a ceramics class.</p>
  <p> Clara likes the idea.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Can Isabella come, too?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, Clara. We'll do something<br>
    with Isabella another day.</p>
  <p> Clara glances around the room, uneasy about leaving<br>
    Isabella behind.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Well...<br>
    (makes the decision)<br>
    Okay.</p>
  <p> Troi smiles, and takes Clara by the hand. They EXIT.</p>
  <p> After a beat, Isabella APPEARS. Her face is a mixture<br>
    of jealousy and anger -- Clara has left her and she<br>
    hates it. Her eyes start to GLOW a deep red color,<br>
    as if with alien rage...</p>

    Is it anything the shields can't<br>

    No, sir, we are well within<br>

    No, sir. There is no indication<br>

  <p> WORF<br>

  <p>30 INT. ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi and Sutter are studying a clear TUBE, which<br>
    contains a sampling of red gas from the nebula. Sutter<br>
    scans the tube with a TECH device, while Geordi works<br>
    a console.</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS and approaches the team.</p>

  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Any luck?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah -- take a look at this...</p>
  <p> Geordi is excited -- their work is going well. He<br>
    indicates the tube.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We tried radiating the matter<br>
    sample with just about everything<br>
    we could think of. We didn't find<br>
    anything... until we subjected<br>
    it to a high frequency warp<br>
    field...</p>
  <p> Geordi looks to Sutter, who activates the TECH device.<br>
    It casts a GLOW onto the matter, causing a single<br>
    thread-like STRAND to appear. Geordi points to the<br>
    strand.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re: strand)<br>
    This may be what we've been<br>
    running into...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you know what it is?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; - REV. 2/25/92 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We think so. Now that the sensors<br>
    can read it, it seems to be a<br>
    highly cohesive form of plasma<br>
    -- like a strand of energy.</p>
  <p> SUTTER<br>
    We figure this segment is just<br>
    part of a network of much larger<br>
    strands.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    When these things come in contact<br>
    with our shields, it produces a<br>
    resonant effect -- and creates the<br>
    drag coefficient we've been<br>
    experiencing.</p>
  <p> Riker eyes the strand with curiosity.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Anything like this on record?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Riker is intrigued, but concerned.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Any idea how many more of these<br>
    there might be?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No. But if we run the warp field<br>
    generators through the deflector<br>
    grid, we could radiate a field<br>
    outside the ship.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    ... and we'd see for ourselves.<br>
    Let's do it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> Clara looks at the CUP -- it's a huge and lopsided<br>
    goblet covered with spikes. A Klingon child's version<br>
    of a cup. Clara looks at Troi, as if for permission.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's alright...</p>
  <p> Clara sits down at the table and eagerly begins to<br>
    stick clay spikes onto the cup. Alexander stops her,<br>
    and politely shows her the right way to do it.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    You gotta put them all in a row...<br>
    like this...</p>
  <p> Clara quickly gets the hang of it. She looks at<br>
    Alexander and smiles. Clearly, they're hitting it off.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Clara, would you like some clay<br>
    of your own?</p>
  <p> But Clara is already absorbed in the activity, talking<br>
    quietly with Alexander.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    I've never made a cup before.<br>
    How do you do the round part?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    It's easy. Just take a big piece<br>

    My father took me to the zoo on<br>

    was lick my hand. And he smelled<br>
    funny.</p>
  <p> Clara giggles. She tries to place another spike on<br>
    the cup, but it won't stick.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    I think we need more water.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I'll get some.</p>

  <p> Alexander turns to pick up a bowl of water. Just then,<br>
    a block of clay on the table tips over, as if pushed<br>
    by an invisible hand. It drops straight into the cup,<br>
    demolishing it. Clara reacts -- realizing what has<br>
    happened...</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>

    I didn't do it.</p>

  <p> CLARA<br>
    I didn't do it! I didn't!</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    There's no such thing as invisible<br>

  <p> Alexander turns to walk away. Suddenly, a sloppy lump<br>

  <p> CLARA<br>
    Why are you being so mean to me?<br>
    Why'd you do that to my friend?</p>
  <p> Isabella is cold, impersonal -- creepy.</p>

  <p> CLARA<br>
    You're scaring me.</p>

    sinister red GLOW. Her true alien persona is rising to<br>
    the surface, and it's a terrifying sight...</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    I was going to protect you, Clara.<br>

  <p>49 INTERCUT: VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Something is visible moving through the strands -- it<br>
    looks like a spindly BALL of crackling ENERGY. And<br>
    it's heading toward the ship...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What is it?</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    It appears to be an energy<br>
    vortex... of highly complex<br>
    patterns. Very possibly a life<br>
    form.</p>
  <p> Reactions. On the viewscreen, several more ENERGY<br>
    BALLS come into view one after another...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Red Alert!</p>
  <p> The ship goes to RED ALERT. On the screen, one of the<br>
    energy creatures FLIES quickly toward us and WHAM!<br>
    The ship SHAKES.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is in direct physical contact<br>
    with the shields.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Shields dropping to seventy-five<br>
    percent... seventy-two percent...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (realizing)<br>
    The damn thing's feeding off<br>
    our shields. Data -- remodulate<br>
    the shield frequencies!</p>

    Shields to sixty-four percent.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off console)<br>
    We have about eight minutes before<br>
    those things drain our shields.</p>
  <p> A tense beat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Any ideas?</p>
  <p> Picard considers their next move. OFF his grim face...</p>
  <p>50 INT. ARBORETUM</p>
  <p> Picard, Worf, Sutter and Clara ENTER. Clara breaks<br>
    free from the adults and starts to search for Isabella.<br>
    She calls out softly...</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Isabella... Isabella...</p>
  <p> No response. The adults follow as Clara ventures<br>
    deeper through the trees and flowers...</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Isabella... Don't you want to talk<br>
    to me? I'm not mad at you...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; - REV. 2/27/92 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard steps forward, makes an appeal to the invisible<br>
    Isabella. He knows he's dealing with an alien, and<br>
    takes the appropriate tack -- he's reasonable but<br>
    commanding, trying to draw her out...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We know you've been on the ship<br>
    for some time now. We know you've<br>
    been posing as Clara's friend --<br>
    and that you've been threatening<br>
    her...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We can only assume there's a<br>
    connection between you and the<br>
    life-forms attacking our ship...</p>
  <p> Picard waits for a response. Nothing. He<br>
    continues...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are obviously an intelligent<br>
    being. There's no reason for<br>
    you to hide...</p>
  <p> The ship SHAKES. Picard is growing frustrated. He<br>
    challenges the alien to appear...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Talk to us. Or can you only<br>
    communicate by frightening a small<br>
    child?</p>
  <p> Silence. Clara calls out...</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    I'm scared, Isabella...</p>
  <p> A beat. Then Picard and Clara see something...</p>
  <p>51 INCLUDE ISABELLA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As she MATERIALIZES in the clearing where Clara was<br>
    planting seeds. Her face is neutral. Picard, Worf<br>
    and Sutter react to the sight. Isabella sees them and<br>
    tenses. Picard proceeds with caution...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Isabella)<br>
    Who are you?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; - REV. 2/28/92 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>51 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Isabella speaks in a neutral voice. Although she looks<br>
    like a Human girl, her alien persona is more obvious<br>
    than ever -- she's sophisticated, intelligent, guarded.<br>
    It's a strange and unnerving sight...</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    I came here to determine whether<br>
    you were a threat to us. And to<br>
    examine the purity of your energy<br>
    sources.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Energy... is that why they're<br>
    draining our shields?</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Yes. The emissions from your<br>
    graviton field generators are<br>
    far richer than our normal<br>
    sources of energy.</p>
  <p> The ship SHUDDERS -- the LIGHTS FLICKER and GO OUT,<br>
    and the EMERGENCY LIGHTS come on.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (taps communicator)<br>
    Picard to bridge. Report.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Shields are down to three percent.<br>
    We're diverting all available<br>
    power.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Acknowledged.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Isabella, makes an urgent appeal.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If it's energy you want, we can<br>
    provide it in other ways. You<br>
    needn't destroy us.</p>
  <p> Isabella is cold, emotionless.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    You should be destroyed. You are<br>
    cruel, uncaring creatures.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; - REV. 3/03/92 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>51 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    What makes you say that?</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    The way you treat Clara.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    In what way did we mistreat her?</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    You wouldn't let her do what she<br>
    wanted to... or go where she<br>
    wanted to...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    You mean where you wanted her to.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    Why does that make a difference?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You were taking her to places that<br>
    were inappropriate -- even<br>
    dangerous.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    I wouldn't have let anything<br>
    happen to her...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We had no way of knowing that.<br>
    We had no way of knowing you were<br>
    real. All we knew was that a<br>
    little girl's imaginary friend<br>
    was scaring her... threatening<br>
    her...</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    That was only after you tried to<br>
    keep her from being my friend.</p>
  <p> A dawning realization...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm beginning to understand.<br>
    You've seen this ship... all of<br>
    us... from a unique perspective<br>
    -- a child's point of view. It<br>
    must have seemed terribly unfair<br>
    and restrictive...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; - REV. 3/03/92 - ACT FIVE 52A.</p>
  <p>51 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> A beat... he nods thoughtfully to himself, glancing<br>
    at the other adults... with almost a smile...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As adults, we don't always stop<br>
    to realize how everything we say<br>
    and do shapes the impressions of<br>
    young people.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But if you are to judge us as a<br>
    people by the way we treat our<br>
    children... and I cannot think<br>
    of a better criterion... you must<br>
    understand how deeply we care for<br>
    them. When our children are<br>
    young, they cannot always<br>
    understand what might be<br>
    dangerous. Our rules are a way<br>
    to keep them from harm. Either<br>
    real or imagined.</p>
  <p> Picard puts his hand on Clara's shoulder...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is part of the continuity<br>
    of the Human species. You see...<br>
    when Clara grows up, she will make<br>
    rules for her children... to<br>
    protect them... just as we<br>
    protect her.</p>
  <p> Isabella contemplates the words. She glances at Clara,<br>
    uncertain. Clara moves close to Isabella, makes a tiny<br>
    appeal to the alien...</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    Please don't hurt us.</p>
  <p> The simplicity of her remark is touching. Isabella<br>
    looks at her, softening a bit.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    If you still want to be my best<br>
    friend, I'd like it very much.</p>
  <p> Isabella wavers. Clearly, she has developed an<br>
    unexpected and genuine affection for Clara. The ship<br>
    SHAKES. And SHAKES again. It prompts Isabella to make<br>
    the decision...</p>
  <p> Isabella DEMATERIALIZES. A red point of LIGHT is all<br>
    that's left -- it flits about, then flies upward and<br>
    vanishes through the ceiling...</p>

  <p> Clara ENTERS from Sutter's room and sits down on her<br>
    bed. She yawns, tired after all that's happened. A<br>
    quiet moment passes by as she pulls back her covers and<br>
    fluffs her pillow...</p>
  <p> Isabella MATERIALIZES next to the bed. Clara reacts,<br>
    surprised. A tense beat as they stare at one<br>
    another... then Isabella's cold demeanor softens<br>
    slightly...</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    I came to say... I'm sorry I<br>
    frightened you.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    It's okay.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    And I misled you. I wasn't really<br>
    your Isabella.</p>
  <p> Clara smiles at her, with the expansive forgiveness<br>
    of children.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
    For a while you were.</p>
  <p> Isabella looks at Clara, touched by the child's<br>
    innocence and friendliness.</p>
  <p> ISABELLA<br>
    I never had a friend before.</p>
  <p> CLARA<br>
