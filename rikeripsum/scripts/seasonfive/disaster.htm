    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is motionless in space.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, stardate 45156.1.<br>
    Our mission to Mudor Five has<br>
    been completed and since our next<br>
    assignment will not begin for<br>
    several days, we are enjoying a<br>
    welcome respite from our duties.</p>
  <p>2 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> RIKER, DATA, and WORF are clustered around O'BRIEN and<br>
    a pregnant KEIKO (about eight months along). O'Brien<br>
    and Keiko have that proud-but-nervous look of<br>
    expectant parents. While Data are Riker are very<br>
    interested in Keiko's pregnancy, Worf looks<br>
    exceptionally bored.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    If it's a boy... Michael. After<br>
    my father.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Wait a minute... we decided on<br>
    Hiro, after my father.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    We talked about this last night.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    That's right, and we decided on<br>
    Hiro.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Wait. I've got it. How about...<br>
    William. Now there's a name...<br>
    William O'Brien. That has a nice<br>
    ring to it.</p>
  <p> That gets a few chuckles. Keiko laughs gently... then<br>
    she suddenly puts a hand to her stomach.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/14/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker looks concerned but Keiko smiles at him.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    It's all right. He's just doing<br>
    somersaults.</p>
  <p> She takes Riker's hand and places it on her swollen<br>
    belly.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Right... there!</p>
  <p> Riker smiles at the sensation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He's going to be a hell of a<br>
    gymnast.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Keiko)<br>
    May I?</p>
  <p> She nods and Data carefully puts his hand near<br>
    Riker's. Worf is so bored that he all but yawns as he<br>
    watches this occur. Data's expression is curious...<br>
    childlike. The child kicks again and Data reacts.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    (weary smile)<br>
    If he's not turning, he's kicking<br>
    and punching. When I want to<br>
    sleep, he wants to wake up. At<br>
    this point, I just wish it were<br>
    over.</p>
  <p> Data removes his hand.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (to Keiko)<br>
    Have to go -- I've got a<br>
    transporter simulation to run on<br>
    the bridge.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/12/91 - TEASER 2A.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He kisses his wife and then puts his hand on her<br>
    stomach.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/15/91 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (continuing, to unborn<br>
    child)<br>
    Good-bye, Michael.</p>
  <p> O'Brien smiles at Keiko with humor and then he EXITS.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>3 INT. CARGO BAY</p>
  <p> BEVERLY is talking to GEORDI near a large stack of<br>
    containers. This is a very large cargo bay and there<br>
    is a door similar to the one in the shuttle bay that<br>
    opens to space. This door is smaller and it is<br>
    currently closed. The containers are marked<br>
    &quot;Hazardous&quot; and Geordi has been checking over some<br>
    manifests on a PADD.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Come on, Geordi</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Just try it once. It's not as<br>
    hard as you think. I'm telling<br>
    you... you'll be terrific.</p>
  <p> Geordi's still reluctant, but she's wearing him down.<br>
    He glances quickly around the bay to make sure no<br>
    one's watching then starts to quickly sing...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    &quot;... I am the very model of a<br>
    modern major general, I've<br>
    information vegetable, animal and<br>
    mineral... &quot;<br>
    (quickly embarrassed,<br>
    to Beverly)<br>
    I can't do this! I can't sing in<br>
    front of people.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes you can! That was terrific!<br>
    (she takes his arm)<br>
    Now you were a little off pitch,<br>
    but I think we can take care of<br>
    that...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/19/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> On Geordi's &quot;get me out of this&quot; expression...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>4 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> LIEUTENANT MONROE at conn, ENSIGN MANDEL at ops. Troi<br>
    is introducing three children to PICARD. The children<br>
    are: MARISSA, a painfully shy nine-year-old who looks<br>
    down at her shoes during the entire scene; JAY GORDON,<br>
    a very solemn, serious boy who looks Picard right in<br>
    the eye (he is a proper, polite boy who is eager to<br>
    please, rather adult); and PATTERSON, a lively six-<br>
    year-old with a winning smile and tons of energy.<br>
    Picard is a little ill-at-ease here... this is not<br>
    his favorite duty.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, I'd like to introduce<br>
    the winners of the primary school<br>
    science fair. This is Marissa,<br>
    Jay Gordon, and Patterson.<br>
    They're here for their tour.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hello.</p>
  <p> Marissa keeps staring at her shoes; Picard sees only<br>
    the top of her head. But --</p>
  <p> JAY GORDON<br>
    How do you do?</p>
  <p> PATTERSON<br>
    (a big voice)<br>
    Can we see the battle bridge?<br>
    And the torpedo bay?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm afraid not.<br>
    (trying to make it<br>
    sound fun)<br>
    But... we will be visiting both<br>
    the hydroponics and astrophysics<br>
    laboratories.</p>
  <p> Patterson's face falls slightly: &quot;Gee, what fun.&quot;</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to kids)<br>
    I'm sure you'll have a wonderful<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/12/91 - TEASER 4A.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> They're not quite convinced, but Picard presses<br>
    onward.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/15/91 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> O'Brien ENTERS in the b.g. and goes to work at the aft<br>
    science station.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well. If you'll come with me...</p>
  <p> He leads them to the forward turbolift and the four of<br>
    them EXIT. O'Brien and Troi exchange a look.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I'm not sure who to feel sorry<br>
    for... the captain or the kids.</p>
  <p> On Troi's smile...</p>
  <p>5 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> The turbolift is MOVING. There is a beat of awkward<br>
    silence as Picard and the kids look each other over.</p>
  <p> Picard tries to get things moving. He launches into<br>
    what we suspect is the same speech, year after year.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I want you all to know that we on<br>
    the Enterprise are very proud of<br>
    the science fair winners.<br>
    Perhaps some of you will choose<br>
    to pursue a career in Starfleet.<br>
    I heartily urge you to do so.</p>
  <p> He stops, looks at them. Marissa is still looking<br>
    down; the boys stare up at him, Patterson smiling, Jay<br>
    Gordon utterly serious, but they don't respond.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, then. Ah... what did you<br>
    do for your science projects?</p>
  <p> PATTERSON<br>
    (loudly)<br>
    I planted radishes in this<br>
    special dirt and they came up all<br>
    weird!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see. Very commendable.<br>
    (to Jay Gordon)<br>
    And you?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/15/91 - TEASER 5A.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JAY GORDON<br>
    An analysis of the life span of<br>
    the swarming moths of Gonal Four.<br>
    (with emphasis)<br>
    They only live for twenty hours.<br>
    Then they all die.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/14/91 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How interesting. And you --</p>
  <p> But before he can get to Marissa, suddenly the ship<br>
    ROCKS SLIGHTLY and the turbolift STOPS. Picard and<br>
    the kids are surprised for a moment, but before they<br>
    can say anything the ship SHAKES VIOLENTLY. The<br>
    LIGHTS start to race by, indicating that the<br>
    turbolift is FALLING in the shaft.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    Hang on -- we're falling!</p>
  <p> The top light goes OUT and the children SCREAM in<br>
    terror...</p>
  <p>6 INT. CARGO BAY</p>
  <p> Beverly and Geordi are shaken violently...</p>
  <p>7 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> People react in alarm as tables, chairs, and glassware<br>
    are shaken...</p>
  <p>8 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The violent shaking STOPS and the bridge crew tries to<br>
    sort things out for a moment. Lieutenant Monroe tries<br>
    to take charge as she climbs to her feet near the conn.</p>
  <p> MONROE<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> MANDEL<br>
    (reading console)<br>
    Sensors are picking up subspace<br>
    distortions and high-energy<br>
    particles directly to starboard.</p>
  <p> Monroe looks at the readings at the conn.</p>
  <p> MONROE<br>
    Looks like we ran into a quantum<br>
    filament.<br>
    (to O'Brien)<br>
    Damage report?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/15/91 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (reading aft science<br>
    console}<br>
    We've lost primary life-support.<br>
    Switching to secondary systems.<br>
    Impulse and warp engines are offline.</p>
  <p> MANDEL<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    There's another filament moving<br>
    toward us, sir!</p>
  <p> MONROE<br>
    (urgent, to com)<br>
    All decks brace for---</p>
  <p> She is cut off as the ship is VIOLENTLY SHAKEN. This<br>
    is the worst yet... people are slammed into walls...<br>
    the conn console EXPLODES in Monroe's face... and the<br>
    lights go OUT, leaving only the RED ALERT indicators<br>
    blinking in the darkness.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/12/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)</p>
  <p>9 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The Red Alert lights continue to blink on the darkened<br>
    bridge. For a moment there is only the sound of<br>
    crackling circuitry from the exploded conn console...<br>
    then a few moans as people start to come to. O'Brien<br>
    manages to stand and hit a button on one console...<br>
    then the bridge is dimly illuminated by emergency<br>
    lights. He helps Troi to her feet.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (a little shaky)<br>
    I'm all right.</p>
  <p> Mandel groans on the deck near ops. Troi helps him up<br>
    as O'Brien starts to check some consoles.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Medical team to the bridge.</p>
  <p> No response. Troi frowns and hits her communicator.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Troi to sickbay.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Troi to engineering.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Counselor Troi to any crewmember,<br>
    please acknowledge.</p>
  <p> She looks over at O'Brien, who looks helplessly at<br>
    several blank screens.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    The computer's down, looks like<br>
    we still have impulse power...<br>
    but not much else...</p>
  <p> Mandel gets to his feet and starts to check the three<br>
    turbolifts.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/12/91 - ACT ONE 8A.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (looks around)<br>
    Where's Lieutenant Monroe?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/15/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> O'Brien looks around the bridge, and then spots a body<br>
    lying near the conn console.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (indicates body)<br>
    Counselor...</p>
  <p>10 ON TROI AND O'BRIEN</p>
  <p> O'Brien kneels and turns the body over; it's Monroe.<br>
    He checks the arterial pulse, then shakes his head.</p>
  <p>11 OMITTED</p>
  <p>11A NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Mandel tries to key the panel next to the forward<br>
    turbolift.</p>
  <p> MANDEL<br>
    The turbolifts aren't working.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We're trapped up here.</p>
  <p> On their reactions...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>12 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> CLOSE ON Picard. He's unconscious, lying on his right<br>
    side with his right leg awkwardly folded underneath<br>
    him. From o.c. we hear the sound of children softly<br>
    crying. He begins to wake up and we MOVE TO REVEAL<br>
    that he's still in the turbolift. There are a couple<br>
    of emergency lights, but it's still pretty dark.<br>
    Marissa, Jay Gordon, and Patterson are huddled<br>
    together, watching Picard. Patterson is crying, Jay<br>
    Gordon is silent and withdrawn, and Marissa is<br>
    trembling.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (very hoarse)<br>
    Are you...<br>
    (tries to clear throat,<br>
    then louder)<br>
    Are you children all right?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/15/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The children just stare at him, too scared to speak.<br>
    Picard tries to sit up... then lets out a painful<br>
    grunt as he moves his right leg, which causes the<br>
    children to flinch slightly. Picard moves more<br>
    gingerly and manages to get to a sitting position.</p>
  <p> He carefully moves the leg to a comfortable angle.<br>
    Picard hits his communicator.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard to bridge.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    This is the captain. Can anyone<br>
    hear me?</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> PATTERSON<br>
    Why don't they answer?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know.</p>
  <p> JAY GORDON<br>
    They're all dead.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (firm)<br>
    They're not dead. Communications<br>
    are down, that's all.</p>
  <p> He looks at the three tremulous faces staring at him.<br>
    They're trying, but they are little and scared.<br>
    Patterson is snuffling, about to lose it again;<br>
    Marissa looks like she could break down any second.<br>
    Jay Gordon is pale and remote, having accepted doom as<br>
    the only possible outcome.</p>
  <p> JAY GORDON<br>
    We're going to die, too.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We most certainly are not --</p>
  <p> But this pronouncement has set Patterson off. He<br>
    bursts into tears and Marissa gulps, ready to sob.</p>
  <p> Picard needs to get them under control and he puts all<br>
    his command presence into his voice and tries to take<br>
    charge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (firm)<br>
    Listen to me!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/12/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> They fall silent and look at him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    No one is going to die. The<br>
    bridge will send a rescue party<br>
    as soon as possible, so I want<br>
    you to stop crying. Everything<br>
    is going to be all right.</p>
  <p> The children look at him. It seems like Picard has<br>
    finally managed to get things under control... then<br>
    all three kids start crying again, even louder this<br>
    time. Picard will have to find some other way of<br>
    dealing with them.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>12A INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Troi and O'Brien are at the aft science station. The<br>
    console is mostly blank except for one or two<br>
    displays. Monroe's body has been moved off the<br>
    bridge.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (working console)<br>
    This is the Federation Starship<br>
    Enterprise calling any vessel<br>
    within range. We are in distress<br>
    and need assistance. Please<br>
    respond.<br>
    (beat, then to Troi)<br>
    I'm still not sure we're even<br>
    transmitting. I'll set the<br>
    message on auto-repeat and see if<br>
    we get a response.</p>
  <p> A sudden METALLIC NOISE from the aft turbolift (not<br>
    the same one Picard used) gets their attention. They<br>
    watch as the turbolift doors start to slowly open in<br>

    Are you all right?</p>
  <p> She steps onto the bridge.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I'm alive. What the hell<br>
    happened?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    We were hit by a quantum<br>
    filament. Most of our systems<br>
    are down and we haven't been able<br>
    to contact anyone off the bridge.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (indicates turbolift)<br>
    Well, don't count on leaving<br>
    through there. An emergency<br>
    bulkhead closed just beneath that<br>
    lift.</p>

  <p> RO<br>
    Right. Isolation protocol.</p>
  <p> Troi tries to remember, but she's not sure what<br>
    they're talking about.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm... not really familiar with<br>
    that protocol.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    If the computer senses a hull<br>
    breach, it automatically closes<br>
    emergency bulkheads to isolate<br>
    the breach. Until we can clear<br>
    those bulkheads, we'll be cut-off<br>
    from the rest of the ship.</p>

  <p> Mandel checks the console again.</p>
  <p> MANDEL<br>
    I'm sorry, Chief, but the<br>

  <p> O'Brien tries to put his personal feelings aside for<br>
    the moment.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (to Mandel)<br>
    Can you scan the drive section?</p>
  <p> Mandel works for a moment... then grimly relays the<br>
    news he sees on the console.</p>
  <p> MANDEL<br>
    I'm not reading any life-signs in<br>
    the drive section.</p>
  <p> Everyone reacts.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Could the sensors be<br>
    malfunctioning?</p>
  <p> MANDEL<br>

    There's no way to know. Without<br>
    the main computer, I can't run a<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    There are a lot of people still<br>
    alive... many of them are hurt...<br>

  <p> RO<br>
    We need to start emergency<br>

  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Lieutenant Monroe was in command,<br>
    but he's dead.</p>
  <p> There is a beat as O'Brien realizes what that means.<br>
    There hadn't been a chance to consider this question<br>
    before now.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I believe Counselor Troi is the<br>
    senior officer on the bridge.</p>

  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    She carries the rank of<br>
    Lieutenant Commander.</p>
  <p> Ro doesn't say anything more, but her doubts about<br>
    Troi are clear. Troi takes a beat as she realizes<br>
    that she's now in charge. Everyone is looking at<br>
    her... waiting for orders.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'd appreciate... some<br>
    suggestions.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I recommend we initiate emergency<br>

    (off her look)<br>
    By-pass computer control and<br>
    place all systems on manual<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Very well.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Aye aye, sir.</p>
  <p> He goes to the engineering console and starts to pull<br>
    off an access panel.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    May I suggest that our next<br>

  <p> The place is littered with broken tables, overturned<br>
    chairs, and smashed glassware. SEVERAL N.D.<br>
    CREWMEMBERS are injured and being helped by Worf, who<br>
    is carrying a medical tricorder and a first aid kit.<br>
    Riker is dressing a head wound on Keiko, who is lying<br>

  <p> Riker looks back at the injured people and thinks for<br>
    a beat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We should assume the worst...<br>
    that everyone on the bridge is<br>
    dead and no one is in control of<br>
    the ship.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In that circumstance, <br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Agreed. Can we get to<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    The direct route is blocked, but<br>
    there might be a way to reach it<br>
    through a starboard service<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Okay -- you and I will try to get<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay... clear the power shunt...<br>

  <p> Geordi goes to a section of wall near the door, kneels<br>
    down and begins removing a service panel. Beverly<br>
    follows him and stands near the wall to watch. As<br>
    Geordi gets the panel off the wall, Beverly notices<br>
    something. She feels the wall with her hand.</p>

  <p> Picard is propped against a wall and reaching up to<br>
    tinker with an open circuitry panel. Patterson is<br>
    sitting with his knees to his chest, rocking back and<br>
    forth; Jay Gordon is seated facing away from Picard.<br>
    Only Marissa stands, gravely watching what he's doing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The external power has been cut<br>

  <p> She nods solemnly.</p>
  <p> JAY GORDON<br>

    We're going to die.</p>
  <p> Patterson starts to rock a little faster and Picard<br>
    gives a frustrated look to Jay Gordon. Suddenly the<br>
    turbolift SHAKES. Then the sound of CREAKING METAL<br>
    for a moment, then silence.</p>
  <p> PATTERSON<br>
    (scared)<br>
    What was that?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know.</p>
  <p> Picard thinks for a moment... then he looks up at the<br>
    ceiling. He slowly pulls himself up on one leg and<br>
    tries to reach for the ceiling... but the movement<br>
    jars his leg painfully and he is unable to keep his<br>
    balance. Marissa takes a step back, eyes wide, trying<br>
    not to be afraid.</p>
  <p> The exertion takes a lot out of Picard and he sits<br>
    down. He looks up at sees Marissa's big dark eyes<br>
    staring at him. Nothing he's tried with these kids<br>
    has worked... the boys are frightened and cowed...<br>
    Marissa has yet to utter a word. And he can't get<br>
    them out of here by himself. He'd better find another<br>

  <p> MARISSA<br>
    (pointing)<br>
    Seven... and six.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, I'm going to need a first<br>

    Number One.</p>
  <p> This has a nice ring to it.</p>
  <p> MARISSA<br>
    Number One?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's what I've always called my<br>
    first officer. Here.</p>
  <p> Picard pulls off two of the rank pips from his collar<br>
    and pins them to Marissa's shirt. She touches them<br>
    with pride and, for the first time, smiles a sweet,<br>
    shy smile.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Now... we need a crew to help us<br>
    get that hatch off.</p>
  <p> He seems to think hard for a few seconds, then turns<br>
    toward the boys as though a new thought just occurred<br>
    to him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One... I think Jay might<br>
    make an excellent science<br>
    officer. Don't you agree?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/12/91 - ACT TWO 22.</p>

    Excuse me. It's Jay Gordon.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course. Forgive me. Jay<br>
    Gordon.</p>
  <p> JAY GORDON<br>
    I accept.</p>
  <p> Picard takes another pip and pins it on Jay Gordon.<br>
    As he does --</p>
  <p> PATTERSON<br>
    Can I be an officer, too?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's see... your science project<br>
    involved radishes, did it not?</p>
  <p> PATTERSON<br>
    Yeah... weird ones.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Excellent. You'll be our<br>
    executive officer in charge of<br>
    radishes.</p>
  <p> Picard gives him his own pip. The boys look proud as<br>

    They can be hundreds of meters<br>
    long, but they have almost no<br>
    mass... which is why they're so<br>
    difficult to detect.</p>
  <p> Troi thinks... tries to correlate this to her own<br>
    knowledge and experiences.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (unsure)<br>
    So, it's like a... cosmic string?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (gently)<br>
    No... that's a completely<br>
    different phenomenon.</p>
  <p> Troi is a little defeated, but she looks at the<br>
    monitor again, determined to understand this. But<br>
    before she can pursue the matter any further, there<br>
    are a series of loud BANGS and ELECTRONIC BEEPS<br>
    from...</p>
  <p>31 THE ENGINEERING STATION</p>
  <p> Ro is lying on her back, halfway inside the<br>
    engineering station. Tools and equipment are strewn<br>
    about next to her legs. O'Brien moves over and kneels<br>
    down in concern. He tries to see what she's doing,<br>
    but he can't. After a beat the engineering screen<br>
    flickers ON... fades... then comes on permanently.<br>
    Ro slides out of the console and gets to her feet.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (re: display)<br>
    How'd you do that?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I diverted power from the phaser<br>
    array and dumped it into the<br>
    engineering control system.</p>
  <p> O'Brien reacts sharply.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    You what?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (ignoring O'Brien)<br>
    The engineering station's on-line,<br>

  <p> O'BRIEN<br>

    That's a completely improper<br>

    much raw energy into a bridge<br>
    terminal without---</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (flatly cuts him off)<br>
    We aren't going to get out of<br>
    this by playing it safe.</p>
  <p> O'Brien is still upset, but Troi struggles to regain<br>
    control before they start to fight again.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to Ro)<br>
    What's our engine status, Ensign?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (works console)<br>
    We've got half impulse power<br>
    available.<br>
    (frowns)<br>
    But I'm getting some odd readings<br>
    from the warp drive...</p>
  <p> O'Brien moves in next to her and they both start to<br>
    work the console. As they converse in techno-<br>
    shorthand, Troi struggles to watch the screen and<br>
    understand what's going on, but she's way out of her<br>
    field here.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I'm reading a spike in the warp<br>

    containment deviation...</p>

  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Nothing. Field strength's at<br>
    forty percent and falling.</p>
  <p> A beat as they watch the screen. They exchange<br>
    looks... this is really bad. They turn to Troi, who<br>
    is completely lost at this point.</p>

  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    We've got a problem. The quantum<br>
    resonance of the filament caused<br>
    a polarity shift in the antimatter<br>
    containment field.</p>
  <p> Troi just looks at her: What the hell does that mean?<br>
    O'Brien hastens to explain.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    When the filament hit us, the<br>
    ship was momentarily charged...<br>
    as if it had... come into<br>
    contact with a live electrical<br>
    wire.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    That weakened the containment<br>
    field surrounding the antimatter<br>
    pods. The field strength is down<br>
    to forty percent and it's still<br>
    falling.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>

    If it falls to fifteen percent...<br>
    the field will collapse and<br>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>36 INT. JEFFRIES TUBE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker and Data are still stuck between the closed<br>
    hatch and the fluctuating power current. Data is<br>
    peering inside a power relay box in the wall near the<br>
    arcing power. He turns to Riker.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The current cannot be shut down<br>
    from this relay box.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    We can't just sit here.</p>
  <p> Data thinks for a moment and then looks at the power<br>
    flowing across the tube.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If the energy flowing through<br>
    this arc were interrupted by a<br>
    nonconductive material, it is<br>
    likely that the circuit would be<br>
    broken.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (looks around)<br>
    I don't see any material in here<br>
    that could stop that much<br>
    current.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (thinks)<br>
    Commander, most of my bodyframe<br>
    is composed of tripolymers, a non-<br>
    conductive material.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    You're suggesting using your own<br>
    body?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker looks at the crackling power arc.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/14/91 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, there's at least half a<br>
    million amps flowing through that<br>
    arc. Can you take that much<br>
    current?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The power surge would cause a<br>
    system failure in most of my<br>
    internal processors and melt my<br>
    primary power couplings.<br>
    However, there is a chance that<br>
    the damage would not be<br>
    irreparable.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander, our choices are very<br>
    limited.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    First of all, android or not, I<br>
    won't allow anyone to take that<br>
    kind of risk. Second, if the<br>
    computer isn't working in<br>
    engineering, I'm going to need<br>
    your help to get control of the<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (thinks)<br>
    My positronic brain has several<br>
    layers of shielding to protect it<br>
    from power surges. It would be<br>
    possible for you to remove my<br>
    cranial unit and take it with<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> Riker stares at him for a beat as it registers what<br>
    Data is asking him to do.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    You want me to take your head<br>
    off?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/12/91 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (surprised at the<br>
    reaction)<br>
    Yes, sir.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Is there something wrong?</p>
  <p> Riker recoils from the idea at first... then tries to<br>
    look at this pragmatically.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well, Data... it's just... I<br>
    mean, will you be all right?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My neural nets and memory core<br>
    are self-contained.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I will be fine.</p>
  <p> A long beat as Riker considers this.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Like you said... our choices are<br>
    very limited.</p>
  <p> Riker looks at him for a moment... finally nods and<br>
    gives him permission. Data processes for a very quick<br>
    beat... then turns around...</p>
  <p>37 ON DATA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As he turns and moves toward the arc. The power arc<br>
    snaps and crackles ominously... Data waits a beat...<br>
    then steps directly into the flow. There is a BRIGHT<br>
    FLASH and THUNDERCLAP as the current hits Data's body.<br>
    The energy holds him and shakes his body violently for<br>
    a couple of seconds.</p>
  <p>38 ON RIKER</p>
  <p> As he turns away in response to the bright flash.<br>
    After a beat, Riker turns back and then moves quickly<br>
    to find Data lying face down in the tube. The power<br>
    arc is gone, but Data's clothes and body have been<br>
    seared and blackened.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/15/91 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker turns Data over quickly... Data's face is blank<br>
    and doesn't react to Riker at all.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data? Data!</p>
  <p> There is a long beat before Data's eyes seem to focus<br>
    again and he is again aware of his surroundings.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A remarkable experience,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> Riker is relieved. Data runs some kind of internal<br>
    diagnostic.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How are you? Did the shielding<br>
    work?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (thinks)<br>
    Apparently so. My neural nets<br>
    are fully operational.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You may begin by opening the<br>
    ventral access panel located two<br>
    centimeters beneath my right ear.</p>

    the panel on Data's neck...</p>

  <p>40 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Picard is standing on his good leg and is holding Jay<br>
    Gordon up to the ceiling of the lift as Marissa helps<br>
    to steady Picard. The effort of holding Jay Gordon is<br>
    putting a tremendous strain on Picard. Jay puts his<br>
    hands on the ceiling.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/12/91 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (strained)<br>
    Feel around the edge of the<br>
    illumination module -- of the big<br>
    circle, until you find a small<br>
    knob.</p>
  <p> JAY GORDON<br>
    I have it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Now with your other hand, reach<br>
    around the far side of the<br>
    module... there should be another<br>
    knob.</p>
  <p> JAY GORDON<br>
    Okay, I found it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good. Good. Pull both knobs out<br>
    at the same time and then let go.</p>
  <p> He pulls the knobs and then there is a quick WHOOSH of<br>
    air as the top hatch moves upward slightly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Now push up... and slide the<br>
    hatch over to the side.</p>
  <p> Jay Gordon moves the hatch out of the way. The<br>
    turbolift SHAKES a little then stops. Patterson looks<br>
    around in terror and starts breathing quick and fast,<br>
    as if about to cry.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jay Gordon, can you pull yourself<br>
    up?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/14/91 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JAY GORDON<br>
    Yes. I think so.</p>
  <p> Jay Gordon pulls himself up through the hatch,<br>
    supports himself on his elbows and puts his feet on<br>
    Picard's shoulders.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you tell what deck we're on?<br>
    There should be a large number on<br>
    the wall of the shaft.</p>
  <p> JAY GORDON<br>
    It says &quot;eleven&quot;.</p>
  <p> That's bad news, but Picard tries not to show his<br>
    concern yet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good. Now look down at the side<br>
    of the lift. Do you see two big<br>
    clamps?</p>
  <p> JAY GORDON<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you see if both clamps are<br>
    connected to a... long beam<br>
    inside a... a big groove?</p>
  <p> Long beat.</p>
  <p> JAY GORDON<br>
    Yes. But one of them looks<br>
    broken. It's half out of the<br>
    groove.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right. Come down.</p>
  <p> Picard and Marissa help Jay Gordon down. Picard<br>
    carefully slides down to the floor. Picard realizes<br>
    they're in trouble... he takes a beat to think, then<br>
    he motions to Marissa to come closer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (softly)<br>
    Number One, those big clamps are<br>
    part of the emergency system. If<br>
    something goes wrong, they're<br>
    designed to hold the turbolift in<br>
    place.<br>

  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    But they seem to have been<br>
    damaged.</p>
  <p> MARISSA<br>
    Is that why we keep shaking?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's right.<br>
    (beat, then intimate)<br>
    When that clamp gives way, we'll<br>
    fall. You're going to have to<br>
    take your crew out of here before<br>
    that happens. There's a ladder<br>
    along the inside of the<br>
    turboshaft. You can use it to<br>
    climb up until you find an open<br>
    doorway.</p>
  <p> There is an ominous CREAK from the turbolift.</p>
  <p> MARISSA<br>
    (worried)<br>
    What about you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (honest)<br>
    My leg is broken. I'll only slow<br>
    you down and you need to move<br>
    quickly.<br>
    (a little firmly)<br>
    You'll have to be the leader.<br>
    That's an order.</p>
  <p> Marissa stands up... tries to summon up her courage.<br>
    She turns to Jay Gordon and Patterson. She tries to<br>
    put some command into her voice.</p>
  <p> MARISSA<br>
    We have to climb up the shaft.</p>
  <p> JAY GORDON<br>
    What about the captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not going. Commander Marissa<br>
    is in charge.</p>
  <p> PATTERSON<br>
    (getting scared)<br>
    I wanna stay here with you.</p>

    I don't wanna be an officer<br>
    anymore. I wanna stay with you.</p>
  <p> JAY GORDON<br>
    (to Marissa)<br>
    If the captain stays here, we<br>
    won't make it. We'll all die.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's no time to argue, you<br>
    have to go now.</p>
  <p> PATTERSON<br>
    I don't want to!</p>
  <p> Marissa thinks for a moment... then turns back to<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> MARISSA<br>
    The crew has decided to stick<br>
    together. We all go or we all<br>
    stay.</p>
  <p> Picard looks up at the hatch and then looks at the<br>
    children for a beat... he finally makes the decision.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right. I'll try. But I want<br>
    you to know... this is mutiny.</p>
  <p> This relieves them greatly. Picard painfully gets to<br>
    his feet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Number One, look at that panel...<br>
    do you see a bright yellow cap?</p>
  <p> MARISSA<br>
    (looks in panel)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Pull the cap toward you and then<br>
    turn it... it should come off.</p>
  <p> Marissa removes the cap. There is a bundle of wires<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Doctor, I've got an idea. It's<br>

  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If we open the external door it<br>
    would depressurize the cargo bay,<br>

    the lack of oxygen should knock<br>
    out the plasma fire.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What about us?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We'll have to find something in<br>

    is evacuated. After that, we'll<br>
    shut the door and repressurize<br>
    the bay.</p>
  <p> They both look around for a moment. The ladder<br>

  <p> The Crewman nods in appreciation and moves away. As<br>
    he leaves, a sudden flash of pain crosses Keiko's<br>
    face. She puts a hand to her stomach... but then the<br>
    pain passes. She seems okay for the moment, so she<br>

  <p> She sits, then gasps as a contraction grabs hold of<br>
    her again. She hunches over a little as Worf looks on<br>
    helplessly. When she looks up, her face is pale.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    I'm having contractions...</p>
  <p> This is not good news to Worf, who immediately goes<br>
    into denial.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I believe that is not uncommon in<br>
    the late months of pregnancy...</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>

  <p>44 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Troi, Ro, and O'Brien at the table. Troi is listening<br>
    quietly, absorbing the argument as the other two<br>
    battle it out.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (to Ro)<br>
    If the containment field strength<br>
    keeps dropping at this rate, we<br>
    still have at least two hours<br>
    before it becomes critical.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    But you're ignoring the fact that<br>
    the power coupling is also<br>
    damaged.<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    If that coupling overheats, the<br>
    field strength will begin to drop<br>
    a lot faster. We could have a<br>
    containment breach in a matter of<br>
    minutes.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What do you suggest?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    We should separate the saucer<br>
    now, and put as much distance as<br>
    possible between us and the drive<br>
    section.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Excuse me, sir, but that's damn<br>
    cold-blooded. What about the<br>
    people down there?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    There's no evidence anyone is<br>
    still alive in the drive section.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    There's no evidence they're dead,<br>
    either. If you were trapped down<br>
    there, would you want us to cut<br>
    you loose and leave?</p>

  <p>44 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Of course not. But I also<br>
    wouldn't expect the bridge crew<br>
    to risk the safety of the ship<br>
    and hundreds of lives in a futile<br>
    effort to rescue me.</p>
  <p> Troi stands and moves to the window. She looks out at<br>
    the stars for a long moment.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (without turning<br>
    around)<br>
    You said there's no way to<br>
    stabilize the containment field<br>
    from the bridge. Could it be<br>
    done from engineering?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Yes... but my readings indicate<br>
    there's no power down there.<br>
    They don't even have monitors to<br>
    tell them there's a problem.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Could we divert energy from the<br>
    bridge... to those monitors?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I'll say it again: there's no<br>
    reason to believe anyone's alive<br>
    in engineering. We're wasting<br>
    time even talking about this. We<br>
    have to separate the ship now.</p>
  <p> Troi thinks for another moment... finally makes a very<br>
    difficult decision. She turns back to face them.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I believe there are people still<br>
    alive down there... and I'm<br>
    going to give them every chance.</p>
  <p> She moves toward them.</p>

  <p>44 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Assuming they are alive, they'll<br>
    be hoping there's someone up here<br>
    to help them. So we'll help<br>
    them.<br>
    (to O'Brien<br>
    Divert the necessary power to<br>
    engineering.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (stands)<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Ro stands too, but she hasn't acquiesced.</p>

  <p>44 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I remind you, Counselor... that<br>
    power coupling could overheat at<br>
    any time. By not separating the<br>
    ship now, you may be responsible<br>
    for all our deaths.</p>
  <p> Troi looks her square in the eye.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Thank you, Ensign. Proceed.</p>
  <p> Ro turns and EXITS, leaving Troi to wrestle with the<br>
    consequences of her decision.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>45 INT. TURBOSHAFT</p>
  <p> The vertical shaft is very dark. There is a single<br>
    ladder that runs the length of the shaft. Picard is<br>
    on the ladder and is tied to Jay Gordon, Patterson and<br>
    Marissa in turn by optical cables that have been<br>
    fashioned into a safety rope. Picard is just below a<br>
    door that has the words &quot;DECK 7&quot; in big letters (the<br>
    turbolift was stuck on Deck 11). Picard is struggling<br>
    with an open panel in an effort to open the doors, but<br>
    it's very difficult to stay on the ladder and work the<br>
    panel with all his weight on one leg.</p>
  <p> Picard works for another moment... presses a final<br>
    relay and watches the doors... nothing happens. He<br>
    wants to scream in frustration, but he takes a beat to<br>
    get his temper under control.</p>

    Ready, sir.</p>
  <p> Jay Gordon and Patterson glumly nod and Picard begins<br>
    the slow process of pulling himself up the ladder,<br>
    using only his left leg. The children slowly follow<br>
    him up the ladder for a few beats... suddenly there<br>
    is a SOUND OF SHRIEKING METAL from o.c. Picard looks<br>
    down.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    The lift's falling! Hang on!</p>
  <p> They all freeze on the ladder just as there is a<br>
    WHOOSH and then a CRASH from below them which SHAKES<br>

    to cling to the ladder for dear life and his eyes are<br>
    shut tight with fear and his breathing is rapid.</p>

  <p> Including Picard and the other two children. He can't<br>
    see Patterson from his angle.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're all right. We're going to<br>
    keep climbing. Don't look down.</p>
  <p> Picard starts up, and Marissa and Jay Gordon follow,<br>
    but Patterson is frozen to the ladder... the optical<br>
    cable pulls Jay Gordon up short and he turns around.<br>
    Picard and Marissa also stop.</p>
  <p> JAY GORDON<br>
    (to Patterson)<br>
    What's wrong?</p>
  <p> MARISSA<br>
    He's scared.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Patterson)<br>
    We're right here with you,<br>
    Patterson. You're not going to<br>
    fall.</p>
  <p> Patterson closes his eyes and trembles slightly.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Everything will be all right if<br>
    you keep moving.</p>
  <p> Patterson doesn't respond except to clutch the ladder<br>
    tighter. Picard knows they have to get moving.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What we need -- is a climbing<br>
    song. Marissa, what's a song you<br>
    sing in school?</p>
  <p> MARISSA<br>
    &quot;The Laughing Vulcan and His Dog&quot;?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm afraid I don't know that one.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I know -- &quot;Frere Jacques&quot;. We<br>
    used to sing that when I was your<br>
    age. Patterson, do you know that<br>
    song?</p>
  <p> No response.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It goes like this... &quot;Frere<br>
    Jacques, Frere Jacques... &quot;</p>
  <p> MARISSA<br>
    &quot;... dormez vous, dormez vous... &quot;</p>
  <p> Picard, Marissa and Jay Gordon begin singing.</p>

  <p> Keiko has been moved away from everyone else to<br>
    provide some privacy and is propped up on some<br>
    cushions. She is in a lot of pain and she's very<br>
    sweaty and tired. Worf is kneeling next to her,<br>
    holding a PADD. The first aid kit is nearby. Worf is<br>
    way out of his element here, and he's uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Your contractions are now only<br>
    twenty seconds apart.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>

    That did not take long.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Easy for you to say...</p>
  <p> She breaks off as another contraction begins, closes<br>
    her eyes and breathes deeply to help deal with the<br>
    pain. Worf, feeling helpless, places his hand on her<br>
    belly.</p>

    You are doing very well. I am<br>

  <p> Keiko doesn't answer; she's too absorbed in managing<br>
    the contraction. Then it releases and her eyes open.<br>
    Worf studies the tricorder.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Worf... has the baby turned?</p>
  <p> Worf absorbs this question, tries to figure out what<br>
    in the world she's talking about. He is trying to be<br>
    the comforting expert in a situation where he's way<br>
    over his head.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Turned... ?</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Once the air is vented, the first<br>
    thing you'll feel is extreme<br>
    pressure in your lungs... you'll<br>
    have to resist the temptation to<br>
    exhale. Next, your hands and<br>

    &quot;processes&quot; for a moment. After a beat, the isolation<br>
    door begins to RISE.</p>
  <p>73C ON RIKER - INTERCUT WITH DATA AS NEEDED (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as he quickly moves under the door and goes into<br>
    Geordi's office. He is surprised that, in sharp<br>
    contrast to the outer area, Geordi's office is<br>
    completely powered up. Consoles are functioning and<br>
    the normal lights are on. Riker moves to a monitor.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There's no power on the entire<br>
    deck, but somehow these monitors<br>
    are working.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/15/91 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>73C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (thinks)<br>
    Commander, the power reaching<br>
    those monitors has been diverted<br>
    from the bridge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But why... ?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Unless there's something they<br>
    want us -- something they need us<br>
    to see...</p>
  <p> Riker moves to another console... the information on<br>
    the screen is shocking.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data -- the containment field<br>
    strength is down to eighteen<br>
    percent!</p>
  <p> Riker moves to Data out at the panel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    Can you stabilize it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (works)<br>
    I do not have access to the<br>
    containment field. You will have<br>
    to establish a new link.</p>
  <p> Riker moves closer to Data's head.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Locate the ODN conduit.</p>
  <p> Riker picks up a long strand of optical cable from the<br>
    panel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Got it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/15/91 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>73C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You must now change the input<br>
    matrix in my secondary optical<br>
    port and then connect the ODN<br>
    conduit.</p>
  <p> Riker grabs a hand tool and gingerly begins to poke<br>
    around inside the panel on Data's head. Data frowns.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is not the correct port,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sorry.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander, you must hurry, the<br>
    field has dropped to sixteen<br>
    percent.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm trying. You need a bigger<br>
    head.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The field is still dropping --<br>
    collapse is imminent.</p>
  <p> Riker finally makes the adjustment and then attaches<br>
    the optical cable to a spot in Data's head.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All right, try it!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (thinks)<br>
    I have a connection.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I am now stabilizing the<br>
    containment field.</p>
  <p> Riker breathes a sigh of relief.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's using your head, Data.</p>
  <p> Data gives him a curious look, but continues his work.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/16/91 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>74 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> O'Brien and Ro are at the monitors; Troi close by.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    All right. Stand by to separate<br>
    the Saucer Section --</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Sir... the field strength is<br>
    stabilizing...</p>
  <p> Troi comes to the monitor.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Eighteen percent... twenty...<br>
    twenty-five...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I guess they got our message.</p>
  <p> There is palpable relief on the bridge. Ro looks at<br>
    Troi, holds her eyes for a moment, and then, without<br>
    any hint of embarrassment...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I was wrong, Counselor.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You could have just as easily<br>
    been right.</p>

  <p>76 INT. CORRIDOR - ON TURBOLIFT DOORS</p>
  <p> The doors are pried open from the inside and an<br>
    exhausted Picard hauls himself up and into the<br>
    corridor. Marissa, Jay Gordon, and Patterson come up<br>
    after him. Picard leans against the wall... he and<br>
    the children smile at each other for a moment and then<br>
    Marissa carefully gives him a hug. For once, Picard<br>
    is not uncomfortable with the affection of children.</p>
  <p>77 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Worf is still with Keiko. He studies the tricorder<br>
    anxiously.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/15/91 - ACT FIVE 58A.</p>
  <p>77 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Congratulations. You are fully<br>
    dilated to ten centimeters.<br>
    (proudly)<br>
    You may now give birth.</p>
  <p> Keiko just opens her eyes and stares at him.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    I thought that's what I've been<br>
    trying to do...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Bearing down is the next stage.<br>
    It should start at full dilation.<br>
    Why has it not begun?</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    I don't know... I don't think<br>
    it's up to me... it happens when<br>
    it happens...</p>
  <p> This whole thing is distressing to Worf; it isn't<br>
    following the book, and he has no control over what's<br>
    happening.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    My computer simulation was not<br>
    like this. That delivery was<br>
    very orderly.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Well, I'm sorry...</p>
  <p> Another contraction starts and she closes her eyes.<br>
    This time there is an involuntary groan.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (hoping)<br>
    Did you feel an uncontrollable<br>
    urge to push?</p>
  <p> Keiko's eyes open and she nods.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Good! You are bearing down. Now<br>
    you must push with each<br>
    contraction and I must urge you<br>
    gently but firmly to push harder.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/16/91 - ACT FIVE 58B.</p>
  <p>77 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Keiko shuts her eyes again and shakes her head<br>
    slightly. This might go better alone. But another<br>
    contraction...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Push, Keiko. Push hard...</p>
  <p> And Keiko does...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Push... push...</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    (through clenched<br>
    teeth)<br>
    I am pushing --</p>
  <p> The contraction fades. Worf looks pleased.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The baby is emerging head first.<br>
    One more contraction...</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Okay...</p>
  <p> Another contraction... Keiko groans, pushes...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That's good -- push... harder...<br>
    (amazed)<br>
    I have the baby!</p>
  <p> Keiko gasps and sags back.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will now smack the child to<br>
    induce breathing --</p>
  <p> But before he can carry out that step, the baby starts<br>
    crying lustily. Worf, holding the slippery little<br>
    package, smiles broadly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I believe she looks like Chief<br>
    O'Brien.</p>
  <p> He wraps the baby in a blanket and hands her to Keiko,<br>
    who is spent and exhausted but thrilled. She takes<br>
    the bundle, cradles it to her, then looks up at Worf.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/21/91 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>77 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    You were wonderful, Worf. I<br>
    couldn't have done it without<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> He inclines his head modestly.</p>

    Captain's log, supplemental. We<br>
    are en route to Starbase Sixty-seven,<br>
    to undergo repairs. Life<br>
    aboard the Enterprise is slowly<br>

  <p>82 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Troi, Marissa, Jay Gordon, and Patterson ENTER from<br>
    the turbolift and go to Riker, who is in command. Data,<br>
    Worf, and Ro are at their stations. Jay Gordon is<br>
    carrying a plaque. (He is holding it against his<br>
    chest with the lettering facing outward. It has been<br>
    signed by the three children.) Riker stands and smiles<br>
    at Troi as she approaches.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (joking)<br>
    Just can't stay away from the big<br>
    chair anymore, can you?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (right back at him)<br>
    I don't think I'm cut out to be<br>
    captain... first officer,<br>
    maybe... I understand there<br>
    aren't many qualifications.</p>
  <p> Riker takes the shot with grace.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Captain Picard to the bridge,<br>
    please.</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS from the ready room.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There are some visitors here to<br>
    see you, Captain.</p>
  <p> The three children immediately move forward. Picard<br>
    is a little surprised to see them here, but he smiles<br>
    at them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hello. It's good to see you<br>
    again. What brings you to the<br>
    bridge?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Disaster&quot; - REV. 8/21/91 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>82 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Jay and Patterson immediately look to Marissa, who's<br>
    now become the unofficial leader of the group. She's<br>
    still naturally shy and quiet, but now she is able to<br>
    meet Picard's eyes directly and her voice has a<br>
    stronger timbre than before. She reads the plaque<br>
    that Jay Gordon is holding.</p>
  <p> MARISSA<br>
    (reading plaque)<br>
    &quot;In appreciation for the way you<br>
    helped us get out of the<br>
    turboshaft, and the way you<br>
    helped us not be scared.&quot;<br>
    (looking up at Picard)<br>
    We want to present to you this<br>
    com-mem-mor-a-tive plaque.<br>
    (whispers to Jay<br>
    Gordon)<br>
    Give it to him.</p>
  <p> Jay Gordon solemnly moves forward and gravely gives<br>
    Picard the plaque. Picard receives it in the same<br>
    spirit of seriousness in which it is given.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you, very much.</p>
  <p> PATTERSON<br>
    I made the back piece.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And you did a wonderful job.<br>
    Later this afternoon, we'll<br>
    finish the tour I promised you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Starting with the battle bridge.</p>
  <p> Eager smiles and reactions from the children.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll see you at fourteen hundred<br>
    hours.<br>
    (as he turns to go to<br>
    the Ready Room)<br>
    You have the bridge, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER &amp; MARISSA<br>
