    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Travelling at warp speed.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45047.2.<br>
    The Enterprise is en route to an<br>
    uninhabited planet in the El-Adrel<br>
    system. The location is mid-way<br>
    between Federation space and the<br>
    territory occupied by an enigmatic<br>
    race known as &quot;The Children of<br>
    Tama.&quot;</p>
  <p>2 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD, RIKER, TROI, DATA and WORF. The Enterprise is<br>
    at warp. A schematic of a Tamarian spacecraft is<br>
    displayed at Data's end of the table.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Tamarians apparently arrived<br>
    at El-Adrel Four nearly three<br>
    weeks ago. They've been<br>
    transmitting a subspace signal<br>
    toward Federation space ever<br>
    since.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The signal is a standard<br>
    mathematical progression. It does<br>
    not carry a specific message.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But they want us to know they're<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - 7/8/91 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Apparently so. Starfleet<br>
    believes their presence is an<br>
    attempt to start a dialogue.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> Data indicates the graphic display -- the ship is<br>
    formidable looking, covered with alien lettering.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - REV. 7/10/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Federation vessels have<br>
    encountered Tamarian ships seven<br>
    times over the past one hundred<br>
    years. Each meeting was without<br>
    incident, but formal relations<br>
    were never established because<br>
    communication was not possible.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Children of Tama were called<br>
    &quot;incomprehensible&quot; by Captain<br>
    Silvestri of the Shiku Maru.<br>
    Other accounts are comparable.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A cause for concern. For all<br>
    we know, they are threatening<br>
    our border.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Everything in the previous<br>
    encounters suggests a peaceable<br>
    race. We have to start from<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed. I appreciate your<br>
    prudence, Lieutenant Worf. But<br>
    given the evidence, Starfleet has<br>
    arrived at a reasonable<br>
    conclusion. The Tamarians have<br>
    extended a hand -- we must do the<br>
    same.</p>
  <p> A beat as Worf lets it go for now. Riker turns to the<br>
    graphic display.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The &quot;Children of Tama.&quot; I've<br>
    heard rumors about them for years.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As have I, Number One.</p>
  <p> Picard glances at the graphic of the Tamarian ship.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - REV. 7/16/91 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Are they truly &quot;incomprehensible&quot;?<br>
    In my experience, communication<br>
    is a function of patience and<br>
    imagination. I'd like to think<br>
    we have both qualities in<br>
    sufficient measure.</p>
  <p>3 ANGLE ON THE TAMARIAN GRAPHIC</p>
  <p> A beat on the mysterious, powerful-looking vessel.</p>
  <p>4 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise and a Tamarian starship, as formidable<br>
    as the graphic, slightly more robust than our own<br>
    craft. The ships are facing each other, in orbit above<br>
    a reddish planet.</p>
  <p>5 INT. BRIDGE - THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> displays a TAMARIAN -- CAPTAIN DATHON -- flanked by<br>
    his FIRST OFFICER, and TWO OTHER OFFICERS. Their<br>
    uniforms are rich with insignia -- and each wears a<br>
    small ceremonial dagger across his or her chest. But<br>
    all look the very embodiment of &quot;well-meaning.&quot;</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    ... Rai and Jiri at Lungha. Rai<br>
    of Lowani. Lowani under two<br>
    moons. Jiri of Ubaya. Ubaya of<br>
    crossed roads. At Lungha.<br>
    Lungha. Her sky grey.</p>
  <p> He smiles in all friendliness, as if waiting for a<br>
    response.</p>
  <p>6 THE BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Troi, Worf. All are staring at the<br>
    viewscreen, a stupefied expression on each face. Data<br>
    cocks his head in the android equivalent.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - REV. 7/10/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    (continuing;<br>
    re-emphasizing)<br>
    Rai and Jiri. At Lungha...</p>
  <p> A beat. Picard glances at Troi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm picking up nothing but good<br>
    intentions, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Tamarian seems to be stating<br>
    the proper names of individuals<br>
    and locations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But what does it all mean?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am at a loss, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard faces the alien on the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to screen)<br>
    Captain, I invite you to consider<br>
    the creation of a mutual<br>
    non-aggression pact between our<br>
    two peoples. Possibly leading<br>
    to a trade agreement and cultural<br>
    interchange. Does this sound like<br>
    a reasonable course of action?</p>
  <p>7 INCLUDE THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Now it's the Tamarians' turn to stare open-mouthed.<br>
    They haven't a clue...</p>
  <p> The First Officer turns to Captain Dathon.</p>
  <p> FIRST OFFICER<br>
    Kadir beneath Mo Moteh.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - REV. 7/16/91 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The other officers laugh -- but the Captain doesn't<br>
    find it funny.</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    The river Temarc.</p>
  <p> The officers immediately stop their laughter -- as if<br>
    ordered to.</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    (continuing; for<br>
    emphasis)<br>
    In winter.</p>
  <p> His officers look sheepish.</p>
  <p>8 RESUME BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker exchange a glance.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Impressions, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They seem to be trying their best.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As are we. For what it's worth.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (indicating screen)<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker look up at the screen.</p>
  <p>9 THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Where the aliens appear to be having a spirited<br>
    discussion amongst themselves.</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    Darmok.</p>
  <p> The First Officer looks very concerned -- objects.</p>
  <p> FIRST OFFICER<br>
    Darmok? Rai and Jiri at Lungha.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - REV. 7/17/91 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    Shaka. When the walls fell...</p>
  <p> FIRST OFFICER<br>
    Zima at Anzo. Zima and Bakor.</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    (firm)<br>
    Darmok at Tanagra.</p>
  <p> FIRST OFFICER<br>
    Shaka!<br>
    (indicates situation)<br>
    Mirab. His sails unfurled.</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    Darmok.</p>
  <p> FIRST OFFICER<br>
    Mir--</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    --Temarc!</p>
  <p> The First Officer shuts up.</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    The river Temarc...</p>
  <p> The First Officer bows his head in complete compliance<br>
    -- he's lost the argument.</p>
  <p> Captain Dathon reaches out and takes the First<br>
    Officer's ceremonial DAGGER.</p>
  <p>10 INCLUDE BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard watches as the alien captain turns to him -- now<br>
    armed with two daggers.</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.</p>
  <p> A beat. Suddenly both Picard and the Tamarian Captain<br>
    DEMATERIALIZE in a transporter beam.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Block their transporter with the<br>
    shields! Extend to maximum range!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - REV. 7/16/91 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard completely disappears as Worf hits his console.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Not enough time!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Where is he?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off instruments)<br>
    The Tamarians have transported<br>
    Captain Picard to the surface.<br>
    With their own captain...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (touches insignia)<br>
    Riker to O'Brien --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    -- Transport will not be possible,<br>
    Commander. The Tamarian ship has<br>
    created a particle scattering<br>
    field in the planet's ionosphere.</p>
  <p> Riker looks at the viewscreen -- which goes back to an<br>
    image of the Tamarian ship.</p>
  <p>11 EXT. PLANET</p>
  <p> A desert filled with scrub-brush and rock. Picard and<br>
    the Tamarian Captain are facing each other, separated<br>
    by thirty feet of bare ground. Two daggers are in the<br>
    alien's hands.</p>
  <p> OFF Picard's expression: &quot;What the hell is this all<br>
    about?&quot;</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - REV. 7/10/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>12 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> and the Tamarian ship, facing each other in orbit above<br>
    the planet.</p>
  <p>13 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker, Data, Troi, Worf.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Riker to Captain Picard...<br>
    (no response)<br>
    Captain, do you read me?</p>
  <p> Riker turns to Data.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Can we compensate?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off instruments)<br>
    No, sir. The Tamarians are<br>
    projecting a particle sustaining<br>
    beam into the upper atmosphere.<br>
    The result is a hyperionization<br>
    that disrupts virtually all EM<br>
    and subspace carriers.</p>
  <p> Riker thinks for a moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That means they can't communicate<br>
    with their man, either. Or beam<br>
    anybody through the field.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct. However, they<br>
    have left sensor frequencies<br>
    clear.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So they can read what's going on?<br>
    Analysis, Mister Worf. What the<br>
    hell is going on?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - REV. 7/17/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    A contest, perhaps.<br>
    (in explanation)<br>
    Between champions. Our captain<br>
    against theirs.</p>
  <p> Riker considers this for a moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (remembering)<br>
    Theirs was armed...</p>
  <p> OFF everyone's reaction.</p>
  <p>14 EXT. PLANET - CLEARING - DAY</p>
  <p> Picard and the alien captain are still thirty feet<br>
    apart, facing each other.</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    Darmok and Jalad.</p>
  <p> The Tamarian extends the dagger-like weapon he took<br>
    from his first officer, as if offering it to Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (re: the weapon)<br>
    You expect me to fight -- is that<br>
    it? A challenge?</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    Darmok and Jalad.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know who or what Darmok<br>
    and Jalad are. But I didn't come<br>
    here to start a war.</p>
  <p> Picard makes no move to accept the weapon.</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    (insistent)<br>
    Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I refuse.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - REV. 7/16/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard crosses his arms. The Tamarian stares for a<br>
    beat, then tosses the weapon toward Picard, landing it<br>
    a couple of feet away from him. Picard doesn't even<br>
    look at it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Would you attack an unarmed man,<br>
    Captain? There's not much of a<br>
    challenge in that.</p>
  <p> The alien watches him for a moment. Scowls. The<br>
    Tamarian takes his own weapon out of its chest sheath,<br>
    points at the one in front of Picard.</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    Temba. His arms wide.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (shakes head)<br>
    I'm sorry, Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard picks up the weapon, tosses it back in front of<br>
    the alien.</p>
  <p> They stare at each other for a few beats. The<br>
    Tamarian looks frustrated. He reaches down, picks up<br>
    the dagger.</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    (almost to himself)<br>
    Shaka... When the walls fell...</p>
  <p> He moves slowly off toward the edge of the clearing,<br>
    keeping an eye on Picard all the way. Picard does the<br>
    same, moving toward the opposite end of the clearing.</p>
  <p> The Tamarian now ignores Picard completely and starts<br>
    clearing out rocks to form a campground. Picard<br>
    watches for a few beats. Then starts to do the same.</p>
  <p>15 INT. BRIDGE - SCIENCE STATION</p>
  <p> Data looks up from his instruments. Riker is standing<br>
    behind him, waiting for Data's report.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - REV. 7/17/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sensors show the captain and the<br>
    Tamarian in apparent good health,<br>
    approximately twenty meters from<br>
    each other.</p>
  <p> Everyone considers Data's words. A beat as Riker<br>
    thinks for a moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Worf, close the channel.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Gladly, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf touches the console and the viewscreen switches to<br>
    the image of the Tamarian ship.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    I want you and a security team<br>
    to take a shuttle down to the<br>
    planet. Bring back the captain.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, Commander.</p>
  <p> Worf heads for the turbolift.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, the Tamarians are fully<br>
    capable of stopping a shuttle.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm aware of that. But disrupting<br>
    our transporter beam is one thing.<br>
    Firing on a shuttle is something<br>
    else entirely. I'm betting<br>
    they're not gonna push it that<br>
    far.</p>

  <p>17 EXT. PLANET - CLEARING - NIGHT</p>
  <p>18 CLOSE ON A STICK</p>
  <p> being twirled by Picard's hands. As a slight tendril<br>
    of smoke rises off a small pile of straw...</p>
  <p>19 REVEAL PICARD</p>
  <p> working the stick. He quickly drops it, blows on the<br>
    straw, adding more material, until he has a small fire<br>
    going... which quickly sputters out.</p>
  <p> Picard scowls, looks over across the clearing.</p>
  <p>20 THE TAMARIAN</p>
  <p> is staring back at him, sitting next to a roaring<br>
    campfire. He smiles at Picard's failed attempt.</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    Shaka. When the walls fell.</p>
  <p>21 INCLUDE PICARD</p>
  <p> not pleased with the situation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    &quot;Shaka&quot; indeed.</p>
  <p> Picard stands, giving up on the fire.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What now, Captain? Will you<br>
    attack me in my sleep?</p>
  <p> Picard rubs his arms against the growing chill.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (exaggerating)<br>
    If I don't freeze to death<br>
    first...</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>

  <p> Picard thinks a moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - 7/8/91 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard of the Federation.</p>
  <p> The Tamarian looks at him blankly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Of the starship Enterprise... Of<br>
    the planet Earth...</p>
  <p> Picard's words mean nothing to the alien.</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    Kadir beneath Mo Moteh...</p>
  <p> The Tamarian shrugs, turns away, ignoring Picard. He<br>
    adds some wood to his fire, then crouches on his<br>
    haunches like a Bedouin. He takes five ornamental<br>
    objects off of his garments, carefully placing them on<br>
    the ground.</p>
  <p>22 THE TAMARIAN</p>
  <p> begins a strange ritual, alternately picking up one or<br>
    more of the objects and dropping them on the ground,<br>
    touching his forehead after each pattern formed by<br>
    their fall. His manner is not particularly religious<br>
    -- more like habit or custom done without much thought.</p>
  <p>23 PICARD</p>
  <p> watches with curiosity. He rubs his arms unconsciously<br>
    against the chill.</p>
  <p>24 THE SCENE</p>
  <p> The alien finishes his ritual, leaving the objects on<br>
    the ground. He glances over at Picard -- who is<br>
    walking back and forth, keeping his blood going. The<br>
    Tamarian turns from him, laying down in front of the<br>
    fire.</p>
  <p>25 THE TAMARIAN</p>
  <p> closes his eyes, attempting to sleep. A couple of<br>
    beats later, his eyes open. He rolls over, looks back<br>
    at Picard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - REV. 7/16/91 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>26 THE TAMARIAN'S POV</p>
  <p> Picard isn't life-threatened by the cold -- but he<br>
    looks increasingly uncomfortable. It's going to be a<br>
    miserable night.</p>
  <p>27 RESUME THE TAMARIAN</p>
  <p> He sighs -- with a hint of guilt. The alien sits up,<br>
    pokes around the fire until he pulls out a branch<br>
    burning at one end only.</p>
  <p>28 THE SCENE</p>
  <p> The Tamarian stands with the flame-tipped wood, and<br>
    in one smooth motion, hurls it end over end across the<br>
    clearing -- where it lands at Picard's feet.</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    Temba.</p>
  <p> Picard looks down at the branch, then back up at the<br>
    Tamarian, who is watching him. Picard picks it up.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Temba? What do you mean? Fire?<br>
    Temba means fire?</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    Temba. His arms wide.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Temba is a person? His arms are<br>
    wide. Because he's holding<br>
    them apart? In generosity?<br>
    In giving? In taking?</p>
  <p> Dathon indicates the branch.</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    Temba. His arms wide.</p>
  <p> Picard gives up on the specific meaning for now. The<br>
    gift is progress in any case.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you.<br>
    (indicates branch)<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - 7/8/91 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>29 PICARD</p>
  <p> holds the brand to his pile of straw and it immediately<br>
    ignites. He adds kindling and branches and quickly has<br>
    a cheery fire. He looks back toward the alien.</p>
  <p>30 PICARD'S POV</p>
  <p> The Tamarian appears to be fast asleep.</p>
  <p>31 RESUME PICARD</p>
  <p> as he watches the alien for a few moments. OFF the<br>
    thoughtful look on his face.</p>

    First Officer's log, supplemental.<br>
    I am sending a shuttlecraft to<br>
    find Captain Picard, gambling that<br>
    the Tamarians will back down<br>
    rather than risk an exchange of<br>
    phaser fire. But I feel like I'm<br>
    playing a deadly game -- the<br>
    captain's life is the prize, and<br>
    I still don't know the rules.</p>

  <p> Riker, Data, Troi, GEORDI, Worf.</p>
  <p> Geordi is indicating a graphic display of the planet's<br>
    upper atmosphere -- a glowing umbrella effect indicates<br>
    the spread of the Tamarian scattering field. Graphic<br>
    representations of the Enterprise and the Tamarian ship<br>
    are in orbit above it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm pretty sure I can punch up<br>
    the annular confinement beam --<br>
    enough to transport the captain<br>
    through the field. But it's gonna<br>
    take a full day at least.</p>

    Captain Picard could be dead by<br>

    I have confidence in his ability<br>
    as a warrior. He will be<br>
    victorious.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're still assuming this is some<br>
    sort of a challenge ritual. We<br>
    can't be certain of that.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Agreed. We're making educated<br>
    guesses about their motivations<br>
    -- no more than that.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - REV. 7/10/91 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Then why do we wait? If we attack<br>
    the ship directly, they will be<br>
    unable to maintain the scattering<br>
    field.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Which could start a shooting<br>
    match, and for all we know, a war.<br>
    And we still might not be able<br>
    to save the captain.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It will end this stalemate.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There's too much at risk. I'll<br>
    take that course when it's the<br>
    only one left.</p>
  <p> A silent beat as Riker looks around the room, the<br>
    frustration obvious in his voice.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Who the hell are these people?<br>
    There's got to be some way to get<br>
    through to them.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    As I have said, with further study<br>
    it may be possible to --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    -- Then do it.<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Deanna, help him. I want<br>
    something by oh-nine hundred<br>
    hours.</p>
  <p> The meeting's over. Riker gets up and leaves, Worf and<br>
    Geordi follow him out.</p>
  <p> OFF a glance between Data and Troi -- they've got a<br>
    daunting task in front of them.</p>
  <p>48 EXT. PLANET - CLEARING - DAY</p>
  <p> Picard is curled up asleep by the now burned-out<br>
    campfire. He takes a ragged breath, his eyes open.<br>
    Picard sits up, takes in his surroundings, glances<br>
    across the clearing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - 7/8/91 - ACT TWO 22A.</p>
  <p>49 PICARD'S POV</p>
  <p> The alien's campsite is empty -- the Tamarian is<br>
    nowhere to be seen.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - 7/8/91 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>50 RESUME</p>
  <p> Picard stands, dusting himself off, still looking<br>
    across the clearing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    Where have you gone to, my friend?</p>
  <p> Picard stares for another beat, glances around, doesn't<br>
    see anybody, and makes a decision.</p>
  <p> He strides away from his campsite, crosses the<br>
    clearing, looking around at each step for the alien.</p>
  <p> Picard arrives at the campsite, pausing at the rocks<br>
    that have been piled around it. Still no sign of the<br>
    Tamarian. Picard looks at the campsite -- several<br>
    personal objects appear to have been left. He can't<br>
    resist.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    Forgive the intrusion, Captain.<br>
    But I need some answers.</p>
  <p> Picard steps over the rock perimeter. He moves to the<br>
    burned out campfire and crouches down.</p>
  <p>51 CLOSE ON THE CEREMONIAL OBJECTS</p>
  <p> Two of the small pieces the Tamarian worked the ritual<br>
    with the previous night. Picard's hand reaches down<br>
    and picks one of them up.</p>
  <p>52 RESUME</p>
  <p> Picard turns it over in his hand, studying it. The<br>
    object is metallic and crystalline, dull like lead<br>
    rather than shining, but has a beauty nonetheless.</p>
  <p> He puts it down. Something catches his eye a few feet<br>
    away...</p>

  <p> Picard is still standing ALONE in the alien's campsite.<br>
    In his hands is the book, and he is pouring through<br>
    it with great interest.</p>
  <p>55 CLOSE ON THE BOOK</p>
  <p> A thin notebook of high-tech material. On its pages is<br>
    a jumble of Tamarian writing, reminiscent of the<br>
    lettering on the Tamarian ship. Picard's fingers<br>
    carefully, respectfully turn the pages. The last entry<br>
    ends in the middle of the page.</p>

    --Enough! I'm not going to<br>
    fight you. You'll just have to---</p>
  <p> A TREMENDOUS ANIMAL ROAR sounds offscreen. Picard<br>
    whips around at the noise. The Tamarian is not<br>
    surprised -- this is what he's been agitated about.</p>

    That's not good enough. I want<br>
    to be able to knock out the<br>

    have the captain back on the<br>
    Enterprise before they know what<br>
    happened.</p>

    If we selectively target the<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    How long to set that up?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Worf and I will have to adjust<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Geordi and Worf stand and leave the room. Riker turns<br>
    to Troi and Data.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: Worf and Geordi)<br>
    I'd prefer to find a peaceful<br>
    solution. If we can talk our way<br>
    out of this -- so much the better.</p>
  <p> Troi and Data exchange a glance.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Unfortunately, it's not that<br>
    simple.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What have you found?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Tamarian ego structure does<br>
    not seem to allow what we normally<br>
    think of as self-identity. Their<br>
    ability to abstract is highly<br>
    unusual. They seem to<br>
    communicate through narrative<br>
    imagery -- by reference to the<br>
    individuals and places which<br>
    appear in their mytho-historical<br>
    accounts.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's as if I were to say to you<br>
    &quot;Juliet. On her balcony.&quot;</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    An image of romance.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Exactly. Image is everything to<br>
    the Tamarians.<br>
    (MORE)</p>

  <p>93 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI (cont'd)<br>
    It embodies their emotional<br>
    states, their very thought<br>
    processes. It's how they<br>
    communicate, and how they think.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If we know how they think, can't<br>
    we get something across to them?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No sir. The situation is<br>
    analogous to understanding the<br>
    grammar of a language but none<br>
    of the vocabulary.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    If I didn't know who Juliet was<br>
    or what she was doing on that<br>
    balcony, the image alone wouldn't<br>
    mean anything.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's correct. We know, for<br>
    instance, that &quot;Darmok&quot; was a<br>
    great hero -- a hunter. Tanagra<br>
    was an island. But that's all.<br>
    Without the details, there's no<br>
    understanding.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is necessary for us to learn<br>
    the narratives from which the<br>
    Tamarians are drawing these<br>
    images.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Given our current relations, that<br>
    does not appear likely.</p>
  <p> OFF Riker's reaction -- they're at a dead end.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Our situation is similar to<br>
    theirs. I understand. But I need<br>

    mean give?<br>
    (pointing to Dathon)<br>
    Temba. His arms wide. Darmok.<br>
    Give me more about Darmok.</p>
  <p> Picard makes a &quot;give me&quot; or &quot;come on&quot; motion with his<br>
    hand. Dathon smiles to hear Picard's efforts in his<br>
    own language. But he understands.</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    Darmok on the ocean.</p>
  <p> Picard thinks out loud, trying to understand. (NOTE:<br>
    the alien does not understand Picard's &quot;English&quot; --<br>
    only when Picard repeats a Tamarian phrase or image<br>
    will Dathon show a glimmer of recognition.)</p>

    A metaphor. For being alone?<br>

  <p> DATHON<br>
    On the ocean--</p>

    Picard again moves toward him, this time the Tamarian<br>
    is angered.</p>
  <p> DATHON<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Zinda! His face black... His eyes<br>

  <p> Picard stares at him for a moment.</p>

    You hoped this would happen,<br>
    didn't you? You knew there was<br>
    a dangerous creature on this<br>

    together.<br>
    (indicating situation)<br>
    Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.<br>
    You and me, here -- at El-Adrel.</p>
  <p> The Tamarian gives a confirmatory shake of his<br>
    shoulders. Then fights another wave of pain. When it<br>
    passes, he takes a ragged breath. Then appears to be<br>
    waiting for something. He gives a &quot;go-ahead&quot;<br>
    indication to Picard.</p>

    of a story teller. And you<br>
    wouldn't understand me anyway.<br>
    (shakes head)<br>
    Shaka... when the walls fell.</p>
  <p> The Tamarian smiles -- but is disappointed. Picard<br>
    picks up on it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Perhaps that doesn't matter. You<br>
    want to hear it anyway...</p>
  <p> The Tamarian is waiting... Picard thinks for a moment,<br>

    There is a story... A very ancient<br>
    one. From Earth. I'll try to<br>
    remember...</p>
  <p> He attempts to match the Tamarian's &quot;story-telling&quot;<br>
    voice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Gilgamesh. Was a king. At Uruk.<br>
    He tormented his subjects. He<br>
    drove them to anger. They cried<br>
    out -- &quot;Give our king a companion.<br>
    Spare us his madness.&quot;</p>
  <p> Picard glances at the Tamarian -- the alien's eyes are<br>
    glazed, but rapt.</p>

    Enkidu. They became friends.<br>
    (beat)<br>

  <p> DATHON<br>

    (quiet)<br>
    The new friends went into the<br>
    desert, where the Great Bull of<br>

    Tamarian shudders once -- and is completely still.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> FIRST OFFICER<br>
    (to others; amazed)<br>
    Sokath! His eyes open!</p>
  <p> The aliens stare at him, all ears -- awaiting news of<br>
    what happened on the planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The beast at Tanagra. Uzani.<br>
    His army.<br>
    (shaking his head)<br>
    Shaka. When the walls fell.</p>
  <p> The aliens appear saddened. They lower their eyes.<br>
    Each Tamarian ritualistically touches his dagger, then<br>
    his forehead.</p>
  <p> The aliens again face Picard. Picard takes the small<br>
    book -- the Tamarian captain's &quot;diary&quot; -- and holds<br>
    it out in his hand.</p>
  <p> The Tamarian First Officer glances at one of his<br>
    officers, who touches a console. The book is<br>
    immediately DEMATERIALIZED, MATERIALIZING next to the<br>
    alien First Officer. He picks it up, showing it to<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> FIRST OFFICER<br>
    (re: book)<br>
    Picard and Dathon at El-Adrel.</p>
  <p> Picard nods. The alien sets the book down. Turns back<br>
    to Picard.</p>
  <p> FIRST OFFICER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Mirab. With sails unfurled.</p>
  <p> Picard extends the Tamarian dagger toward the First<br>
    Officer, offering it back to him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Temba. His arms open.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - REV. 7/16/91 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>114 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> The alien makes a motion with his hands -- as if<br>
    declining Picard's offer of the weapon.</p>
  <p> FIRST OFFICER<br>
    Temba at rest.</p>
  <p> Picard nods, lowers the dagger.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (almost to himself)<br>
    Thank you...</p>
  <p> The viewscreen goes to a shot of the Tamarian ship,<br>
    as it turns and moves off.</p>
  <p> A beat. Riker and the others are taken aback by<br>
    Picard's performance.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: Tamarians)<br>
    New friends, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can't say, Number One.</p>
  <p> Picard glances at the dagger.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But at least they're not new<br>
    enemies.</p>
  <p>115 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Cruising at warp.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - REV. 7/17/91 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>116 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard is at his terminal, engrossed. The door<br>
    chimes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS, carrying a PADD.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I hope I'm not intruding, Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard, in fact, is in an introspective and thoughtful<br>
    mood. He doesn't look up.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not at all, Number One. Please.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Damage reports are ready for your<br>
    review.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Riker steps over, places the PADD on the desk, and<br>
    glances at the captain's viewscreen.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Greek, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Homeric Hymns.<br>
    (glances up)<br>
    One of the root metaphors of our<br>
    own culture.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    For the next time we encounter<br>
    the Tamarians...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    More familiarity with our own<br>
    mythology might help us relate<br>
    to theirs.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Darmok&quot; - REV. 7/17/91 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>116 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard sits in silent thought for a moment -- as if<br>
    this subject has been greatly occupying his mind. He<br>
    pushes away from the terminal, stands.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Tamarian was willing to risk<br>
    all of us -- just for the hope<br>
    of communication, of connection.<br>
    And now the door's open between<br>
    our peoples. That commitment<br>
    meant more to him than his own<br>
    life.</p>
  <p> A long beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Would I do the same... ?</p>
  <p> Picard glances away -- Riker is silently dismissed.<br>
    He turns and leaves the room. The door shuts behind<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> Picard looks down at his desk -- and the Tamarian<br>
    dagger laying on top of it. Picard touches it, then<br>
    brings his hand up to his forehead in the Tamarian<br>
    ritual honoring.</p>
  <p> He lowers his hand. OFF his face.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
