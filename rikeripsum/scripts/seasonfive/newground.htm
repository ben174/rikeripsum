    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is entering orbit around a planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45376.3.<br>
    We are approaching the planet<br>
    Bilana Three, where a new method<br>
    of propulsion known as the Soliton<br>
    Wave is being developed. The<br>
    Enterprise has been asked to<br>
    participate in one of the first<br>
    tests of this new technology.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> GEORDI is working at a monitor in his office. He<br>
    crosses to the pool table, where WORF and DATA are<br>
    working. Geordi is very up, very excited. Data and<br>
    Worf are their usual stoic selves.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    We're going to witness a moment<br>
    in history, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    Every nanosecond in this<br>
    continuum becomes a moment in<br>
    history once it has elapsed.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No, no. I mean we're going to<br>
    see something that people will<br>
    talk about for years.</p>
  <p> Data nods in understanding and then returns to work.<br>
    Geordi turns to Worf, determined to impress upon him<br>
    the importance of what they're doing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - 10/4/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Think about it... no more bulky<br>
    warp engines or nacelles... a<br>
    ship just generates a Soliton<br>
    Wave... and then rides it through<br>
    space like a surfboard.</p>
  <p> Worf makes a noncommittal grunt of acknowledgement.<br>
    Geordi makes one last attempt.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    This is going to be like being<br>
    there to watch Chuck Yeager break<br>
    the sound barrier, or Zephram<br>
    Cochrane engage the first warp<br>
    drive!</p>
  <p> Worf and Data look at Geordi for a beat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It should be interesting.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (flat)<br>
    Very exciting.</p>
  <p> Geordi looks at them helplessly. Nothing is going to<br>
    excite these two.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm talking to the wrong crowd.<br>
    (sees another crewman<br>
    and walks away)<br>
    Donaldson! Hey, Donaldson, can<br>
    you believe that we're actually<br>
    going to be there when they...</p>
  <p> As Geordi moves to talk with Donaldson...</p>
  <p> VOICE<br>
    Lieutenant Worf, you have a<br>
    subspace communication from the<br>
    transport ship Milan.</p>
  <p>3 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As Worf moves to a monitor and touches a button.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - REV. 10/9/91 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Transfer the signal to this<br>
    station.</p>
  <p> The image of HELENA ROZHENKO fills the screen.</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    (smiles warmly)<br>
    Hello, Worf.</p>
  <p> Worf is surprised, but pleased to see his mother.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Mother?</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    I hope you don't mind us dropping<br>
    in on you like this, but when I<br>
    heard the Enterprise was going<br>
    to be in this sector, we took the<br>
    first transport... and here we<br>
    are.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Is father with you?</p>
  <p> A brief beat of discomfort crosses Helena's face, but<br>
    she covers it quickly and tries to sound happy and<br>
    normal.</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    No. I brought Alexander with me.<br>
    I thought the two of you might<br>
    like a chance to... visit.</p>
  <p> Worf knows there's something going on here... he is<br>
    quiet for a moment, but doesn't want to press his<br>
    mother just now.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Very well. I will make<br>
    arrangements for you to come<br>
    aboard.</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    (pleased)<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - 10/4/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN is behind the console. Worf<br>
    is waiting by the platform. Helena and ALEXANDER<br>
    MATERIALIZE on the platform. Helena gives Worf a big<br>
    hug.</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    It's good to see you, Worf.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You look wonderful. Is that<br>
    a touch of gray in your beard?</p>
  <p> Worf instinctively puts a hand to his chin.</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    (proudly)<br>
    Don't worry, the Rozhenko men have<br>
    always had beards of iron-gray.</p>
  <p> Alexander has stayed behind on the transporter platform<br>
    and now Helena and Worf both turn their attention to<br>
    him. Alexander is simply staring at Worf... a little<br>
    scared and a little curious. Worf is happy to see his<br>
    son again.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (warm)<br>
    Hello, Alexander.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Hello.</p>
  <p> Worf extends a hand and Alexander shakes it after a<br>
    beat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is good to see you both. How<br>
    long can you stay?</p>
  <p> That's not a question Helena wanted to answer right<br>
    now, but Alexander speaks right up as if the answer<br>
    should be obvious.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - 10/4/91 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I'm not going back.</p>
  <p> Worf looks to Helena, who looks guilty. On Worf's<br>
    reaction...</p>

  <p> END OF TEASER </p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>5 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Worf and Helena ENTER. They head for a private table<br>
    near one of the windows.</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    Did you see Alexander's face when<br>
    he saw the play area? He's going<br>
    to love it here.</p>
  <p> That brings up a subject Worf would like to talk about.<br>
    They sit.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Mother, why does Alexander believe<br>
    he is remaining... ?</p>
  <p> Worf trails off as a WAITER comes over to the table to<br>
    take their order.</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    (to waiter)<br>
    Lapsang suchong tea, please.</p>
  <p> The waiter looks at Worf, but he shakes his head no.</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    Have you been eating? You look<br>
    thin.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Mother...</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    When your father was in Starfleet,<br>
    I always had to make sure that---</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (gentle but firm)<br>
    Mother. We need to talk about<br>
    Alexander.</p>
  <p> Helena knows he's right. She reluctantly nods her head<br>
    as the Waiter returns and gives her the tea. Helena<br>
    sips some of the tea and pauses for a moment. She has<br>
    some difficult things to say to Worf and it's not going<br>
    to be easy for her. Worf waits respectfully for his<br>
    mother to lead the conversation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - 10/4/91 - ACT ONE 6A.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    Alexander's a fine boy, Worf.<br>
    Smart... high-spirited... a lot<br>
    like you at that age.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    In fact, sometimes he comes<br>
    running through the house and<br>
    knocks over that big green lamp,<br>
    just like you used to do.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I don't recall you smiling when<br>
    I knocked over that lamp.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - REV. 10/9/91 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    Well... maybe once when you<br>
    weren't looking.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    When we learned that Alexander<br>
    was coming to live with us, we<br>
    were very happy. The house had<br>
    been... empty since you left.<br>
    We thought, here is our chance<br>
    to fill it with the sounds of<br>
    children again.</p>
  <p> Helena pauses. She looks at Worf and her tone becomes<br>
    more confidential...</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    But... the truth is... your father<br>
    and I are getting old, Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (protesting)<br>
    Mother, you both still have many<br>
    years---</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I don't mean we're ready for the<br>
    grave... not yet, anyway.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But we are a little... less<br>
    active. It's hard for us to keep<br>
    up with Alexander. We're ready<br>
    to be... just grandparents.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Alexander needs to be with his<br>
    father.</p>
  <p> Worf's tone is regretful, but firm.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That is not possible. We will<br>
    have to find another option.</p>
  <p> Helena considers Worf for a moment. She had hoped it<br>
    wouldn't be necessary to get into this, but Worf isn't<br>
    responding yet.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - REV. 10/9/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    He needs his father, Worf.<br>
    Alexander's having...<br>
    difficulties.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Difficulties?</p>
  <p> This is hard for Helena, they're talking about her<br>
    grandson, after all. But these things must be said.</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    He is... disobedient.</p>
  <p> Worf's natural instinct is to rise to his son's<br>
    defense.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Klingon children are often...<br>
    difficult to control...</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    (wry)<br>
    I do know something about how<br>
    Klingon children behave.</p>
  <p> Worf looks immediately abashed.</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    But it's more than his willful<br>
    attitude. He... does not always<br>
    tell the truth.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    My son is... a liar?</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    (firm)<br>
    He is a boy. And boys can<br>
    sometimes take the wrong path.<br>
    They must have guidance.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Alexander needs a father -- his<br>
    father to give him that guidance.</p>
  <p> Worf is too shocked by this revelation about Alexander<br>
    to argue any further. Helena considers Worf for a few<br>
    moments then reluctantly ends the discussion.</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    I have to go. The transport will<br>
    be returning to Earth shortly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - 10/4/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Helena puts her arm around Worf.</p>
  <p> HELENA<br>
    Do what you believe is best for<br>
    him, Worf. That's all that any<br>
    parent can hope to do.</p>
  <p> A moment between mother and son. Worf still isn't sure<br>
    what to do... but he accepts his mother's words. As<br>
    they rise and head for the exit...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>6 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> In orbit around Bilana Three.</p>
  <p>6A INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> As they walk down the corridor, Worf tries to talk to<br>
    Alexander in the easy, casual way he imagines other<br>
    fathers do with their sons. Alexander's responses are<br>
    not very engaging.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Did you enjoy going to school on<br>
    Earth?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Did you like your teachers?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - REV. 10/8/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>6A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> Another beat of silence as Worf searches for another<br>
    topic.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I understand that you lived in<br>
    my old room.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Uh-huh.</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> An awkward silence follows as Worf discovers that they<br>
    don't have much to say to one another. They continue<br>
    to walk for a few beats... Worf is grateful when they<br>
    finally come to the door of the teacher's office. He<br>
    presses the panel outside the door.</p>
  <p>6B INT. TEACHER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> A small, comfortable office decorated with children's<br>
    drawings, toys, and games. The door CHIMES and MS.<br>
    KYLE looks up from her desk. She is a caring and warm<br>
    woman, yet her voice carries a ring of authority that<br>
    unruly children would be unwise to challenge.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> Worf and Alexander ENTER. Kyle stands and smiles.<br>
    She moves to them and tries to immediately make them<br>
    both comfortable.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Lieutenant Worf, it's good to see<br>
    you again.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - REV. 10/8/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>6B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KYLE (cont'd)<br>
    (to Alexander)<br>
    And you must be Alexander. I hear<br>
    you'll be coming to school with<br>
    us for a while?</p>
  <p> Alexander isn't responding to Kyle's friendly<br>
    attitude. He simply nods in response to her question<br>
    and his attention wanders around the room.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    (to Alexander)<br>
    Well, we're very excited to have<br>
    you with us... I know the other<br>
    boys and girls will be happy to<br>
    have a new classmate.</p>
  <p> No response from Alexander. Kyle isn't fazed by his<br>
    attitude and she moves back to her desk as Worf and<br>
    Alexander sit in two nearby chairs. Kyle begins to<br>
    work the terminal on the desk.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    First, I need to get a little<br>
    information from you. Let's start<br>
    with...<br>
    (pretends to think)<br>
    ... your name.<br>
    (works terminal)<br>
    Alexander Rozhenko... hmmmm...<br>
    that's a tough one... maybe you<br>
    can help me. Can you spell your<br>
    last name for me?</p>
  <p> Alexander gives no indication that he's even heard the<br>
    question.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (prompting)<br>
    Alexander...</p>
  <p> Alexander looks up.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (firmer)<br>
    The teacher asked you a question.</p>
  <p> Kyle doesn't want to spark a confrontation and she<br>
    easily dismisses the issue.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - REV. 10/9/91 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>6B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    It doesn't matter. I think I can<br>
    figure it out.<br>
    (works terminal, then<br>
    to Worf)<br>
    Date of birth?</p>
  <p> Worf thinks for a beat... but he doesn't know the<br>
    answer. Alexander and the teacher both look at him...<br>
    there is a very awkward and embarassing moment as<br>
    everyone finally realizes that Worf doesn't even know<br>
    his own son's birthday. Alexander finally supplies<br>
    the information.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    (hurt, to Worf)<br>
    The forty-third day of Maktag,<br>
    stardate 43205.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes... of course.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    (quickly moving on)<br>
    I'll get the rest of his personal<br>
    records from the school on Earth.<br>
    One last question... how long will<br>
    he be staying aboard ship?</p>
  <p> Another uncomfortable question for Worf. This time<br>
    he's the only one who can supply the answer. Alexander<br>
    looks at his father in surprise... he thought he was<br>
    staying. After a long beat...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It has... not been decided.</p>
  <p> Hold on the hurt look on Alexander's face and Worf's<br>
    reaction...</p>
  <p>6C INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard is sitting at his desk looking over a PADD in<br>
    mild irritation. He sets it down... looks at the<br>
    door... nothing happens... he picks up the PADD again.<br>
    Finally the door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>

  <p>6C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> A somewhat harried Worf ENTERS. Picard fixes him with<br>
    a withering look.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I thought our meeting was at<br>
    eleven hundred hours, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I apologize for being late,<br>
    Captain. I was detained in...<br>
    school.<br>
    (off Picard's look)<br>
    I was enrolling my... son in<br>
    class.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see.<br>
    (beat, then back to<br>
    business)<br>
    Several officers will be<br>
    transferring aboard next week<br>
    and I'd like to discuss making<br>
    a few personnel changes---</p>
  <p> KYLE'S COM VOICE<br>
    Kyle to Lieutenant Worf.</p>
  <p> Worf is very uncomfortable. Picard's face is carefully<br>
    neutral.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Com)<br>
    Worf here.</p>
  <p> KYLE'S COM VOICE<br>
    I'm sorry to bother you again,<br>
    Lieutenant, but I forgot to<br>
    mention that we need to arrange<br>
    for a series of placement<br>
    examinations for Alexander. If<br>
    you could tell me when---</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (curt)<br>
    This is not a good time. I will<br>
    contact you shortly, Ms. Kyle.<br>
    Worf out.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Sorry, Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard gives no reaction and smoothly picks up where<br>
    he left off.</p>

    Personnel changes. I'd like you<br>
    to consider transferring Ensign<br>
    Rocha to phaser control and<br>
    promoting Lieutenant---</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Sickbay to Worf.</p>
  <p> Worf is really embarassed... Picard's silence speaks<br>
    volumes.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Yes, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    I need to schedule a physical<br>
    examination for Alexander. I<br>
    also need his complete medical<br>
    records from Earth and---</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Doctor, I would rather discuss<br>
    this at a later time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (holds up a hand)<br>
    Mister Worf.<br>
    (gently, with a hint<br>
    of humor)<br>
    You are not the first officer on<br>
    this ship to have a new family<br>
    member. Take care of your son.<br>
    The personnel changes can wait.</p>
  <p> Worf is still a little embarassed, but he's grateful<br>
    for the reprieve.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (stands)<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf EXITS. Picard watches him leave and then smiles<br>

  <p>7A INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD, RIKER, Geordi, Data, and Worf are listening<br>
    to DOCTOR JA'DAR. Dr. Ja'Dar is a middle-aged,<br>
    humanoid alien who appears totally consumed by his<br>
    work. Ja'Dar is pointing to the wall monitor upon<br>
    which is a diagram of a SPACECRAFT in orbit around a<br>
    PLANET.</p>

    Twenty-three field coils, working<br>
    in concert, will generate the<br>

  <p> Ja'Dar presses a button on the console.</p>

  <p> The SOLITON WAVE rises up from the planet and heads<br>

    small arcs tightly moving in a straight line.)</p>
  <p> JA'DAR (o.c.)<br>
    (over above action)<br>
    We will have the test ship towed<br>
    to a position approximately two<br>

  <p> JA'DAR<br>
    If our theories are correct, the<br>
    wave will envelop the ship and<br>
    push it into warp.</p>

    Doctor Ja'Dar, how closely will<br>
    the Enterprise need to follow the<br>
    test vehicle?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - REV. 10/9/91 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JA'DAR<br>
    The soliton emits a great deal<br>
    of subspace radio interference.<br>
    You'll need to be within twenty<br>
    kilometers in order to receive<br>
    telemetry.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How will you end the experiment?</p>
  <p> JA'DAR<br>
    The wave will be directed toward<br>
    Lemma Two, about three light years<br>
    distance. We have a sister<br>
    facility there which will<br>
    generate a scattering field to<br>
    dissipate the wave, and bring the<br>
    ship out of warp.</p>
  <p> Ja'Dar turns OFF the monitor and turns back to them.</p>
  <p> JA'DAR<br>
    I'll have more detailed<br>
    operational plans sent to you<br>
    within the hour.</p>
  <p> Everyone seems comfortable with the mission.</p>

    Worf... I was just talking with<br>
    Ms. Kyle from the primary school.<br>
    She told me that you enrolled<br>
    Alexander in her class this<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - 10/4/91 - ACT ONE 16.</p>

  <p> Worf is a little embarrassed. He feels uncomfortable<br>
    talking about this on the bridge. Troi moves up the<br>
    ramp to stand next to him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm sure he'll do well. She's<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    It might be a good opportunity<br>

  <p> INT. BIOLAB</p>
  <p> A group of SEVERAL N.D. BOYS (roughly the same age as<br>
    Alexander) with their N.D. FATHERS are listening to<br>
    Ms. Kyle. She is holding a small MODEL of a<br>
    rhinoceros, and there are several TABLES with other<br>
    models of animals and plants in the b.g., including<br>
    replicas of a few Earth animals.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    ... as the value of their horns<br>
    increased, the number of white<br>
    Rhinos in the wild kept falling<br>
    until they finally became extinct<br>
    about two centuries ago.</p>
  <p> She puts the model of the animal back on the table and<br>
    begins to move to another part of the lab. The group<br>
    moves to follow her.</p>
  <p>12 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As the group moves with Kyle, we find Worf and<br>
    Alexander bringing up the rear of the group.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    (over following action)<br>
    Now I want to show you a pair of<br>
    animals we're trying to save from<br>
    extinction. They're from Corvan<br>
    Two, where their homes in the<br>
    rainforests are being threatened<br>
    by industrial pollutants.</p>
  <p> Worf is listening intently to the teacher, as if he<br>
    were going to be tested on this stuff. Alexander's<br>
    attention keeps wandering... he's bored. They have<br>
    all arrived at the large cargo container which has a<br>
    large WINDOW dominating one side of the container.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    They're called Corvan Gilvos.</p>
  <p> She touches a panel and a LIGHT COMES ON inside the<br>
    container.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - REV. 10/9/91 - ACT ONE 18.</p>
  <p>13 ON CONTAINER</p>
  <p> There is a medium-sized tree with thick limbs and<br>
    branches surrounded by rocks and a few short bushes<br>
    inside the container, but there doesn't appear to be<br>
    anything else. The children all gather at the<br>
    window... even Alexander appears a little curious...<br>
    but there still doesn't seem to be anything in the<br>
    container. Kyle smiles and taps the glass.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    They're a little shy.</p>
  <p>14 ON TREE</p>
  <p> In response to the tapping on the glass, an EYE<br>
    suddenly opens on one of the &quot;branches&quot; of the tree.<br>
    The GILVO'S body looks like a long skinny piece of bark,<br>
    and until it starts to move along the tree, it is<br>
    virtually undetectable to the naked eye.</p>
  <p>15 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> The children are delighted and they press closer to the<br>
    glass as ANOTHER GILVO starts to MOVE.</p>
  <p> Alexander is enthralled by this creature, and he moves<br>
    right up to the glass and stares at it.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    The eating habits of Gilvos are<br>
    very similar to those of Earth's<br>
    Draco lizards, which died out<br>
    over three hundred years ago...</p>
  <p>16 KYLE</p>
  <p> turns to the nearby table and reaches for something...<br>
    then frowns when it isn't there. She glances at<br>
    Alexander, then recovers smoothly, as if there were<br>
    nothing wrong.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    There are only fourteen Gilvos<br>
    left on Corvan Two. We're<br>
    transplanting these two to the<br>
    protected planet of Brentalia<br>
    where they should thrive.<br>
    We are hopeful that the population<br>
    can be returned home someday.<br>

    questions, feel free to ask.</p>
  <p>17 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> The group breaks up into father and son pairings and<br>
    they move around the bay to explore the different<br>
    displays and models. Alexander stays at the Gilvo<br>
    container, fascinated by the gentle-looking creatures.<br>
    Worf stands next to him, happy that Alexander has<br>
    finally found something to attract his attention.</p>

    I forgot to tell everyone that<br>
    the models on the tables are<br>

  <p> ALEXANDER<br>

    No, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf gives the teacher a vindicated look, but Kyle<br>
    doesn't back down. She keeps her voice low, but her<br>
    tone is firm.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Lieutenant... I saw Alexander<br>
    put the model inside his jacket.</p>

  <p> WORF (V. O)<br>
    Lieutenant Worf, personal log,<br>

    acted shamefully and as his<br>
    father, I must now deal with him.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I find that I would gladly<br>
    fight ten armed Balduk warriors...<br>
    rather than face one small child.</p>
  <p>23 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Worf paces in the outer room, struggling to keep his<br>
    anger below the surface. Alexander is seated, looking<br>
    very small and vulnerable. Uncertain how to deal with<br>
    this situation, Worf is seeking refuge in the familiar<br>
    mantra of Klingon beliefs and values.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A Klingon's honor is more<br>
    important to him than his life.<br>
    A Klingon would gladly face the<br>
    most horrible punishment rather<br>
    than bring shame or disgrace to<br>
    his family name. His word is his<br>
    bond... without it, he is nothing.</p>
  <p> Worf stops pacing and turns to Alexander.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Do you understand?</p>
  <p> Alexander nods mutely.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Why did you lie to me?</p>
  <p> Alexander thinks for a moment... has difficulty meeting<br>
    Worf's eyes.</p>

    You do not know why you lied, and<br>
    yet you did. You do not know why<br>
    you stole, and yet you did!</p>
  <p> Alexander quails before the wrath of his father and<br>
    moves back on the couch in fear. Worf sees the boy's<br>
    reaction and immediately pulls himself back. He turns<br>
    away and moves into the adjoining room for a moment<br>
    to collect himself. Alexander relaxes slightly.</p>
  <p>24 NEW ANGLE</p>

    you... I lost my parents, my<br>
    family... my people. Everything<br>
    I had was taken from me... except<br>
    my sense of honor. It was the<br>
    one thing I had which was truly<br>
    Klingon... and which no one could<br>
    take away.</p>
  <p> Worf gestures to a small statue of two fighting<br>

    When you lie or steal, you<br>
    dishonor not only yourself, but<br>
    your family.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You dishonor me.</p>
  <p> The words are damning and hit Alexander almost with<br>
    physical force. His lip trembles and he is on the<br>
    verge of tears. He looks up at his father with remorse<br>
    written all over his face.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I'm sorry, father. I won't do<br>

  <p> WORF<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    You disapprove?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm not here to approve or<br>
    disapprove of the way you raise<br>
    your son.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    My concern right now is how this<br>
    decision is going to affect you.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts with surprise.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    How will you feel when Alexander<br>
    is gone?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will be... pleased that he is<br>
    receiving the guidance that he<br>
    requires.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Is that how you felt when he left<br>
    to live with your parents?</p>
  <p> Worf struggles with this for a moment... his inner<br>
    turmoil drives him to another part of the room.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That was... different. At that<br>
    time, I felt he needed a home...<br>
    a family... things I could not<br>
    provide for him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I understand. The idea of raising<br>
    a child can seem like... a<br>
    tremendous burden, particularly<br>
    to a solitary parent.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (too quickly)<br>
    He was no burden.</p>
  <p> Troi simply sits and waits. Worf feels compelled to<br>
    explain.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I simply knew that a Klingon child<br>
    would require more... attention<br>
    than I could provide.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    I see.<br>
    (long beat)<br>
    Have you ever wondered how<br>
    Alexander felt about being sent<br>
    away?</p>
  <p> Worf pauses for a moment.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He was very young. I'm sure he<br>
    was... confused...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Do you think he might have felt...<br>
    abandoned?</p>
  <p> Worf reacts... he hadn't considered that possibility.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    After all, he left very soon after<br>
    K'Ehleyr's death. In a way, he<br>
    not only lost his mother... he<br>
    lost his father as well.</p>
  <p> Worf thinks for a moment.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Are you saying that his...<br>
    misconduct is a result of feeling<br>
    abandoned?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's possible. Children don't<br>
    have the experience to handle<br>
    emotional crises. Instead of<br>
    dealing with their feelings, they<br>
    act on them.</p>

  <p>54 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Troi stands and goes to Worf... when she speaks, it's<br>
    on a more personal level than strictly<br>
    Counselor/patient... drawing on their years together<br>
    aboard ship and the trust they've built between them,<br>
    she talks to him in a way that no one else can.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (gently)<br>
    Worf... tell me about the last<br>
    time you spoke with K'Ehleyr...<br>
    the night she died.</p>
  <p> Worf keeps his face completely expressionless...<br>
    tightly clamping down the pain within... but his voice<br>
    is quieter and softer than we've ever heard before.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We... argued.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    About what?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Alexander. Why she had... not<br>
    told me about him when he was<br>
    born.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    So you were angry with her?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (a whisper)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Are you still angry with her?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Of course not.</p>
  <p> But Worf can't meet her eyes as he says it. Worf tries<br>
    to clamp his emotions down again... he turns to move<br>
    away, but Troi gently puts a hand on his arm and stops<br>
    him.</p>

  <p>54 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (gently)<br>
    It would be very normal for you<br>
    to be angry with her... angry<br>
    because she died and left you<br>
    alone with a son you never knew<br>
    you had.</p>
  <p> Troi has cut very close to the bone. Worf is<br>
    embarrassed... hurt... angry... but he clearly can't<br>
    deny the truth in her words.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Being angry doesn't mean you loved<br>
    her any less, Worf... but you<br>
    cannot hide from your<br>
    feelings... just as Alexander<br>
    cannot hide from his.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You both have a lot of healing<br>
    to do... perhaps you should think<br>
    about doing it together.</p>

  <p> Alexander is violently stuffing his belongings into<br>
    a suitcase with a great deal of anger. Worf ENTERS<br>

    tries to make a genuine connection with the boy.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Alexander...</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I'm almost done.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Let us... talk.</p>
  <p> Worf is trying, but the boy's defenses are up and he<br>
    clearly isn't going to make this easy for Worf.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I want you to understand why<br>
    you're going away.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    (getting more<br>
    belligerent)<br>
    I understand. You're ashamed of<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (firm)<br>
    You do not understand. I am<br>
    concerned about your future. A<br>
    Klingon school will be a better<br>
    environment for you.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    You don't care about me.</p>

    Lieutenant Worf, please report<br>
    to the observation lounge.</p>
  <p> This is really bad timing. Worf struggles to tamp down<br>

    Alexander glares at him in anger.</p>

    Alexander)<br>
    Remain here. I will return<br>

  <p> Worf EXITS. Stay with Alexander for a moment... his<br>
    rage and feelings of frustration continue to build...<br>
    finally he erupts in anger and KNOCKS OVER the table<br>
    in fury. He hesitates for a moment and then EXITS.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Excuse me.</p>
  <p> No one else seems upset by his late entrance and Geordi<br>
    continues.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The soliton wave has continued<br>
    to increase in power. Its energy<br>
    level has risen by a factor of<br>
    ninety-six.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - REV. 10/10/91 - ACT FOUR 46A.</p>
  <p>56 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI (cont'd)<br>
    At its present rate of<br>
    acceleration, the wave will hit<br>
    the planet in about two hours.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How do we stop it?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There are two possibilities: we<br>
    could try to use our warp engines<br>
    to generate an inverse resonance<br>
    wave. If we match the exact<br>
    frequency and amplitude of the<br>
    soliton, we'd be able to<br>
    neutralize it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You don't sound very confident.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Because the soliton is constantly<br>
    changing in both frequency and<br>
    amplitude, it will be extremely<br>
    difficult to achieve a precise<br>
    match.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's hear the second option.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - REV. 10/9/91 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>56 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's a little more dangerous, but<br>
    I think there's a better chance<br>
    for success. We could create<br>
    a... backfire -- an explosive<br>
    force set off just in front of<br>
    the soliton wave. A large enough<br>
    explosion... say five photon<br>
    torpedoes... should disrupt the<br>
    wave and allow it to dissipate.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How fast is the wave travelling<br>
    now?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Warp six point three seven.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The good news is we can catch it.<br>
    The bad news is in order to set<br>
    up the backfire we have to be in<br>
    front of it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Which would require the Enterprise<br>
    to go through the wave.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why can't we go around it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The wave has grown in size as well<br>
    as power. There is insufficient<br>
    time remaining for us to<br>
    circumvent it before it reaches<br>
    Lemma Two.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How much protection will our<br>
    shields provide if we attempt to<br>
    penetrate the wave?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

    It would be a rough ride.</p>
  <p> Picard thinks for a beat, then makes the decision.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (on the move)<br>
    It's the better choice. Number<br>
    One, lay in a course for the<br>
    soliton wave.</p>
  <p> Everyone starts to head for the exit.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, may I speak with you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Certainly.</p>
  <p> Everyone else EXITS. Worf still hasn't made a decision<br>
    regarding Alexander, and he is looking to Picard for<br>
    confirmation that his plan is the right thing to do.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I know that I have been distracted<br>
    by... family matters and that I<br>
    have not been performing my duties<br>
    in a satisfactory manner.</p>
  <p> Picard is surprised to hear this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, I have not been<br>
    dissatisfied with your<br>
    performance.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But I am dissatisfied, Captain.<br>
    And I will be taking steps which<br>
    will remedy the problem.</p>

    (off console)<br>
    Sir, biolab four is in one of the<br>
    areas that will be flooded with<br>
    ion radiation.</p>

    Commander.</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf stop and look back at him.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (firm)<br>
    I can't let the soliton wave hit<br>
    the colony. You have three<br>
    minutes... not one second more.</p>
  <p> Worf and Riker nod grim understanding and then EXIT.</p>

  <p>68 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Worf and Riker race down the corridor to the biolab<br>
    door. Riker tries to work the panel outside the doors<br>
    for a beat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Primary control's shorted out.</p>
  <p> Worf moves quickly to the panel and RIPS it off the<br>
    wall. He reaches inside and works some of the circuits<br>
    and boards. After a quick beat he turns back to Riker.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Stand clear.</p>
  <p> Riker goes to the opposite side of the door and puts<br>
    his back against the wall. Worf positions himself on<br>
    his side of the door. Once they're in place, Riker<br>
    nods to Worf, who then works the control panel on the<br>
    wall and the doors OPEN. A LARGE TONGUE OF FLAME<br>
    shoots out into the corridor. The flame falls back<br>
    for a beat after its initial flare up, giving Riker<br>
    and Worf a chance to run into...</p>
  <p>69 INT. BIOLAB - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf ENTER a room filled with FIRE and SMOKE.<br>
    The doors CLOSE behind them and they struggle against<br>
    the smoke and try to see through the haze. Keeping low<br>
    to the ground, they move out in different directions.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Alexander!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Alexander!</p>
  <p>70 WORF</p>
  <p> Knocks a burning container out of his way and looks<br>
    around frantically.</p>
  <p> RIKER (o.c.)<br>
    Alexander, can you hear me?</p>
  <p> Worf sees something and moves toward it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - REV. 10/10/91 - ACT FIVE 53A.</p>
  <p>70A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE AND WAVE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The wave is getting closer to the Enterprise</p>
  <p>71 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As before. There is a N.D. Crewmember at tactical</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    The soliton wave has closed to<br>
    ten kilometers, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Stand by to fire torpedoes on my<br>
    command.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - REV. 10/9/91 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>72 INT. BIOLAB</p>
  <p> Worf finds Alexander pinned underneath some debris.<br>
    The Gilvo container is nearby.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I've found him, Commander!</p>
  <p> Worf checks the boy's pulse and is relieved to see that<br>
    he's still alive. Worf starts ripping apart the<br>
    wreckage that's piled on top of Alexander.</p>
  <p>73 RIKER</p>
  <p> struggles to find Worf in the smoky gloom.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf!</p>
  <p> WORF (o.c.)<br>
    Over here!</p>
  <p> Riker finally sees them and rushes over. Alexander<br>
    moans and stirs as Worf and Riker struggle to clear the<br>
    debris together. There is a single large beam pinning<br>
    Alexander. They struggle to lift it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's too heavy. We need<br>
    something to help us.</p>
  <p> Riker moves off in search of something to use as a<br>
    lever. Alexander begins to come around and Worf bends<br>
    down to him.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    (coughing)<br>
    Father?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Be still, I am here.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    My leg hurts. I'm scared.</p>
  <p> Galvanized by the need of his son and the desperate<br>
    situation, Worf grabs the huge beam with both hands,<br>
    and with a superKlingon effort... HEAVES the heavy beam<br>
    off of Alexander.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - REV. 10/7/91 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>74 RIKER</p>
  <p> Returns with a long pole just as the beam clatters to<br>
    the floor. He gives the heavy beam a quick look of<br>
    surprise. As Worf bends down to pick up Alexander,<br>
    the boy points at the container and cries out...</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    The Gilvos! Don't leave them<br>
    here!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (objecting)<br>
    There's no time.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    They'll die! Please!</p>
  <p> Worf looks at Riker, who glances at the imploring face<br>
    of Alexander. Riker finally reacts with an &quot;I don't<br>
    believe I'm doing this&quot; expression, then quickly moves<br>
    to the Gilvo container and opens the door.</p>

    acknowledge.</p>

    The wave is about to overtake us,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    Commander Riker, acknowledge!</p>
  <p> Picard waits for one more beat... finally has no<br>
    choice.</p>

    Fire torpedoes.</p>

  <p>75A INT. SCIENCE LAB</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf (carrying the Gilvos and Alexander<br>
    respectively) race through the burning lab, trying to<br>
    get to the door...</p>

  <p> The ship FIRES torpedoes from the stern of the ship.</p>
  <p>77 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf (still carrying the animals and the boy)<br>
    burst out of the science lab. The doors CLOSE behind<br>
    them. They sag against the wall, coughing and gasping<br>
    for air.</p>
  <p>78 EXT. SPACE - THE SOLITON WAVE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The torpedoes EXPLODE directly in front of the Soliton<br>
    wave. The wave HITS the explosion, there is a large<br>
    BURST OF ENERGY... then the wave dissipates.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - REV. 10/7/91 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>

    The wave has been disrupted,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't pause for even one beat of relief at<br>
    this news.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (urgent, to com)<br>
    Picard to Riker.</p>
  <p> A tense beat passes before Riker answers.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    (hoarse)<br>
    Riker here, Captain.</p>
  <p> INTERCUT WITH:</p>
  <p>80 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Just outside the biolab. Riker is holding the two<br>
    Gilvos in his arms while Worf and Alexander cling to<br>
    each other. Picard is very relieved as Riker makes<br>
    his report.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to com)<br>
    We made it, sir. The boy's going<br>
    to be all right.</p>
  <p> Hold a moment on Alexander and Worf tightly clutching<br>
    one another.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>

  <p> The ship hanging in space.</p>

  <p>82 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Alexander is lying on one of the beds. Worf stands<br>
    beside the bed, watching carefully. BEVERLY is<br>
    checking him over with a medical tricorder.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;New Ground&quot; - REV. 10/7/91 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>82 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Alexander)<br>
    You're a very lucky little boy...<br>
    just some minor smoke inhalation<br>
    and a hairline fracture of the<br>
    tibia.<br>
    (beat, then with a<br>
    smile)<br>
    That's a bone in your leg.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    I'd like to keep him overnight,<br>
    but he should be fine by<br>
    tomorrow.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Thank you, Doctor.</p>
  <p> Beverly smiles and moves away. Alexander looks up at<br>
    Worf, uncertain what to expect.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Are you going to get in trouble<br>
    because of me?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Do not concern yourself with that.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Am I in trouble?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Yes... but we will discuss that<br>
    at a later time.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> He is genuinely sorry and it shows. His eyes fall and<br>
    his voice gets quieter.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I promise I'll be good at the<br>
    Klingon school. I'll make you<br>
    proud of me.</p>
  <p> Worf studies him for a moment.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Klingon schools are designed to<br>
    be difficult.<br>

  <p> WORF (cont'd)<br>
    The physical and mental hardships<br>
    faced by the students are meant<br>
    to build strength and character.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    However, if you wish to face a<br>
    greater challenge... you may stay<br>
    here with me.</p>
  <p> Alexander's face lights up.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It will not be easy... for either<br>
    one of us... but, perhaps we can<br>
    face the challenge together.</p>
  <p> Alexander straightens up slightly.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    (seriously)<br>
    I accept your challenge, Father.<br>
    I will stay.</p>
  <p> Worf nods in grave acceptance.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I believe your... mother would<br>
    be pleased.</p>
  <p> After a beat, Alexander's face breaks out into a smile<br>
    and Worf returns it as well. Worf puts a hand on his<br>
    son's shoulder and we begin to see a real bond forming<br>
    between the two for the first time.</p>
