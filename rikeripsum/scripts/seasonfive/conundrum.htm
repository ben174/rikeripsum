    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Coming out of warp.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45494.2.<br>
    We are investigating a series of<br>
    subspace signals that may indicate<br>
    intelligent life in the Epsilon<br>
    Silar System. We will be within<br>
    sensor range in three hours...</p>
  <p>2 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> DATA and TROI are sitting at the bar, immersed in a<br>
    game of three-dimensional chess. Data is clearly<br>
    winning. He moves a piece, then waits as Troi<br>
    contemplates the board. Troi moves a piece. Data<br>
    reacts, puzzled.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The characteristic response to<br>
    the Kriskov Gambit is to counter<br>
    with an el-Mitra Exchange --<br>
    particularly since I have already<br>
    taken both your rooks. By missing<br>
    that opportunity, you have left<br>
    your king vulnerable.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We'll see...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    As you wish.</p>
  <p> Data makes a move that takes one of Troi's pieces.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Check.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conundrum&quot; - REV. 11/25/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Troi immediately makes a counter move. Data reacts,<br>
    puzzled. Then studies the board for several seconds.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Intriguing. You have devised a<br>
    completely unanticipated response<br>
    to a classic attack.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You will checkmate my king in<br>
    seven moves.</p>
  <p> Troi starts putting the pieces back to their original<br>
    starting positions.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Chess isn't just a game of gambits<br>
    and ploys -- it's also a game of<br>
    intuition.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are a challenging opponent.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Thanks. But don't think a<br>
    compliment's going to get you out<br>
    of our bet.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You owe me one Samarian Sunset.<br>
    Served in the traditional style.<br>
    As only you can make it, Data...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will honor our agreement.</p>
  <p> Data stands and walks toward the bar. OFF Troi's<br>
    smile...</p>
  <p>3 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY is running a medical scanner over the shoulder<br>
    and upper arm of a very athletic woman in her<br>
    mid-twenties -- KRISTIN -- who is wearing a one-piece<br>
    24th-century SWIMSUIT, and sitting on a bio-bed.<br>
    Kristin is gritting her teeth in obvious pain.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Raise your arm out to the side.</p>
  <p> Kristin does so -- but only comes up about halfway.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conundrum&quot; - REV. 11/25/91 - TEASER 2A.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (re: the elevation)<br>
    Is that it?</p>
  <p> KRISTIN<br>
    I'm afraid so.</p>
  <p> A beat as Beverly takes another reading.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You can put your arm down now.</p>
  <p> Kristin does so.</p>
  <p> KRISTIN<br>
    (re: Beverly's readings)<br>
    What do you think?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    I think it looks like you tucked<br>
    when you should have flattened<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conundrum&quot; - REV. 11/25/91 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> KRISTIN<br>
    Something like that...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Turn your head to the left.</p>
  <p> Kristin does so -- and winces. Beverly continues<br>
    waving the instrument.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Some tearing in the ligaments --<br>
    nothing we can't take care of.</p>
  <p> KRISTIN<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> Beverly takes the instrument down.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If I remember correctly, the last<br>
    time you graced my sickbay, you<br>
    were diving off the &quot;Cliffs of<br>
    Heaven&quot; on Cirrus Four. Holodeck<br>
    program 47-C.</p>
  <p> KRISTIN<br>
    Same thing. Only that time, I<br>
    flattened out when I should have<br>
    tucked.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    As your Doctor, I'd like to<br>
    recommend the Emerald Wading Pool<br>
    on Sumiko Three. It's a lot<br>
    safer.</p>
  <p> Kristin can't help but smile.</p>
  <p>4 OMITTED</p>
  <p>4A INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> As Riker and Ro enter in the middle of an<br>
    argument... she's smiling at him as they go at it, she<br>
    almost enjoys the exchange...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Navigators on this ship have been<br>
    doing flight handling assessments<br>
    the same way for years, Ensign...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conundrum&quot; - REV. 11/15/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    And I've found a better way...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Bridge.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Do you mind if we discuss changes<br>
    in procedure before you make them?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    If I had come to you in advance<br>
    and asked you if I could do it<br>
    my way...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I would have said...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    &quot;No&quot;.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Or maybe &quot;yes&quot;.</p>
  <p> His answer surprises her. She doesn't respond.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The point is -- I never got that<br>
    chance.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    The point is... with all due<br>
    respect... you're trying to turn<br>
    me into your idea of a model<br>
    officer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ensign... the rules on this ship<br>
    don't change because Ro Laren<br>
    decides they do.</p>
  <p> The turbolift door opens. As they EXIT --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conundrum&quot; - 11/14/91 - TEASER 4A.</p>
  <p>5 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD and WORF are at their stations; GEORDI at an aft<br>
    console.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off console)<br>
    We are picking up a subspace<br>
    signal, Captain. Sensors show<br>
    a small space craft ahead.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conundrum&quot; - 11/14/91 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The configuration is unfamiliar<br>
    -- nothing in our database comes<br>
    close.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Within visual range.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>6 VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A small ALIEN SHIP appears on the screen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Analysis, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No discernable armament. Reading<br>
    one life-form aboard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hail the vessel.</p>
  <p> A beat of silence.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No response, Captain.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off console)<br>
    We're being scanned... but it's<br>
    not like any sensor system I've<br>
    ever seen... Should we raise<br>
    shields?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. We'll start this off with<br>
    a show of good faith.</p>
  <p> Geordi nods. A beat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, the scans are now matching<br>
    the frequencies of our optical<br>
    data network.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conundrum&quot; - 11/14/91 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF (cont'd)<br>
    (looks up)<br>
    It could be an attempt to access<br>
    our computer system.</p>
  <p> Geordi glances up from his console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Scanning intensity has increased<br>
    by fifteen hundred percent.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Shields up.</p>
  <p>7 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Troi is at the bar. Data is BEHIND THE BAR, serving<br>
    Troi a glass of gray liquid.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (re: drink)<br>
    One Samarian Sunset, served in<br>
    the traditional style.</p>
  <p> Data sets the drink down, then flicks the lip of the<br>
    glass with his finger. The glass PINGS --</p>
  <p>8 THE DRINK (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> instantly comes alive with exotic colors. A sunset in<br>
    a glass.</p>
  <p>9 RESUME</p>
  <p> Troi is delighted.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's beautiful.</p>
  <p> Data nods.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I hope you enjoy it.</p>
  <p> Troi reaches for the drink -- Data again nods. Exactly<br>
    the same motion he performed before.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conundrum&quot; - 11/14/91 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I hope you enjoy it.</p>
  <p> His voice is exactly the same. Troi looks up to see<br>
    Data now completely still, as if frozen.</p>
  <p> OFF her reaction.</p>
  <p>10 INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As before. Worf is rapidly working his console,<br>
    stunned at what he sees.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The scanning signal has penetrated<br>
    our shields...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Our computers are going down!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Take evasive action --</p>
  <p> As Ro tries to react --</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    -- The helm's not responding!</p>
  <p> FLASH! A BRIGHT GREEN LIGHT fills the bridge,<br>
    completely washing out the scene. A moment later, as<br>
    the light slowly FADES...</p>
  <p>11 CLOSE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> In the same position as before, tense and ready for<br>
    action. Except now, his expression is blank and<br>
    movements uncertain. He looks disoriented, touches his<br>
    head, squints as if it aches. Then suddenly he stops,<br>
    looks around.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p>12 REVEAL</p>
  <p> Everyone else on the bridge, behaving the same way.<br>
    Disoriented, looking around, uncertain of their<br>
    bearings.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conundrum&quot; - 11/14/91 - TEASER 8.</p>
  <p>13 GEORDI AND WORF</p>
  <p> look at each other as if strangers meeting for the<br>
    first time.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What the hell...</p>
  <p>14 RO</p>
  <p> stares dumbfounded at her hands still on the console --<br>
    not knowing what they're doing there.</p>
  <p>15 PICARD AND RIKER</p>
  <p> look at each other. Riker glances at the others.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't know who any of you are.</p>
  <p> Picard stares at him, his mind a blank.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Neither do I... I don't even<br>
    remember who I am...</p>
  <p> Picard exchanges a glance with the person standing next<br>
    to him...</p>
  <p>16 REVEAL</p>
  <p> MACDUFF, a man in his late thirties, dressed in<br>
    Starfleet Command uniform. We have never seen this man<br>
    before now (he was not present before the flash of<br>
    light), but he appears to be equally disoriented.</p>
  <p> OFF the crew's look of utter confusion...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conundrum&quot; - 11/14/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>17 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Continuous action. Picard, Riker, Worf, Geordi, Ro and<br>
    MacDuff are in a state of astonishment. They have all<br>
    lost their memories (EXCEPT MACDUFF -- TO REVEAL<br>
    LATER). It's a bizarre situation, the Enterprise crew<br>
    suddenly strangers in a strange place. Everyone reacts<br>
    to their obviously shared predicament.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It looks like we're all in the<br>
    same boat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: viewscreen)<br>
    Make that -- &quot;on the same<br>
    starship.&quot;</p>
  <p>18 INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> and the motionless stars.</p>
  <p> MACDUFF<br>
    But who are we? What are we doing<br>
    here?</p>
  <p>19 RO</p>
  <p> turns from her console.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    It looks like I'm the pilot.</p>
  <p> She quickly and automatically keys several controls on<br>
    the console.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We're not going anywhere now.<br>
    The helm's dead.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conundrum&quot; - 11/14/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>20 INCLUDE BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But you still know how to work<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (curious)<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> Riker looks over Worf's shoulder at Worf's instruments.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This console has a tactical<br>
    configuration.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    Phaser power status, intruder<br>
    scan, torpedo guidance...</p>
  <p> Worf attempts the controls.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    They do not appear to be operable.</p>
  <p>21 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Picard turns to the others in explanation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Clearly, we still possess certain<br>
    skills -- we seem to know how to<br>
    operate this vessel. But our<br>
    identities have somehow been<br>
    erased, or suppressed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conundrum&quot; - 11/14/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We are on the bridge -- there's<br>
    a good chance this is our ship.</p>
  <p> A beat at Riker notices the pips on Picard's uniform.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing; to Picard)<br>
    And it looks like you're the<br>
    leader.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We should not jump to conclusions.<br>
    (indicating own sash)<br>
    I am... decorated as well.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Determining our command structure<br>
    isn't crucial right now. Finding<br>
    out who we are, and what we're<br>
    doing out here is.</p>
  <p> A beat. Worf keeps silent. He might not agree, but he<br>
    won't argue the point for now.</p>
  <p> MACDUFF<br>
    But how did this happen? What<br>
    did this to us?</p>
  <p>22 GEORDI</p>
  <p> glances up from his station.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    More like -- who did this to us?</p>
  <p>23 RESUME</p>
  <p> as everyone looks over toward Geordi.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (indicating monitor)<br>
    I've got some intermittent sensor<br>
    readings here... the scan keeps<br>
    repeating itself -- like it's<br>
    stuck. But it looks like there's<br>
    metallic debris right in front<br>
    of us. Distance: seventeen<br>
    kilometers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The remains of another ship?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conundrum&quot; - 11/14/91 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's a good possibility.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Perhaps we were engaged in battle.</p>
  <p> MACDUFF<br>
    If they stunned us with some kind<br>
    of bioelectric field -- that might<br>
    have wiped out our memories.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Then we fired back. Destroyed<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> There is a moment as they reflect on these<br>
    possibilities.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If this presumption is correct,<br>
    we may have sustained other<br>
    damage.<br>
    (to COM)<br>
    Computer... status report.</p>
  <p> No answer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No voice interface...</p>
  <p>24 GEORDI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> still at his console and monitor, trying to work the<br>
    commands.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No interface, period.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conundrum&quot; - 11/14/91 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> His monitor suddenly comes alive with a rotating<br>
    graphic of the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hey -- got something.</p>

  <p> Riker and Ro exchange a look. Ro is finding this<br>
    situation particularly difficult to handle -- but<br>
    there's a &quot;we're in this together&quot; kind of feel between<br>
    them, in contrast to what we saw before they lost their<br>
    memories.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do we have an onboard<br>

  <p> Geordi makes a quick pass on the console, which BEEPS<br>
    in response. He turns to Picard.</p>

    So far, our survey team has found<br>

    transporters.</p>

    Engineering is working on<br>
    accessing the control systems.<br>
    As soon as the ship is<br>
    operational, we must make it<br>

  <p> Worf may be sitting in the captain's chair, but<br>
    Picard's natural sense of leadership cannot help but<br>
    assert itself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I would recommend that before we<br>
    prepare for combat, we try to<br>
    access the ship's logs. Discover<br>
    who we are and what our purpose<br>
    here might be.</p>
  <p> However, having gained the territory, Worf is not about<br>
    to yield it easily.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I disagree. We must first make<br>
    ourselves ready for battle. That<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not much. The brain scans I've<br>
    run are unusual, but they show<br>
    no damage to the hippocampus.<br>
    That suggests we still have our<br>
    long-term memories... but somehow<br>
    they're being blocked.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is it possible to bypass the<br>
    normal pathways? To get at those<br>
    memories in some other way?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's what I'm hoping. What I<br>
    need now is to see some normal<br>
    brain scans for comparison. Is<br>
    there any chance I could get the<br>

    We haven't finished a full search<br>

    we've found out quite a bit.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This vessel is named the<br>
    Enterprise. We are part of an<br>

    The Lysian Alliance. They're a<br>

  <p> Picard absorbs this information, listening intently as<br>
    his crew reports.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Starfleet Command believes<br>
    the Lysians have a new weapon that<br>
    has shifted the balance of power<br>
    in their favor.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Over the last two months, fourteen<br>
    Federation ships have been<br>
    captured -- apparently very easily<br>
    -- and the crews imprisoned on<br>
    Lysia.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What do we know about this weapon?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Our scientists theorize that the<br>
    Lysians are using an energy wave<br>
    -- either plasma based or a<br>
    subspace interference pattern.<br>
    The weapon severly disrupts a<br>
    starship's computer systems and<br>

    Can you remember anything<br>
    specific?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

  <p> She reaches up and runs a finger across his cheek, as<br>
    if by touching she'll draw out what's forgotten.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's more like remembering an<br>
    emotional image... feelings that<br>
    are somehow associated with you...</p>
  <p> The romantic tension is now undeniable.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I hope they're good feelings...</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    This entire situation is... a<br>
    little unnerving...</p>

    been through a lot.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes. We certainly have.</p>
  <p> She regards him for a moment, then leans up and briefly<br>
    kisses his cheek.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll see you tomorrow. Good<br>

    slung over the arm, dressed in casual, sexy clothing,<br>

  <p> RO<br>
    I didn't like the way mine was<br>
    decorated. Besides, I have a<br>
    funny feeling maybe I spend most<br>
    of my off hours here.</p>
  <p> Riker tosses the PADD down, decides to take on her<br>
    bantering challenge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Really?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    For all we know, you and I could<br>
    be married.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> Ro smiles. She circles around him, maneuvering closer<br>
    to the bed.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    That's kind of exciting, isn't<br>
    it? Because we just don't know.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We might regret this.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Regret what? Aren't you being<br>
    a little presumptuous?</p>
  <p> Ro gets very close to him, teasingly. The erotic<br>
    tension is high.</p>

    (continuing)<br>
    Like I said -- I just didn't like<br>
    the way my quarters were<br>
    decorated.</p>
  <p> She backs off, as if rejecting him -- but it's all<br>
    seductive. Riker takes a step toward her. She moves<br>
    closer to the bed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe we should switch quarters.</p>

    Riker closes the distance.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What if I snore in my sleep?</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor, the success of this<br>
    mission would be far more likely<br>
    if we had our memories back. Is<br>
    there anything you can do?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I found several cases resembling<br>
    our condition in the medical<br>
    index. The causes are different,<br>
    but the cure is similar in each<br>
    case.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Could the same treatment work for<br>
    us?</p>

    That's my hope. It involves<br>
    increasing the activity of the<br>
    medial temporal region of the<br>
    brain. Using short term memory<br>
    synapses to retrieve long term<br>
    memory.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    When can you start?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    As soon as our medical records<br>
    become available. It would be<br>
    too dangerous to attempt treatment<br>
    without them.</p>

    Then again, you could've been<br>

  <p> A trombone... a few books... some terra cotta<br>
    figurines. The door chimes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    for a while?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Please...</p>
  <p> Riker indicates his welcome, then sees that she appears<br>
    shaken. He stands and moves over to her.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What's wrong?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Everything. Everytime I think<br>
    about this war, our mission...<br>
    I feel a sense of panic. Like<br>
    a hand is closing around my<br>
    throat.</p>
  <p> Riker speaks gently... tries to console her.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're never gonna feel good about<br>
    this war. None of us will. But<br>
    we've got to finish our mission.</p>
  <p> Troi considers this... then nods. His words make<br>
    sense, but still...</p>
  <p> Riker smiles, trying to brighten the mood a little. He<br>
    indicates the nearby desk.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I've been doing a little research.<br>
    Learning about someone named<br>
    William Riker.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    And what have you discovered?</p>
  <p> Riker leads her to the desk. He indicates the<br>
    trombone.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He's a musician, for one thing.</p>

    instrument, plays a few notes. Troi laughs.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Very impressive.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Nobody could have been more<br>
    surprised than me.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (playfully)<br>
    What else has your research<br>
    uncovered about William Riker?</p>
  <p> Riker eyes the various belongings.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's see... He's athletically<br>
    inclined... loves to mountain<br>
    climb. He was born in a place<br>
    called Alaska. He likes exotic<br>
    foods... spends his vacation time<br>
    on a planet called Risa...</p>
  <p> Riker picks up a very slender, but beautifully bound<br>
    BOOK and hands it to Troi. She looks at the title.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

    &quot;Ode to Psyche.&quot; John Keats.</p>

    I... don't know what to think.</p>
  <p> The door chimes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> Ro ENTERS. She's energized from work -- a sharp<br>
    contrast to the quiet she's just shattered.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Hello, Counselor.</p>
  <p> She reacts to Troi's presence -- but it's with an<br>
    amused tolerance. Troi and Riker seem much more<br>
    uncomfortable than Ro does.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    Ensign.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I'm not interrupting anything?</p>
  <p> RIKER TROI<br>
    No. No.</p>
  <p> Troi smiles.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to Ro)<br>
    I was just visiting.<br>
    (to Riker, more formal)<br>
    We'll talk again soon, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Of course. Thank you, Counselor.</p>
  <p> As Troi goes out the door...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Bye...</p>
  <p> When Troi disappears outside the door, Ro casually<br>
    eases into a chair, catching one of Riker's hands in<br>
    her own as she does so.</p>

  <p> RO<br>

    closed -- as if he's unconscious. Beverly works the<br>
    console next to the bed, and the series of lights flash<br>
    on and off on the headpiece. A NURSE is working in the<br>
    background.</p>
  <p> Beverly takes her hand off the console and picks up a<br>
    med device, waves it across his forehead. She seems<br>
    puzzled by the result.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's strange. The diencephalic<br>

    Something's wrong with the<br>
    sequencing program!</p>

    stops blinking. His body goes rigid. Beverly picks up<br>
    a device and runs it over his forehead.</p>

  <p> He stops and looks squarely at MacDuff.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I need a moral context to justify<br>
    that action. And I don't have<br>
    one. I'm not satisfied simply<br>
    following orders. I want to know<br>
    that what I am doing is right.</p>
  <p> MACDUFF<br>
    So do I. I'd feel a lot better<br>
    about this if all the questions<br>
    were answered. And if you want<br>
    to abandon our mission until our<br>
    memories return -- it's your<br>
    choice.</p>
  <p> MacDuff pauses, as if searching for the words.</p>
  <p> MACDUFF<br>
    But I must ask you... is it right<br>
    to risk prolonging this war...<br>
    to allow the needless deaths of<br>
    thousands on both sides... solely<br>
    on the basis of our moral<br>

  <p>83 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it runs straight through the field of sentry pods.<br>
    We instantly draw A THIN LASER BEAM TYPE FIRE from the<br>
    pods that does nothing to the Enterprise. The<br>
    Enterprise returns with PHASER FIRE -- a series of<br>
    quick bursts, DESTROYING the pods with ease.</p>
  <p>84 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We are through the perimeter.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is too easy.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We have yet to encounter any<br>
    battleships. They may lie ahead.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Load all torpedo bays. Ready<br>
    phasers.</p>
  <p> But it's clear Picard's doubts are mounting.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf works the console.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Approaching the Central Command...</p>
  <p> Picard reacts, puzzled at the ease with which they are<br>
    able to appoach.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, scan for defenses.</p>
  <p> Data works the console.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am picking up no vessels -- and<br>
    no additional sentry pods.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The station is in visual range.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p>85 INCLUDE THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> In the distance is the LYSIAN CENTRAL COMMAND -- a<br>
    huge, alien-looking space station.</p>
  <p> Reactions to the sight.</p>

    Optimal firing range in fifty-five<br>

  <p>86 RESUME (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> MACDUFF<br>
    (works console)<br>
    Phaser banks ready. Loading<br>
    torpedoes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What are the defensive<br>
    capabilities of the Central<br>
    Command?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Armaments consist of four laser<br>
    cannons and thirty-nine cobalt<br>
    fusion warheads with magnetic<br>
    propulsion. Defensive shield<br>
    output is only... four point<br>
    three kilojoules.</p>
  <p> Picard is deeply disturbed by this news. All the<br>
    doubts of this entire endeavor rise to inundate him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (amazed)<br>
    One photon torpedo ought to do<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Data... how many people are on<br>
    that station?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off instruments)<br>
    Fifteen thousand, three hundred<br>
    eleven.</p>
  <p> Again, this registers on Picard. His moment of<br>
    decision is nearing.</p>
  <p> MACDUFF<br>
    Captain, we're in range.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (gesturing to hold up)<br>
    Stand by.</p>
  <p> A concerned reaction from MacDuff.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conundrum&quot; - REV. 11/15/91 - ACT FIVE 64.</p>
  <p>86 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MACDUFF<br>
    Waiting for your order, sir.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, this isn't right...</p>
  <p> MACDUFF<br>
    The rest of our forces are<br>
    depending on us --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How can our mortal enemy be over<br>
    a hundred years behind us in<br>
    weapons technology?</p>
  <p> MACDUFF<br>
    Their battleships may be on the<br>
    way right now.</p>
  <p> A beat. MacDuff keeps on pushing.</p>
  <p> MACDUFF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We must attack.</p>
  <p> A long moment -- it's all on Picard. From deep inside,<br>
    his conscience finds voice, and speaks clear as a bell<br>
    -- a simple statement confirming his fundamental<br>
    nature.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I do not fire on defenseless<br>
    people.</p>
  <p> Various reactions from the others.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf... open a channel to<br>
    the Lysians.</p>
  <p> MacDuff is enraged -- losing control.</p>
  <p> MACDUFF<br>
    Belay that order!</p>
  <p> MacDuff is on the move toward tactical. Worf wavers.<br>
    MacDuff addresses everyone as he goes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conundrum&quot; - 11/14/91 - ACT FIVE 65.</p>
  <p>86 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> MACDUFF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There's something wrong with the<br>
    Captain. I'm taking command of<br>
    this vessel.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Fire all weapons!</p>
  <p> Worf doesn't move. MacDuff, now wild-eyed with<br>
    desperation exchanges a look with Picard, who by<br>
    contrast is all cool control.</p>
  <p> -- MacDuff lunges toward tactical, knocking Worf out<br>
    of the way like he wasn't even there. He reaches for<br>
    the weapons control...</p>
  <p> -- and is suddenly hit by a PHASER BLAST, briefly<br>
    revealing beneath his Human self, in the area where<br>
    he was hit, a strange, alien, metallic body.</p>
  <p>87 OMITTED</p>
  <p>88 INCLUDE RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> holding the phaser. MacDuff again goes for the console<br>
    -- Riker again FIRES the phaser, and where it hits,<br>
    the strange metallic being underneath is revealed.<br>
    MacDuff stumbles back, but goes for it again --<br>
    unstoppable.</p>
  <p> Worf has regained his footing, and FIRES his phaser<br>
    at MacDuff, again revealing a patch of the alien<br>
    corpus. Riker and Worf both continue FIRING to keep<br>
    MacDuff away from the controls. MacDuff finally throws<br>
    back his head and screams --</p>
  <p>89 MACDUFF (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> falls to the floor, unconscious. The others stare<br>
    at him, relieved.</p>

  <p> The Enterprise at warp.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental. We<br>
    are on a course to Starbase Three-<br>
    zero-one. Doctor Crusher has been<br>
    working steadily, and has restored<br>
    the memories of most of the crew.</p>
  <p>92A INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker. Picard is sitting behind his desk.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Lysians have identified<br>
    &quot;Commander MacDuff&quot; as a Satarran<br>
    -- an alien race that's been at<br>
    war with the Lysians for decades.</p>
  <p> Picard stands, steps out from behind the desk.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've conveyed to the Lysians our<br>
    deepest regrets over the tragedy of<br>
    their lost ship and crew. They've<br>
    been extraordinarily understanding.</p>
  <p> Riker thinks for a moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    With all the power that MacDuff<br>
    had... to alter our brain<br>
    chemistry, and manipulate the<br>
    computers... it's hard to believe<br>
    he needed the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Satarran weapons technology is<br>
    no more advanced than the<br>
    Lysians'. One photon torpedo<br>
    would have ended their war.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conundrum&quot; - REV. 11/15/91 - ACT FIVE 66A.</p>
  <p>92A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It almost did...</p>
  <p> OFF the look between them.</p>
  <p>93 INT. TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> Business as usual. Riker ENTERS, glances around the<br>
    room and sees something that makes him stop cold.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conundrum&quot; - 11/14/91 - ACT FIVE 67.</p>
  <p>94 INCLUDE TROI AND RO</p>
  <p> sitting together at a table, immersed in a private<br>
    conversation.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts. He takes a deep breath to fortify<br>
    himself, then heads for the table.</p>
  <p> Troi and Ro see him coming, and their conversation<br>
    stops just a little too quickly.</p>
  <p> Riker arrives at the table. An awkward beat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I hope I'm not interrupting.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Not at all. I was hoping to see<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Please -- sit down.</p>
  <p> Uncomfortable, he sits. He never thought he'd have<br>
    to deal with them both at once. And what have they<br>
    been saying to each other?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well. I'm glad I ran into the<br>
    two of you...</p>
  <p> They smile sweetly, waiting for him to talk his way<br>
    into trouble. He launches in.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You know, when you have no memory<br>
    of who you are, or who anybody<br>
    else is...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Conundrum&quot; - REV. 11/18/91 - ACT FIVE 68.</p>
  <p>94 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (with feigned<br>
    sincerity)<br>
    The Counselor tells me... at<br>
    times like that, we might do things<br>
    we've always wanted to do.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (taken aback)<br>
    She said that?</p>
  <p> He glances uncomfortably at Troi, who gazes serenely at<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's psychologically valid.</p>
  <p> Riker is hard-pressed for a response. Ro extends the<br>
    uncomfortable moment, then stands.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (feigned sincerity)<br>
    Don't worry about it, Commander.<br>
    As far as I'm concerned we've<br>
    shared something that you and I<br>
    will treasure forever.</p>
  <p> Ro turns and walks off before Riker can respond.<br>
    Nonplussed, he looks at Troi. A beat, then Riker sits<br>
    down.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: Ro)<br>
    I feel kind of... confused.</p>
  <p> Troi can't suppress a smile.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If you still feel confused<br>
    tomorrow -- you know where my<br>
    office is.</p>
  <p> Troi smiles, gets up, and leaves. Riker is suddenly<br>
    alone. He lets out a long breath -- he's off the hook<br>
    for now...</p>
