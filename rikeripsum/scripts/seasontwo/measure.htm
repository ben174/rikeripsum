  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in route to Starbase one-seven-three.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 42523.7.<br>
    We are in route to newly<br>
    established Starbase one-seven-three for port<br>
    call. Crew rotation is scheduled,<br>
    and we will offload experiment<br>
    modules.</p>

  <p>3A INT. ENTERPRISE - DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> RIKER is seated shuffling cards. O'BRIEN, GEORDI and<br>
    DATA pulling out chairs. Data wears an eyeshade. Data<br>
    is almost into the chair when O'Brien stops him.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Hold it, that's my chair. My luck<br>
    is always lousy unless I start<br>
    on the dealer's left.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That would seem to be rank<br>
    superstition.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Bitter experience has taught me<br>
    it's a fundamental truth.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (slapping the cards down<br>
    in front of O'Brien<br>
    who cuts them)<br>
    The game is five card stud,<br>
    nothing's wild.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; - 12/14/88 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This game is exceedingly simple.<br>
    With only fifty-two cards,<br>
    seventeen of which I will see,<br>
    and four players there are a<br>
    limited number of possible winning<br>
    combinations.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There's more to it than just the<br>
    cards.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The bets will give an indication<br>
    of the relative strengths of each<br>
    hand.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (with a wink to Riker)<br>
    Time to pluck a pigeon.</p>
  <p> Riker deals the cards. Betting begins with O'Brien,<br>
    and proceeds around the table. The third card is<br>
    dealt. O'Brien and Geordi pass, Data and Riker bid.<br>
    Fourth card, more bids and passes. Fifth card. Bets<br>
    are placed. Riker grins.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I think I'm in trouble.</p>
  <p> He folds.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll raise five.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Too rich for me.</p>
  <p> He tosses his cards.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will raise you three.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Your three and five more.</p>
  <p> Data is becoming increasingly puzzled. He considers<br>
    his cards, Riker's cards, considers the pot, studies<br>
    Riker's face.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; - 12/14/88 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Is this what is known as the poker<br>
    face?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you playing or not?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will fold.</p>
  <p> Riker rakes in the chips, then turns over his cards<br>
    revealing a busted hand. Data turns his cards face<br>
    up. He held a winning hand.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You had nothing.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    He bluffed you, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It makes very little sense to bet<br>
    when you cannot win.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But I did win. I was gambling<br>
    that you wouldn't call.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But how can you tell?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Instinct, Data, instinct.<br>
    (he shuffles the cards)<br>
    The game is seven card high/low<br>
    with a buy on the last card. And<br>
    just to make it interesting the<br>
    man with the axe takes all.</p>
  <p> Data is looking completely bemused as the cards are<br>
    dealt.</p>

  <p>3D INT. STARBASE 173 - RESTAURANT</p>
  <p> It's very high tech. PICARD sits alone at a table.<br>
    Before him is a cup. He suddenly straightens in his<br>
    chair as a beautiful WOMAN in her late forties enters.<br>
    She is in a Starfleet uniform which clearly is a<br>
    surprise to Picard. She is very poised, very<br>
    professional, and she scans the room as if searching<br>
    for someone. Her eyes light on Picard; and a funny,<br>
    ironic little smile curves her lips. Picard rises and<br>
    walks up to the passway to join her.</p>
  <p>3E ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (with a little edge on<br>
    the words)<br>
    My God, if it isn't Phillipa<br>
    Louvois, back in uniform.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    Don't gloat, Picard. It's almost<br>
    more irritating then when you're<br>
    being self-righteous.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Unbelievable, after all this time,<br>
    and we're picking up the threads<br>
    of old fights as if we'd never<br>
    been apart.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    Ain't love wonderful.</p>

  <p>4 INT. STARBASE 173 - LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Phillipa and Picard standing on the pass-through.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What are you doing out here?</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    I'm in charge of the Sector<br>
    twenty-three JAG office. I'll<br>
    be making some good law.<br>
    (a rueful smile)<br>
    And maybe do a little good along<br>
    the way, too. What do you think?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Anything is possible. You<br>
    returned to Starfleet.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    I had to, it's the most exciting<br>
    and worthwhile place to be.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You didn't have to leave.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    They forced me out.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. That was your own damn<br>
    stubborn pride.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    (becoming heated)<br>
    When I prosecuted you in the<br>
    Stargazer court-martial I was<br>
    doing my job.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, you went way beyond doing the<br>
    job. You enjoyed it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; - 12/14/88 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    Not true! A court-martial is<br>
    standard when a ship has been<br>
    lost. I had a duty as an officer<br>
    in the Judge Advocate General.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Flummery, you've always enjoyed<br>
    the adversarial process more than<br>
    arriving at the truth.</p>
  <p> They both seem to realize that they are skating<br>
    dangerously close to very thin ice. They literally<br>
    physically turn away from each other while they recover<br>
    their tempers. Picard continues a little gruffly:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Well, I hope you've learned a<br>
    little wisdom.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    Watch it, you're doing it again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (forcing a smile, and<br>
    we see the tension<br>
    leech from his body)<br>
    I'm not being self-righteous.<br>
    Merely right.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    A distinction, I would submit,<br>
    without a difference.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come and sit down.</p>
  <p> As they walk down off the pass-through and seat<br>
    themselves she says:</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    I can't stay long. I'm meeting<br>
    someone for dinner.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But he hasn't arrived yet.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    What makes you think it's a man?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; - 12/14/88 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Past experience.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    Cute. Try to remember that you're<br>
    an officer and a gentleman.<br>
    (she rises)<br>
    You know, I never thought I would<br>
    say this, but it is good to see<br>
    you again. You're still a damn<br>
    sexy man, Picard.</p>
  <p> This rocks him back in his chair.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    (continuing; very brisk)<br>
    So buy me dinner.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I thought you were meeting<br>
    someone?</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL NAKAMURA enters. With him is BRUCE MADDOX.<br>
    They cross to the table.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    (struggling with<br>
    herself)<br>
    Once again you're always right,<br>
    Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> Phillipa whirls for a grand exit, and almost bumps<br>
    noses with Nakamura.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Admiral.</p>
  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    Captain Louvois. You're<br>
    acquainted with Captain Picard?</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    Yes, we're old... friends.</p>
  <p> Phillipa exits.</p>
  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    Captain, good to see you again.<br>
    May I present Commander Bruce<br>
    Maddox. He has an interesting<br>
    proposal for you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; - 12/14/88 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Nakamura and Maddox exchange glances.</p>
  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But that can wait until later.<br>
    I'm eager to see the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Picard looks from Nakamura to Maddox. Whatever this<br>
    &quot;proposal&quot; is, it is going to have import for himself<br>
    and his ship.</p>
  <p>4A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE</p>
  <p> as before, docked at Starbase one-seven-three.</p>
  <p>5 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker watches as Picard, Admiral Nakamura, and Maddox<br>
    BEAM ABOARD. SOUND EFFECT in the b.g. as Nakamura is<br>
    piped aboard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral, Commander Maddox, allow<br>
    me to introduce my first officer,<br>
    Commander William Riker.</p>
  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    Pleasure, Commander.</p>
  <p> They shake hands and begin walking toward the doors.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long has it been since we've<br>
    seen each other?</p>
  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    You'd just been assigned as an<br>
    ensign aboard the old Reliant.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    Oh yes, and I seem to remember<br>
    a certain young lieutenant who<br>
    had harsh words about snap<br>
    inspections, and the admirals who<br>
    pulled them.</p>
  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    The situation changes when you've<br>
    got the admiral's stripes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; - 12/14/88 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The party steps through the doors and into the<br>
    Enterprise corridor.</p>
  <p>6 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    There isn't an officer in<br>
    Starfleet who wouldn't give his<br>
    right leg to be where you are -- Captain<br>
    of the Starship<br>
    Enterprise. I'm no different.<br>
    I just have the power to get<br>
    aboard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Happy to have you, Admiral.</p>
  <p> They enter the turbolift.</p>
  <p>7 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Bridge. Congratulations on your<br>
    appointment. Command of a<br>
    Starbase.</p>
  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    Thank you, but I miss a ship.<br>
    A bit of advice, Captain. Don't<br>
    ever become an admiral. They make<br>
    you an administrator.</p>
  <p> They arrive, and step out onto the bridge.</p>
  <p>8 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Admiral on the bridge.</p>
  <p> On the bridge are Riker, WORF, Data, and WESLEY.<br>
    Everyone stiffens slightly, and looks around. Maddox<br>
    and Data lock eyes, and Data stands. Picard and<br>
    Nakamura converse as they tour the bridge. Riker<br>
    notices the by-play and frowns.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was a little surprised at the<br>
    decision to put a base in force<br>
    this close to the Neutral Zone.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; - 12/14/88 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    As you know, we've had disturbing<br>
    news from both sides of the zone.<br>
    We're here to respond as needed.<br>
    And it won't hurt to have the<br>
    Romulans know we're nearby.</p>
  <p> They complete their circuit of the bridge.</p>
  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Well, Captain, I thank you for<br>
    this opportunity. For five<br>
    hundred years ships who've borne<br>
    the name Enterprise have been a<br>
    legend. This one is no different.</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    (impatiently)<br>
    Admiral.</p>
  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    Oh yes, Captain. Commander Maddox<br>
    is here to do some work on your<br>
    android. Please take care of him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant Worf.</p>
  <p> He indicates and Worf escorts the admiral off the<br>
    bridge.</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    How have you been, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My condition does not alter with<br>
    the passage of time, Commander.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The two of you are acquainted?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    Yes, I evaluated Data when it<br>
    first applied to the Academy.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And were the sole member of the<br>
    committee to oppose my entrance<br>
    on the grounds that I was not a<br>
    sentient being.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; - 12/14/88 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What exactly will this work<br>
    entail?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    I'm going to disassemble Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (pausing for a beat to<br>
    assimilate this)<br>
    I think we will remove this<br>
    discussion to the lounge.</p>
  <p> Riker, Maddox, Data, and Picard walk to the doors.</p>
  <p>8A INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Everyone seated around the table.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Explain this procedure.</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    Ever since I first saw Data at<br>
    its entrance evaluation at<br>
    Starfleet Academy, I've wanted<br>
    to understand it. I became a<br>
    student of the works of Doctor<br>
    Noonien Soong -- Data's creator.<br>
    I've tried to continue his work,<br>
    and I believe I am very close to<br>
    the breakthrough which will enable<br>
    me to duplicate Soong's work and<br>
    replicate this.<br>
    (Maddox points to Data)<br>
    But as a first step I must<br>
    disassemble and study it. Data<br>
    is going to be my guide.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It sounds intriguing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How will you proceed?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; - 12/14/88 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>8A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    I'll run a full diagnostic on<br>
    Data, evaluating the condition<br>
    of its software. I'll then dump<br>
    its core memory into the starbase<br>
    mainframe computer and begin a<br>
    detailed analysis of its<br>
    construction.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You have constructed a positronic<br>
    brain?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Have you determined how the<br>
    electron resistance across the<br>
    neural filaments is to be<br>
    resolved?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    Not precisely.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That would seem to be a necessary<br>
    first step.</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    I'm confident that I'll have the<br>
    answer once I've examine the<br>
    filament links in your anterior<br>
    cortex.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But if the answer is not<br>
    forthcoming, your model will not<br>
    function.</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    I don't anticipate a problem.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You seem a little vague on the<br>
    specifics. What are the risks<br>
    to Commander Data?</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    His basic research lacks the<br>
    specifics necessary to support<br>
    an experiment of this magnitude.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data is a valued member of my<br>
    bridge crew. Based on what I've<br>
    heard I cannot allow him to submit<br>
    to your experiment.</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    I thought this might be your<br>
    attitude, Captain.<br>
    (he removes a message<br>
    disk from his pocket,<br>
    and extends it to<br>
    Picard)<br>
    Here are Starfleet's transfer<br>
    orders separating Commander Data<br>
    from the Enterprise, and<br>
    reassigning it to Starbase one-seven-three<br>
    under my command. Data, I'll<br>

  <p>9 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Admiral Nakamura on the screen. Picard eyes him with<br>
    some hostility.</p>
  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    Look, it's a transfer, like any<br>
    other transfer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, it's not. This is one of my<br>
    key officers, and he's been<br>
    removed without consulting me.</p>
  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    I'm sorry about that, but<br>
    Commander Maddox's work in<br>
    robotics is considered critical<br>
    by Starfleet Command. Think<br>
    what's at stake here. If<br>
    Commander Maddox can succeed in<br>
    duplicating Noonien Soong's work<br>
    other captains on other ships<br>
    would have the advantage you now<br>
    enjoy: a Data on every bridge.<br>
    You don't want Data transferred,<br>
    fine. There's an easy solution.<br>
    Have him work with Commander<br>
    Maddox. Nakamura out.</p>
  <p> Picard stares at the blank viewscreen, then rises and<br>
    paces the room. The DOOR CHIME SOUNDS arresting him in<br>
    his nervous preambulations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Data enters.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You sent for me, sir?</p>
  <p> Picard returns to his desk, seats himself, and regards<br>
    Data intently.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Please, sit down. We've got a<br>
    problem.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    I find myself in agreement with<br>
    that assessment of the situation,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your service to this ship has been<br>
    exemplary. I don't want to lose<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am pleased to hear you say so.<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There is a solution which presents<br>
    itself.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Undergo the procedure, then the<br>
    transfer order becomes moot.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will not submit to this<br>
    procedure.</p>
  <p> Picard rises, and seats himself on the corner of the<br>
    desk, closing the distance with Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, I understand your objections<br>
    to this procedure, but I also have<br>
    to consider Starfleet's interests.<br>
    If Commander Maddox is correct<br>
    there is a possibility that many<br>
    more beings such as yourself could<br>
    be constructed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    True, but possibility is a word<br>
    which can encompass any number<br>
    of outcomes -- good and bad.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But if he's right, Starfleet would<br>
    be immeasurably enriched.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, I am a Starfleet<br>
    officer. Can they force me to<br>
    do this?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's precisely because you are<br>
    a Starfleet officer that they can.<br>
    We take an oath to serve. In this<br>
    case this is the form your service<br>
    is taking.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, Lieutenant La Forge's eyes<br>
    are far superior to human<br>
    biological eyes, true?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then why are not all human<br>
    officers required to have their<br>
    eyes replaced with cybernetic<br>
    implants?</p>
  <p> Picard is utterly at a loss for words. We can see the<br>
    confusion on his face as he struggles for an answer to<br>
    this unanswerable remark. Data rises with great<br>
    dignity.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I see. It is precisely because<br>
    I am not human.</p>

    officer transfers.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>

  <p> Phillipa at her desk working. Picard enters. She<br>
    looks up in surprise.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    My God, twice in as many days.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I need your help.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    An historic moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've been trying to make heads<br>
    or tails of this gibberish, and<br>
    it's finally defeated me. My<br>
    android officer has been<br>
    transferred so he can undergo a<br>
    highly dangerous procedure. I<br>
    want to stop it.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    He can refuse to undergo this<br>
    procedure, but we can't stop the<br>
    transfer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Once Maddox has Data under his<br>
    control anything could happen.<br>
    I don't trust that man.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    We agree to certain risks when<br>
    we join Starfleet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (pacing)<br>
    Acceptable risks, justified risks,<br>
    yes, but I can't accept this.<br>
    It's unfair and unjust. What<br>
    about his rights...</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    All this passion over a machine.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (raising a warning<br>
    finger)<br>
    Don't start. Is there an option?</p>

  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    There's always an option. He can<br>
    resign.</p>
  <p> Phillipa suddenly rises and comes around the desk to<br>
    Picard. She is very close, her body language is one of<br>
    yearning, but her voice still has that flippant tone.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    So you came to me for help.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (stiff because he thinks<br>
    she's taunting him)<br>
    Yes, I came to you. You're the<br>
    JAG officer in this sector. I had<br>
    to come to you.</p>
  <p> He starts to leave.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    Wait! I didn't mean it that way.<br>
    I'm... I'm glad that you thought<br>
    you could... well, come to me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Trust is too painful a word.</p>

    I wish things were different for<br>
    us.</p>

  <p> Data is packing. A handgrip lies open on the desk top.<br>
    There is a holocube on the top to the clothing. Data<br>
    triggers it, and a miniature of Tasha Yar stands on the<br>
    desk. He regards the image for a few seconds, then<br>
    removes a box from a desk drawer. Opens it and studies<br>
    his medals. Places it in the case. Finally he lifts<br>
    an antique bound book. As he replaces the book,<br>
    Maddox enters. Maddox lifts out the book, finds a<br>
    marker at the sonnet, looks surprised.</p>

    little resemblance to the rules.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    That while I believe that you can<br>

    in the positronic brain, I do not<br>
    think you have acquired the<br>
    expertise necessary to preserve<br>

    Captain's log, supplemental.<br>
    Commander Bruce Maddox, having<br>
    been thwarted by Data's abrupt<br>
    resignation from Starfleet is now<br>
    seeking a legal remedy for his<br>
    woes. Captain Louvois has<br>
    requested my presence at those<br>
    discussions.</p>

    rigid with fury stands nearby. Phillipa is<br>
    expressionless listening to the arguments.</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Your response is emotional and<br>
    irrational. You're endowing Data<br>
    with human characteristics because<br>
    it looks human. But it's not.<br>
    If it were a box on wheels I<br>
    wouldn't be facing this<br>

    Overt sentimentalism is not one<br>
    of Captain Picard's failings.<br>

    If I'm permitted to make this<br>

    achievement become boundless.<br>
    Consider, every ship in the<br>
    Federation with a Data on board.<br>
    Utilizing their tremendous<br>
    capabilities. Acting as our hands<br>
    and eyes in dangerous situations.<br>
    That is worth a little<br>
    inconvenience.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    Look, you're preaching to the<br>
    choir here.<br>
    (touches her breast)<br>
    So why don't you get to the point?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    (palms flat on the desk<br>
    he leans in on her)<br>
    Data must not be permitted to<br>
    resign.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He's an officer in Starfleet.<br>
    He has certain rights...</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    Rights! Rights! I'm sick to<br>
    death of hearing about rights!<br>
    What about my right not to have<br>
    my life work subverted by blind<br>
    ignorance?</p>

    We have rule of law in this<br>
    Federation. You can't simply<br>
    seize people, and experiment with<br>
    them to prove your pet theories.</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    Now you're doing it. Data is an<br>
    extraordinary piece of<br>
    engineering, but it is a machine.<br>
    If you permit it to resign it will<br>
    destroy years of work in robotics.<br>
    Starfleet doesn't have to allow<br>

    Is Data?</p>

    its full stature.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I couldn't disagree more, but<br>
    we'll save that argument for<br>
    another day. Now listen<br>
    carefully. I didn't get you a<br>

    something far more valuable -- my<br>
    advice. You've spent years<br>
    in the womb of Starfleet. Now<br>
    you're about to start a new life.<br>
    You'd be wise to consider the<br>

    Oh yeah, I understand. I just<br>
    don't like your being forced out.<br>

    better, but can't stop himself. His anger is fueled by<br>
    his sense of loss -- his life work is crumbling before<br>
    his eyes because he believes that without Data he<br>
    cannot succeed. Thus his reputation is also on the<br>
    line.</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    I have a better idea. Carnival<br>
    work. They could bill you as the<br>
    walking encyclopedia. Ask him<br>
    any question --</p>

  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Number One, Captain Louvois has<br>
    called. We're expected in her<br>
    office. Meet me in Transporter<br>
    Room Five.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (touches his insignia)<br>
    On my way.<br>
    (to Maddox)<br>
    I know you're just leaving. I'll<br>

  <p>14 INT. JAG OFFICE</p>
  <p> Riker and Picard already there.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    I have completed my research,<br>
    and based on the Acts of Gould<br>
    passed in the early twenty-first<br>
    century, Data is the property of<br>
    Starfleet. He cannot resign and<br>
    he cannot refuse to cooperate with<br>
    Commander Maddox.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And if I challenge this ruling?</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    I will be required to hold a<br>
    hearing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then I so challenge. Convene your<br>
    hearing.</p>
  <p> Phillipa is taken aback. She was not prepared for<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; - 12/14/88 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    Captain, that would be exceedingly<br>
    difficult. This is a new base.<br>
    I have no staff --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Surely there are regulations to<br>
    cover this eventuality.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    There are. I can use serving<br>
    officers as legal counsel. You<br>
    as senior officer would defend.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And who gets the unenviable task<br>
    of prosecuting this case?</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    You do. The next most senior<br>
    officer aboard defendant's ship.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can't. I won't. Data's my<br>
    friend, my comrade. We've served<br>
    together and I not only respect<br>
    him, I have affection for him.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    This isn't about friendship. This<br>
    is about duty, and how we search<br>
    for truth.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A system that pits people against<br>
    each other can't be the answer.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    When people of good conscience<br>
    have an honest dispute we<br>
    sometimes must resort to this kind<br>
    of adversarial system.</p>

  <p>14 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You want me to try and prove that<br>
    Data's a mere machine. I can't.<br>
    I don't believe it. I know he's<br>
    more than that. I'm neither<br>
    qualified nor willing to do this.<br>
    You're going to have to find<br>
    someone else.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    Then I'll rule summarily based<br>
    upon my findings. Data's a<br>
    toaster. Have him report to<br>
    Commander Maddox immediately for<br>
    experimental refit.</p>
  <p> Silence holds the room. Phillipa cold, implacable.<br>
    Riker stricken. Picard weighing, measuring, evaluating<br>
    his First Officer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (bitterly)<br>
    I see I have no choice but to<br>
    agree.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    Good. But you better do your duty<br>
    in that courtroom. If I think<br>
    for one minute that you're not<br>
    giving me your best effort I'll<br>
    end this right then and there.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You don't have to remind us of<br>
    our duty. Just remember yours.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>

    I've never forgotten it. Not<br>
    then, and certainly not now.</p>

    resign.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I see... from limitless options<br>
    I am reduced to none, or rather<br>
    one. I can only hope that<br>
    Commander Maddox is more capable<br>
    than it would appear.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, you're not going to submit.<br>
    We're going to fight this.<br>
    Captain Louvois may be overly<br>
    attached to the letter of the law,<br>
    but she has not forgotten its<br>
    spirit. She's convening a hearing<br>
    and we are going to lay the<br>
    question of your legal status to<br>
    rest once and for all.<br>
    (he rises, and paces<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Care to try your hand, Number<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (exchanging blows with<br>
    his opponent)<br>
    This isn't about you and me.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Isn't it? Data may be the issue,<br>

    be judged.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (exchanging several<br>

    That's the nature of the<br>

    opponents are of equal ability.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (turning very slowly,<br>
    leaning on his sword<br>
    and regarding Riker)<br>
    Are you suggesting that we are<br>
    not evenly matched?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, but for Data's sake it has<br>
    to be said. I've been forced into<br>
    this, and I have only one option.<br>
    To give this my best effort.</p>

    All right, I'm going to need to<br>
    know everything about you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, all of that information is<br>
    stored in the Enterprise computer<br>
    banks.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    earlier, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard rises and takes a turn around the room. Returns<br>
    to the desk, and begins to play unconsciously with the<br>
    objects in the travelcase.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I need to know how you think,<br>
    what you want, how you feel. What<br>
    drives you, motivates you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Drives? Motivates? Sir, may I<br>
    inquire as to the purpose of this<br>
    line of questioning?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have to prove that you're a<br>

  <p> DATA<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's not what I need to hear.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    How can we deny the obvious?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're searching for an argument<br>
    which will legally deny that<br>
    obvious fact.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stop babbling.<br>

    of his fast-tattering<br>
    patience)<br>
    The law recognizes many things<br>

    of flesh and blood. It's a little<br>
    legal fiction, you see.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am beginning to understand why<br>
    Shakespeare wrote, let us kill<br>

  <p> Riker is suddenly arrested by something he sees on a<br>

    he realizes he now has the means to win this case.<br>

    A human?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you. Data, what is the<br>
    capacity of your memory, and how<br>
    fast can you process information?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have an ultimate storage<br>

    great thickness.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Your honor, I offer into evidence<br>
    prosecution's exhibit A. A bar<br>
    of plasteel with a tensile<br>

  <p> Phillipa inspects the exhibit, and hands it back to<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Commander Data, would you please<br>
    bend that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (again on his feet)<br>
    Objection, your honor. Many races<br>
    possess meta-human strength. It's<br>
    not relevant to the issue before<br>
    this court.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    I'm afraid I can't agree, Captain.<br>
    Proceed with the demonstration,<br>
    Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> Data easily bends the bar. Phillipa again inspects<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Phillipa)<br>
    Drawing on the log record of the<br>
    construction of the prototype<br>
    android Lore, also constructed<br>
    by Noonien Soong, I request that<br>
    I be allowed to remove Commander<br>
    Data's hand for your inspection.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Objection! What is the point of<br>
    all this?</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    The issue before this court is<br>
    whether Data is machine, and by<br>
    extension property. I'd say this<br>
    is pretty damn relevant.</p>
  <p> Riker removes Data's hand.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (sotto voce to Data)<br>
    I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> Riker offers it to Phillipa who inspects it. Hands it<br>

  <p>20 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Data is a physical representation<br>
    of a dream, an idea conceived of<br>
    by the mind of a man. His<br>
    purpose? To serve human needs<br>
    and interests. He is a collection<br>
    of neural nets and heuristic<br>
    algorithms. His responses are<br>
    dictated by an elaborate software<br>
    program written by a man. The<br>
    hardware<br>
    (slapping the hand<br>
    against his palm)<br>
    was built by a man.</p>
  <p> Riker has been preambulating around the courtroom, each<br>
    step bringing him closer to Data. He is now at his<br>
    side, and without warning he leans down, presses the<br>
    switch, and turns him off. Data collapses like a<br>
    broken toy.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And this man has turned him off.<br>
    Pinocchio is broken, the strings<br>
    are cut.</p>
  <p> Riker lays the hand down next to Data. Shocked silence<br>
    fills the room. Picard's reaction -- shock and<br>
    certainty that he cannot win.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I request a recess.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    Granted.</p>

  <p>21 INT. TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> The lounge is deserted, lights very low creating the<br>
    implication that it is very late. Picard is seated at<br>
    a table facing out the windows. An empty glass stands<br>
    before him. He is turning it, turning it, turning it.<br>
    His expression is death weary and very sad. GUINAN<br>
    is at the bar puttering, but never taking her eyes off<br>
    that solitary figure. Finally she can stand it no<br>
    longer. Drawing two drinks she slides from behind the<br>
    bar and crosses to him.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You should get some sleep.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've lost, and I'm not even sure<br>
    I mind. Data is a machine. But<br>
    there is something bothering me.<br>

    just wounded pride that I've lost<br>
    and in front of her.</p>

    Ancient history.</p>

    the future.</p>

    he decides to tell her.<br>
    It emerges in sharp<br>

  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    Phillipa was assistant to the<br>
    prosecution. She dug up every<br>
    obscure case and citation and the<br>
    panel hammered at me for three<br>
    days. It damn near ended my<br>
    career. It did end us. She's<br>
    enjoying this situation. She<br>
    knows I disapprove of the<br>
    adversarial system. Now she's<br>
    forced me into active<br>
    participation, and she's both<br>
    pleased and angered to see me fail.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Emotions. They're such slippery,<br>
    contradictory things. It's a<br>
    wonder any of us ever crawled out<br>
    of the oceans, or swung down out<br>
    of the trees.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (pushing back his chair)<br>
    Well, there's only one thing to<br>
    do. I go to her in the morning,<br>
    and we discuss a deal.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (thoughtfully studying<br>
    her hands)<br>
    I had heard a lot about you before<br>
    I joined the Enterprise. About<br>
    how Picard was a man who never<br>
    knew when to lie down and admit<br>
    he was beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have to salvage at least some<br>
    of Data's rights. If Data agrees<br>
    to undergo Commander Maddox's<br>
    procedure we can get out of this<br>
    hearing before he's declared the<br>
    property of Starfleet command.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    If Commander Maddox is successful<br>
    in disassembling and reassembling<br>
    Data, what has he gained?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The ability to build another.<br>
    A hundred others, a thousand.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE 42.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    To do what?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Explore for us. Enter the<br>
    dangerous situations.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    All those future Datas risking<br>
    their lives for the people who<br>
    created them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (very intent)<br>
    You said something earlier about<br>
    decisions today.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Having implications for the<br>
    future.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Precedent! This case will set<br>
    the precedent for all the future<br>
    Datas. It will determine their<br>
    status, and they'll all be<br>
    property.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    There is an ancient word for it -- slavery.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (very excited)<br>
    Not a word we want back in our<br>
    vocabulary.</p>
  <p> They each lift a glass and toast each other.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Good luck, sir.</p>
  <p> They drink.</p>
  <p>22 INT. COURTROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Everyone in their original positions.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE 43.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (making his opening<br>
    statement)<br>
    Commander Riker has dramatically<br>
    demonstrated to this court that<br>
    Lieutenant Commander Data is a<br>
    machine. Do we deny that? No.<br>
    But how is this relevant? We too<br>
    are machines, just machines of<br>
    a different type. Commander Riker<br>
    has continually reminded us that<br>
    Data was built by a human. We<br>
    do not deny that fact. But again<br>
    how is it relevant? Does<br>
    construction imply ownership?<br>
    Children are created from the<br>
    building blocks of their parents'<br>
    DNA. Are they property? We have<br>
    a chance in this hearing to<br>
    severely limit the boundaries<br>
    of freedom. And I think we<br>
    better be pretty damn careful<br>
    before we take so arrogant a step.<br>
    I call Lieutenant Commander Data<br>
    to the stand.</p>
  <p> Data returns to the witness stand. Picard pulls from<br>
    beneath the table the android's travelcase. Places it<br>
    on the table, opens it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing; lifts out<br>
    the case of medals,<br>
    and displays the<br>
    contents)<br>
    What are these, please?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My medals.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why pack them? What logical<br>
    purpose do they serve?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I... I do not know, sir. None<br>
    I suppose. I just wanted them.<br>
    Is that vanity?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE 44.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (holding up the book<br>
    of sonnets)<br>
    And this?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It was a gift from you, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You value it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is a reminder of friendship<br>
    and service.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (lifts out the holocube,<br>
    and triggers it; Tasha<br>
    stands before them)<br>
    And this? You have no portraits<br>
    of any other of your crewmates.<br>
    Why this person?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I would prefer not to answer that<br>
    question, sir. I gave my word.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, may I remind you, that<br>
    you are under oath.<br>
    (more gently now)<br>
    And under the circumstances, I<br>
    don't think Tasha would mind.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (swallowing convulsively<br>
    several times)<br>
    She was important to me... we<br>
    were... intimate.</p>
  <p> Phillipa is literally rocked back in her chair.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have no further questions of<br>
    this witness.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE 45.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    Commander Riker, do you wish to<br>
    cross?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I have no questions, your honor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I call to the stand Commander<br>
    Bruce Maddox as a hostile witness.</p>
  <p> Riker and Maddox confer, then with a shrug Maddox seats<br>
    himself in the witness chair.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Verify, Maddox, Bruce, Commander.<br>
    Current assignment, Chair of<br>
    Robotics, Federation Institute<br>
    of Technology. Major papers...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Enough. Suffice it to say, he's<br>
    an expert.<br>
    (right up in his face)<br>
    Commander Maddox, it is your<br>
    contention that Data is not a<br>
    sentient being and therefore not<br>
    entitled to those rights reserved<br>
    for all other life-forms in this<br>
    Federation?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    Data is not sentient, no.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why, Commander?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    Because Data is a piece of<br>
    outstanding engineering and<br>
    programming.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is required for sentience?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    Intelligence, self awareness,<br>
    consciousness.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you know what sentience is,<br>
    Commander?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE 46.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Excellent. Then you can enlighten<br>
    the rest of us.</p>
  <p> All of Picard's delivery needs to be sharp and<br>
    staccato.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing; right in<br>
    Maddox's face)<br>
    Prove to this court that I'm<br>
    sentient.</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    (to Phillipa)<br>
    This is absurd!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why? Because you can't do it?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    No, it's just pointless. We all<br>
    know you're sentient.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So I'm sentient, but Data isn't?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    That's right.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    Well... well, you're self aware.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah, the second ingredient. But<br>
    let's deal with the first<br>
    requirement. Is Data<br>
    intelligent?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE 47.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    It has the ability to learn and<br>
    understand, and to cope with new<br>
    situations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Like this hearing. What about<br>
    self awareness. What does that<br>
    mean? Why am I self aware?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    Because you are conscious of your<br>
    existence and actions. You're<br>
    aware of yourself and your own<br>
    ego.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, what are you doing now?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am taking part in a legal<br>
    hearing to determine my rights<br>
    and status. Am I property or<br>
    person?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And what's at stake?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My right to choose. Perhaps my<br>
    very life.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My rights. My status. My right<br>
    to choose. My life. He seems<br>
    pretty damn self aware to me.<br>
    Well, Commander Maddox, I'm<br>
    waiting.</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    This is exceedingly difficult...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you like Data?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    (completely taken aback)<br>
    I don't know it well enough to<br>
    like or dislike it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But you admire him?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (6)</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    Oh yes, it's an outstanding --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Piece of engineering and<br>
    programming. Yes, you've said<br>
    that. You've devoted your life<br>
    to the study of cybernetics in<br>
    general?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And Data in particular?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And now you're proposing to<br>
    dismantle him.</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    So I can rebuild him and construct<br>
    more!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How many more?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    Hundreds, thousands. There's no<br>
    limit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And do what with them?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    Use them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    As effective units on Federation<br>
    ships. As replacements for<br>
    humans in dangerous situations.<br>
    So much is closed to us because<br>
    of our fragility. But they...</p>

  <p>22 CONTINUED: (7)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting; he picks<br>
    up an object and throws<br>
    it down a disposal<br>
    chute)<br>
    Are expendable.</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    It sounds harsh but to some<br>
    extent, yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you expendable, Commander<br>
    Maddox? Never mind. A single<br>
    Data is a curiosity, a wonder,<br>
    but a thousand Datas, doesn't that<br>
    become a new race? And aren't<br>
    we going to be judged as a species<br>
    about how we treat these<br>
    creations? If they're expendable,<br>
    disposable, aren't we? What is<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    What? I don't understand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What... is... he?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    (angry now and hostile)<br>
    A machine!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is he? Are you sure?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    Yes!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But he's met two of your three<br>
    criteria for sentience, and we<br>
    haven't addressed the third. So<br>
    we might find him meeting your<br>
    third criterion, and then what<br>
    is he?</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    (driven to his limit)<br>
    I don't know. I don't know!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>22A ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Reaction shot from Phillipa.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He doesn't know.<br>
    (to Phillipa)<br>
    Do you? That's the decision<br>
    you're facing. Your honor, a<br>
    courtroom is a crucible. In it<br>
    we burn away the egos, the selfish<br>
    desires, the half-truths, until<br>
    we're left with the pure product<br>
    -- a truth -- for all time.<br>
    Sooner or later it's going to<br>
    happen. This man or others like<br>
    him are going to succeed in<br>
    replicating Data. And then we<br>
    have to decide -- what are they?<br>
    And how will we treat these<br>
    creations of our genius? The<br>
    decision you reach here today<br>
    stretches far beyond this android<br>
    and this courtroom. It will<br>
    reveal the kind of a people we<br>
    are. And what<br>
    (points to Data)<br>
    ... they are going to be. Do you<br>
    condemn then to slavery?<br>
    Starfleet was founded to seek out<br>
    new life.<br>
    (indicating Data)<br>
    Well, there he sits, your honor,<br>
    waiting on our decision. You have<br>
    a chance to make law. Well, let's<br>
    make a good one. Let us be wise.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    This case touches on metaphysics,<br>
    and that's the province of<br>
    philosophers and poets. Not<br>
    confused jurists who don't have<br>
    the answers. But sometimes we<br>
    have to make a stab in the dark,<br>
    and speak to the future. Is Data<br>
    a machine? Absolutely. Is he<br>
    our property? No... (this will<br>
    be rewritten with additions).</p>
  <p> The courtroom erupts in joy. Phillipa starts to leave<br>
    then crosses to Picard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>22A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You see, sometimes it works.</p>
  <p> Picard watches her walk away, conflicting emotions<br>
    washing across his face.</p>
  <p>22B ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Data walks to Maddox who is looking confused, guilty<br>
    and sad.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Continue your work, Commander,<br>
    and when you are ready I will<br>
    still be here.</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    You'd be willing after what I've<br>
    put you through?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, it would be a less lonely<br>
    universe if there were more of<br>
    my kind.</p>
  <p> Phillipa comes up unnoticed by Data and Maddox.</p>
  <p> MADDOX<br>
    (watching Data walk<br>
    away)<br>
    He's remarkable.</p>
  <p> PHILLIPA<br>
    You didn't call him &quot;it.&quot;</p>
  <p> Maddox looks startled, then smiles.</p>
  <p>23 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker sitting alone in the darkness staring out the<br>
    windows as the stars rush past. Data enters. Riker<br>
    does not turn.</p>

    Sir, there is a celebration on<br>
    the Holodeck.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I have no right to be there.</p>

    Because you failed in your task?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    No, God, no. Data, I came this<br>
    close to winning.</p>

    Yes, sir.</p>

    remembering)<br>
    I could have cost you your life!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (moving in, and seating<br>
    himself opposite Riker)<br>
    Yes, that is true, but<br>
    Commander... Will, I have learned<br>
    from your experience.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What could you have possibly<br>
    learned from this kind of ordeal?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That at times one must deny their<br>
    nature, sacrifice their own<br>
    personal beliefs to protect<br>
    another. Is it not true that had<br>
    you refused to prosecute, Captain<br>
    Louvois would have ruled summarily<br>
    against me?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That action injured you, and saved<br>
    me. I will not forget.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (taking his hand)<br>
    You're a wise man, my friend.</p>

    Not yet sir, but with your help<br>
    I am learning.</p>
