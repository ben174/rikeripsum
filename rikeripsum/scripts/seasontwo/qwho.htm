  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise as it is traveling at impulse speed.</p>
  <p>2 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE MAIN ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> GEORDI is coming down the corridor, he sees a young twenty<br>
    five to twenty eight year old ensign -- who has<br>
    newly arrived on the Enterprise. She is very<br>
    energetic, and enthusiastic in an open and ingenuous<br>
    way, which is both appealing and refreshing. Her name<br>
    is SONYA. She is standing in front of a food dispenser<br>
    panel.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    Hot chocolate, please.</p>
  <p> The hot chocolate appears.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We don't ordinarily say &quot;please&quot;<br>
    to food dispensers.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    (amused)<br>
    Since it's listed as &quot;intelligent<br>
    Circuitry&quot;, why not? After all,<br>
    working as much with artificial<br>
    intelligence as we do, can be<br>
    dehumanizing -- right? So, maybe<br>
    we can combat that tendency with<br>
    a little simple courtesy.</p>
  <p> She removes the cup of hot chocolate.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> They walk toward Main Engineering.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Who?&quot;-2/28/89 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    For someone who has just arrived,<br>
    you certainly aren't shy with your<br>
    opinions.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    Ooops -- have I been talking too<br>
    much?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Who?&quot; - 2/24/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    (the words come out in<br>
    a rush)<br>
    I do tend to be a motor mouth,<br>
    especially when I get excited...<br>
    and you don't know how exciting<br>
    it is to get this assignment.<br>
    Everyone in class -- and I mean<br>
    everyone -- wants the Enterprise.<br>
    I mean, it would have been all<br>
    right to spend some time on Ranuos<br>
    Six to do phase work with<br>
    anti-matter... that's my<br>
    speciality.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I know -- that's why you got this<br>
    assignment.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    (off Geordi's smile)<br>
    Did it again. It's just that...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I know, you're excited. Sonya.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't think you want to bring<br>
    that hot chocolate around these<br>
    control stations.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    Sorry. I shouldn't even have this<br>
    in engineering. We were talking<br>
    and I just forgot I had it in my<br>
    hand...</p>
  <p> And as she turns to take it out of the room.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'll finish it over here.<br>
    (looks back, and<br>
    seriously)<br>
    Lieutenant La Forge, it won't<br>
    happen again.</p>
  <p> Then as she turns around she crashes right into CAPTAIN<br>
    PICARD.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Who?&quot; - 2/24/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2A PICARD</p>
  <p> The cup full of chocolate hits him right in the chest.</p>
  <p>2B SCENE</p>
  <p> For a moment everyone freezes. Geordi starts forward.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Actually it's my fault, sir...</p>
  <p> He looks down at his soiled uniform.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, I'm aware of how often you<br>
    order picnics to be held in here.</p>
  <p> Sonya is about to die from embarassment.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    Oh no. Oh, Captain... I'm<br>
    sorry... oh..<br>
    (she tries to brush it<br>
    off)<br>
    ... I wasn't looking and...<br>
    (she pulls her hand<br>
    away)<br>
    Oh.. It's all over you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Ensign. It's all over me.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    At least let me...</p>
  <p> In trying to brush it off, she just makes it worse.<br>
    She looks up at Picard, who through it all is<br>
    maintaining as much of his dignity as possible.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign... ah...</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    (she straightens up to<br>
    her best military<br>
    posture)<br>
    Ensign Sonya Gomez.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK &quot;Q Who?&quot;-2/28/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>2B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Ensign Gomez is a recent Academy<br>
    graduate. She transferred on at<br>
    Starbase one seventy three.</p>
  <p> Picard's attention is on the widening chocolate stain<br>
    that Sonya is creating.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign...<br>
    (restraining her)<br>
    I think it would be simpler if<br>
    you let me change my uniform?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, I really have to accept<br>
    responsibility for this.</p>
  <p> Picard has been looking from one to the other,<br>
    beginning to understand what is happening between<br>
    Geordi and Sonya.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Chief Engineer. I believe<br>
    I do understand now.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    I'm very excited about this<br>
    assignment Captain, and I promise<br>
    I'll...<br>
    (she looks at the<br>
    chocolate stain on<br>
    Picard's uniform)<br>
    ... try very hard to serve you and<br>
    this ship to the best of my<br>
    ability.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure you will. Carry on.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Who?&quot; - 3/2/89 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>2B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard then turns and strides off.</p>
  <p>2C SONYA AND GEORDI</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    First impressions right. Isn't<br>
    that what they say -- first<br>
    impressions are the most<br>
    important.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll give you this... it's a<br>
    meeting the captain won't soon<br>
    forget.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    What a way to start my first<br>
    assignment.</p>
  <p> Off Geordi's reaction:</p>
  <p>3 OMMITTED (3)</p>
  <p>4 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard walks past a crewman -- who notices the stain on<br>
    his uniform, but quickly averts his eyes so as not to<br>
    embarrass the captain. Picard turns and enters the<br>
    turbolift.</p>
  <p>4A INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> The doors close.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Deck nine. Officers' quarters.</p>
  <p> The turbolift moves off. Then stops. The doors open,<br>
    and while still looking down at the stain on his<br>
    uniform, Picard steps off.</p>
  <p>4B INT. SHUTTLE</p>
  <p> Picard is not in a corridor of the Enterprise -- he's on<br>
    a shuttle! He turns around and the turbolift doors are<br>
    gone.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Who?&quot; - 2/24/89 - TEASER 5A.</p>
  <p>4C SCENE</p>
  <p> He looks up. There is a crewman at the controls.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Crewman? What's going on?</p>
  <p> The crewman turns.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Who?&quot;-2/27/89 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>4D CREWMAN</p>
  <p> It's Q.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    There, there, my dear captain.</p>
  <p>4E PICARD</p>
  <p> Reacts.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Q.</p>
  <p>4F SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard moves closer to Q.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (re: the stain)<br>
    My, my -- haven't we been careless.</p>
  <p> Q passes his hand over the stain on Picard's uniform<br>
    and the stain disappears.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    There -- a little cleaning service.<br>
    I am more than happy to provide.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We agreed you would never trouble<br>
    my ship again!</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I always keep my arrangements,<br>
    sir. We are nowhere near your<br>
    vessel.</p>
  <p> Picard looks out and sees a field of stars. Then back<br>
    to Q.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise moving along at impulse speed.</p>
  <p>5A INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Geordi and Sonya are walking to Ten-Forward. She is<br>
    in a clean uniform.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I read your graduating thesis.<br>
    I wouldn't have requested you if<br>
    you weren't the best.</p>
  <p> She's uncomfortable with the compliment and shrugs it<br>
    off, changes the subject.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    Where are we going?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    To Ten-Forward. We're going to<br>
    forget about work. We are going<br>
    to sit, talk, relax, look at the<br>
    stars. You're going to learn to<br>
    slow down.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    (very intense)<br>
    No, that's the one thing I can't<br>
    do.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (gently)<br>
    You're awfully young to be so<br>
    driven.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Who?&quot; - 3/2/89 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p>5A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    Yes, I am. I had to be. I had<br>
    to be the best because only the<br>
    best get to be here. Out here<br>
    on the edge.<br>
    (gripping his arm and<br>
    giving it a shake)<br>
    Geordi, Geordi . . .uh . .<br>
    (dropping the arm<br>
    abruptly)<br>
    Lieutenant --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (grinning)<br>
    Geordi</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    Geordi. Whatever is out here<br>
    we're going to be the first<br>
    humans ever to see it. And is<br>
    it here because we believe in<br>
    it and have therefore created<br>
    it, or has it created us?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The Grand Unified Theory and<br>
    Supersymmetry hasn't been<br>
    seriously discussed for years.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    They also haven't been disproved.<br>
    I don't know if it's true or<br>
    not, but I've got to try and find<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You're more than a scientist<br>
    you're a philospher.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    No, no, I'm not. Oh, God, don't<br>
    make me sound profound. There's<br>
    just so much out there ... here.</p>
  <p> She is gesturing broadly as if somehow she can pull<br>
    in and embrace the whole universe.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I have to see it all. To<br>
    understand it all, and we haven't<br>
    got much time.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Who?&quot; - 3/2/89 - ACT ONE 7B.</p>
  <p>5A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sonya, it's going to be there for<br>
    you. Believe me.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    I promise, I won't let anything<br>
    exciting slip past without letting<br>
    you know.</p>
  <p>6 INT. TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> GUINAN is behind the bar. There are a few n.d. crewmembers<br>
    scattered around the room. The only one of our<br>
    regulars in Ten-Forward is Geordi, who is sitting at<br>
    a table by the window with Sonya they are engaged<br>
    in a very animated conversation.</p>
  <p>6A GUINAN</p>
  <p> Something gives her pause -- like a whisper only she<br>
    can hear. She is thoughtful for a beat...</p>
  <p>6B SCENE</p>
  <p> Guinan steps out from behind the bar and crosses to<br>
    the center of the room.</p>
  <p>6C ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> She stands near Geordi's table for a beat and gazing<br>
    out at space. In the background Geordi continues his<br>
    conversation with Sonya.</p>
  <p> GEORDI (O.S.)<br>
    I understand that you're excited<br>
    -- so was I. This is your first<br>
    assignment, everything is new,<br>
    you are eager and that's great,<br>
    but...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Who?&quot; - 3/2/89 - ACT ONE 7C.</p>
  <p>6C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SONYA (O.S.)<br>
    I've always been an enthusiastic<br>
    person, but...</p>
  <p> He holds up his hand.</p>
  <p> GEORDI (O.S).<br>
    Do me a favor... for a minute,<br>
    just listen.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Who?&quot; - 2/24/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>6C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SONYA (O.S.)<br>
    I always do that. Someone nice<br>
    -- and you are nice I can tell,<br>
    goes out of their way to give me<br>
    some helpful advice... and I'm<br>
    so busy talking...</p>
  <p> In the b.g. we see Geordi quiet her with a gesture.</p>
  <p> SONYA (O.S.)<br>
    Not another word. Go ahead...<br>
    talk.</p>
  <p>6D GUINAN</p>
  <p> Her brow knits -- like she has just seen the first<br>
    indications of a coming storm. She steps to a<br>
    communications panel.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Bridge, this is Ten-Forward.</p>
  <p>7 INT. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING RIKER</p>
  <p> Who reacts to the unusual call.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Guinan?! I don't believe you've<br>
    ever called the bridge before.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I've never felt the need. Is<br>
    everything alright?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How do you mean?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Is there... anything... unusual<br>
    happening?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (looks around)<br>
    Anyone notice anything unusual?<br>
    (waits, then)<br>
    No Guinan, nothing out of the<br>
    ordinary. Why do you ask?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Who?&quot; - 2/24/89 - ACT ONE 8A.</p>
  <p>7A ANGLE IN TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> A thoughtful Guinan responding.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Who?&quot; - 3/1/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>7A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I'm... I'm not certain. Just a<br>
    feeling -- something that happened<br>
    once before. Probably nothing.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Please forget I called. Ten-<br>
    Forward out.</p>
  <p> She turns and stares out into space.</p>
  <p>8 OMITTED</p>
  <p>9 INT. SHUTTLECRAFT</p>
  <p> Picard is in the shuttlecraft -- with Q. Picard<br>
    adjusts a control; Q smiles.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    The locator beacon won't help.<br>
    They'll never look for you this<br>
    far away.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to the com controls.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Enterprise -- this is Picard.</p>
  <p> There's no response.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stop this foolishness, Q. Return<br>
    me to the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I'd suggest you change your<br>
    attitude. Petulance does not<br>
    become you. We have business.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Keeping me a prisoner out here<br>
    will not force me to discuss<br>
    anything with you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Who?&quot; - 2/24/89 - ACT ONE 9A.</p>

    It will in time, my dear Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK &quot;Q Who?&quot;-2/28/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>10 INT. TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> Guinan steps up to near the table occupied by Geordi<br>
    and Sonya and looks out at the stars.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    I appreciate your advice,<br>
    Lieutenant. And, I'll take it<br>
    to heart.</p>
  <p> Geordi notices Guinan's distraction.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Guinan?</p>
  <p> She turns.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Can I get you something?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No -- we're fine. Is everything<br>
    all right?</p>
  <p> She looks over at Geordi for a beat then.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I don't know.</p>
  <p> But her expression belies the answer. Geordi nods,<br>
    but something about her reaction causes him to:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (gets up)<br>
    I think I'll go check out<br>
    Engineering.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>

    None other.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Picard, if you had half the sense<br>
    you pretend to have, you would<br>

    than pleased to expedite her<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    You know him.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    We had some dealings.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Those dealings were two centuries<br>

    she appears to be. She's an imp<br>
    -- where she goes trouble always<br>

    Guinan? Is that your name now?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Guinan's not the issue here -- you<br>
    are... We had an agreement that<br>
    you would stop meddling with us.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    And so I have.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What do you want, Q? State your<br>
    business and let's get on with<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I agree Captain, enough about this<br>
    creature -- she's diverting us from<br>
    the purpose of my being here.</p>
  <p> RIKER (O.S.)<br>
    Which is?</p>
  <p> Q looks up.</p>
  <p>21A SCENE</p>

    Ahh, the redoubtable Commander<br>
    Riker. And micro-brain.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Growl for me -- let me know you<br>
    still care.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (returning to the point)<br>
    My purpose? Why to join you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    To join us as what?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Q Who?&quot; - REV. 3/7/89 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>21A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    A member of the crew. Willing<br>
    and able -- ready to serve.</p>
  <p> Before Riker can react.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    This ship is already home for the<br>
    indigent, the unwanted and the<br>
    unworthy -- so why not a homeless<br>
    entity.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Homeless?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So, the other members of the Q<br>
    continuum kicked you out.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Not all of the Q are like this<br>
    one. Some are almost respectable.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Join us as what? To do what?<br>
    Would you start as an ordinary<br>
    crewman -- what task is too menial<br>
    for an entity?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Do you mock me?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not at all. That is the last<br>
    thing I would do. You, by<br>
    definition are part of our<br>
    charter. Our mission is to go<br>
    forth -- to seek out new and<br>
    different life forms, and you<br>
    certainly qualify as one of the<br>
    most unique life forms I have<br>
    ever encountered. To learn more<br>
    about you is frankly quite<br>
    provocative, but you are next<br>
    of kin to chaos.</p>

  <p>21A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Captain, at least allow me to<br>

  <p> Q takes Picard's silence as permission to continue.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    After our last encounter,<br>
    (a look to Riker)<br>
    I was asked to leave the Q<br>
    continuum. Since then, I have been<br>
    wandering vaguely -- bored really<br>
    -- my existence without purpose.<br>
    Then, I remembered the good times<br>
    I had with you...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The good times!? The first time<br>
    we met you put us on trial for<br>
    the &quot;crimes of humanity&quot;...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Of which you were exonerated.</p>

  <p>21A CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The next time we saw you, you<br>
    asked me to join the Q continuum.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You made a large mistake in not<br>
    accepting my offer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... and now you say you want to<br>
    join us.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Yes, more and more I realize that<br>
    here -- here is where I want to<br>
    be. Think of the advantages.<br>
    Now, I neither expect nor require<br>
    any special treatment. If<br>
    necessary, although I can't<br>
    imagine why, I will renounce my<br>
    powers and become as weak and<br>
    incompetent as all of you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Oh, come on, Captain, in<br>
    fairness... let me try, I deserve<br>
    at least that much.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Fairness?! You disrupt this ship<br>
    -- kidnap the captain!</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I add a little excitement, a<br>
    little spice to your lives and<br>
    all you do is complain. Where's<br>
    your adventurous spirit -- your<br>
    imagination. Think, Picard, of<br>
    the possibilities.</p>

    Simply stated -- we don't trust<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Oh, you may not trust me, but you<br>
    do need me. You're not prepared<br>
    for what awaits you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know that we are prepared,<br>
    but I do know that we are ready<br>
    to confront it.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Really?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Absolutely. That's why we are<br>
    out here.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Oh, the arrogance.<br>
    (to Guinan)<br>
    They don't have a clue about<br>
    what's &quot;out here&quot;.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    They will learn -- adapt. That's<br>
    their great advantage.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    They are moving faster than<br>
    expected -- farther than they<br>
    should.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    By whose calculation?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You judge yourselves against the<br>
    pitiful adversaries you have so<br>
    far encountered -- the Klingons,<br>
    the Romulans, are nothing compared<br>
    to what's waiting.<br>

    Picard, you are about to move into<br>
    areas of the galaxy containing<br>
    wonders more incredible than you<br>
    can possibly imagine... and<br>
    terrors to freeze your soul. I<br>
    offer myself as guide -- only to<br>
    be rejected out-of-hand.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I guess we'll just have to get<br>
    along the best we can without you.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    What justifies this smugness?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're not smug -- nor arrogant.<br>
    We are resolute and we are<br>
    willing. But more than that we<br>
    are determined. Your help is not<br>

    It is a biped -- a cyborg. Part organic and part<br>
    artificial. There is a metal like device implanted in<br>
    its head. One arm is artificial with a tool like<br>
    contraption instead of a hand. The other organic<br>
    except for the hand. Its eyes are artificial. Its<br>
    presence triggers RED ALERT.</p>

  <p> Picard, Worf, and security team enter. The Borg is<br>
    still making a visual survey of the room. It seems<br>
    to look right through or pass the people as if they<br>
    are of no consequence.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He came right through the shields!</p>
  <p> Picard approaches. Q appears behind Picard -- to offer<br>
    sotto voice observations.</p>
  <p> Q<br>

  <p> The Borg strides toward one of the com panels.</p>

    Understand you? You are nothing<br>

    Lieutenant Worf.</p>
  <p> Worf motions for one of his security team to intercept<br>

  <p> The phaser hit has no affect on the Borg. He, or it,<br>
    steps to the com panel and affixes the apparatus on his<br>

    Worf -- use whatever means to<br>

  <p> This phaser hit rips into the Borg knocking him away.<br>
    Before anyone can react -- another Borg materializes.<br>
    Worf and the others assume a defensive posture. The<br>

  <p> This Borg responds differently. The hit is absorbed.<br>
    He is apparently surrounded with a force field of some<br>
    kind. This Borg goes to the back panel. He accesses<br>
    the computer -- drains it.</p>
  <p> Then walks over to the first Borg -- removes some parts<br>
    from his body and de-materializes. After a beat the<br>
    dead Borg withers into a line of ash -- which then<br>
    disappears.</p>

    interconnected through these slots<br>
    and are working collectively.</p>

  <p> Steps over to examine an empty Borg slot.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Each slot is designed for a<br>
    specific Borg. Here is where the<br>
    connection is made.<br>

    of arm rest)</p>
  <p>52C SCENE</p>
  <p> Riker moves over to join Data -- while Worf stands<br>
    guard. They are very tense -- at any moment the Borg<br>
    could leave the slots.</p>

    Speed being the obvious one. This<br>
    ship literally thinks what it<br>
    wants to do and it happens.</p>
  <p> SUDDENLY a nearby Borg leaves its slot. The away team<br>
    assumes a defensive posture expecting an attack.<br>
    Instead the Borg moves to a panel, executes a<br>
    program, the purpose of which we do not know. Then, as<br>
    the away team watches, the Borg returns to its slot.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Fascinating. Obviously they also<br>
    function individually.</p>

    From the looks of it the Borg are<br>
    born as biological life form.<br>
    Almost immediately after birth<br>
    they begin getting artificial<br>

    developed the technology to link<br>
