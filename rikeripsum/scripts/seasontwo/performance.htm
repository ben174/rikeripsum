    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Shuttle coming in.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 42923.7.<br>
    We are en route to the Braslota<br>
    System, site of the first<br>
    Starfleet battle simulation.<br>
    Joining the Enterprise as observer<br>
    and mediator is the Zakdorn Master<br>
    Strategist, Sirna Kolrami.<br>
    Despite misgivings, I have agreed<br>
    to Starfleet's request that we<br>
    take part in these wargame<br>
    exercises.</p>
  <p>2 OMITTED</p>
  <p>3 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> DATA is at Command, supernumeraries at Conn and OPS,<br>
    and WORF and ENSIGN BURKE confer at Tactical. All<br>
    heads turn as the forward turbolift opens and RIKER and<br>
    KOLRAMI, a slender weasel-like creature, ENTER and<br>
    cross to the Observation Lounge.</p>
  <p>3A INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (rising, extending his<br>
    hand)<br>
    Mister Kolrami -- Captain Jean-Luc<br>
    Picard. Welcome aboard.</p>
  <p> KOLRAMI<br>
    Captain. I bring greetings from<br>
    those at Starfleet Command.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Peak Performance&quot; - REV. 4/21/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Would you care to be shown to your<br>
    quarters?</p>
  <p> KOLRAMI<br>
    I require little rest, Captain.<br>
    I would prefer to commence our<br>
    mission.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker share a glance -- &quot;pushy little guy,<br>
    isn't he?&quot;</p>
  <p>3B INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Worf crosses to Data.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Despite their reputations, this<br>
    Zakdorn does not appear to be a<br>
    very formidable warrior.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In the game of military<br>
    brinksmanship, individual<br>
    physical prowess is less<br>
    important than the perception of<br>
    a species as a whole. For over<br>
    nine millennia potential foes have<br>
    regarded the Zakdorns as having<br>
    the greatest innately strategic<br>
    minds in the galaxy.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    And no one is willing to test that<br>
    perception in combat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Exactly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Then the reputation means nothing.</p>
  <p>4 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> A magnificent view of the galaxy surrounds them as they<br>
    take their seats at one end of the table. Kolrami keys<br>
    the screen, and the DIAGRAM of a solar system appears.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Peak Performance&quot; - 4/18/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KOLRAMI<br>
    The Braslota System. In orbit<br>
    around the second planet is the<br>
    eighty-year old Starcruiser,<br>
    Hathaway.<br>
    (nodding at Riker)<br>
    He is still your choice?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander Riker will captain the<br>
    Hathaway.</p>
  <p> KOLRAMI<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    You will have forty-eight hours<br>
    to ready the vessel before the<br>
    Enterprise attacks.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And we'll be experiencing actual<br>
    battle conditions?</p>
  <p> KOLRAMI<br>
    Correct. Engineering will<br>
    disconnect the Enterprise's<br>
    weapons and link the system with<br>
    the modified laser-pulse beam.<br>
    All &quot;hits&quot; will be recorded<br>
    electronically. If the computer<br>
    registers &quot;damage,&quot; it will react<br>
    accordingly -- shutting down the<br>
    affected areas for the appropriate<br>
    &quot;repair&quot; time. Additional<br>
    questions?</p>
  <p> Riker and Picard share a look and shake their heads.</p>
  <p> KOLRAMI<br>
    Captain Picard, I understand that<br>
    you initially resisted Starfleet's<br>
    request for this simulation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> KOLRAMI<br>
    May I know why?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Peak Performance&quot; - REV. 4/25/89 - TEASER 3A.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Starfleet is not a military<br>
    organization. Our purpose is<br>
    exploration.</p>
  <p> KOLRAMI<br>
    Then why am I here?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Because with the Borg threat,<br>
    I have decided that my officers<br>
    and I need to hone our tactical<br>
    skills.</p>
  <p> (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Peak Performance&quot; - REV. 4/21/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    In a crisis situation, it is<br>
    prudent to have several options.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I still prefer brains over brawn.<br>
    (to Kolrami)<br>
    I think it's a waste of<br>
    effort to test our combat skills<br>
    -- it's a minor province in the<br>
    make-up of a starship captain.</p>
  <p> KOLRAMI<br>
    Your objection is noted. Let us<br>
    hope your distaste for the<br>
    exercise will not affect your<br>
    strategic abilities.</p>
  <p> There is a moment as Riker absorbs the words and the<br>
    underlying contempt with which they were delivered.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Kolrami, when I agree to<br>
    do a thing. I do it.<br>
    (to Picard, lighter)<br>
    Care to surrender now, Captain?</p>
  <p> Picard gives Riker a warm, small smile, then looks to<br>
    Kolrami as if to say, &quot;see what a hell of a fellow he<br>
    is?&quot; Off their various expressions --</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Peak Performance&quot; - 4/17/89 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE</p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Plying deep space at impulse.</p>
  <p>6 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Data, PULASKI, and Kolrami are<br>
    present. Supernumeraries at Conn and Ops. Burke at<br>
    Tactical.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, Number One, you are allowed<br>
    a complement of forty. Select<br>
    whom you will. Save Data, who<br>
    will serve as my first officer<br>
    in your absence.</p>
  <p> Before Riker can respond, Kolrami jumps in -- leaving<br>
    Pulaski slightly taken aback by his rudeness.</p>
  <p> KOLRAMI<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I had envisioned you defining the<br>
    crew.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On my ship, the leader of an away<br>
    team has total control of the<br>
    mission. If you want to judge<br>
    &quot;leadership&quot; -- why not start at<br>
    the beginning?</p>
  <p> Kolrami sagaciously nods his assent, eyeing Picard as<br>
    if he, too, were under scrutiny.</p>
  <p> KOLRAMI<br>
    Very well, Captain.</p>
  <p> With a curt bow, he glides to the turbolift and<br>
    disappears.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    My, what a charmer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (admonishingly)<br>
    Now, Doctor...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Peak Performance&quot; - REV. 4/20/89 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Captain, he needs an attitude<br>
    adjustment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Zakdornian culture is replete<br>
    with self-assuredness and<br>
    confidence. It is seldom<br>
    undeserved. For example, Kolrami<br>
    is a third level grand master at<br>
    the game of Strategema.</p>
  <p> Fine, but it doesn't make Pulaski feel any better.</p>
  <p>7 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Geordi and an ASSISTANT toil at aligning the warp<br>
    engine's dilithium chamber.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (giving directions)<br>
    Another millimeter... little<br>
    more... there! Excellent.</p>
  <p> RIKER (O.S.)<br>
    Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> Geordi straightens to find Riker looking on.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You've heard of the simulation<br>
    aboard the Hathaway?</p>
  <p> As they talk, Goerdi takes Riker on a walking tour of<br>
    Engineering, checking &quot;this&quot; here, tweaking &quot;that&quot;<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, sir, and the best of luck<br>
    to you. I've researched the old<br>
    Avidyne engines -- archaic by our<br>
    standards, very touchy.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Anticipating the worst, do you<br>
    think it can be whipped into shape<br>
    in forty-eight hours?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Peak Performance&quot; - 4/18/89 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Geordi stops walking and hefts a tool kit.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (smiling broadly)<br>
    I've taken the liberty of packing<br>
    a few necessities.</p>
  <p> At this, Riker breaks into a grin, also.</p>
  <p>8 INT. ENTERPRISE - WORF'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> The room has been modified into a Klingon haven. The<br>
    lighting is subdued with a ruddy overtones. There is<br>
    a powerful scupture of a Klingon man, bare to the waist<br>
    taming a horse-like beast with a long snaking neck, and<br>
    two twisted horns springing from above each eye.</p>
  <p> Worf is seated at his desk working on a model of an<br>
    antique Klingon sailing vessel.</p>
  <p> A CHIME signals someone is at the door.</p>
  <p> It startles Worf, and he breaks the masts on his ship.<br>
    A rumble of fury.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Enter!</p>
  <p> The door opens and Riker steps in, looking around<br>
    curiously. This is his first time in here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Am I disturbing you?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Just finishing, Commander.</p>
  <p> Worf opens a drawer, and sweeps the ship into it.<br>
    Shuts it firmly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    &quot;Interesting&quot; quarters.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Peak Performance&quot; - 4/17/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You know of the simulation. What<br>
    do you think?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Waste of time.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's just designed to be an<br>
    exercise.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Useless. If there is nothing to<br>
    lose -- no sacrifice -- then there<br>
    is nothing to gain.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (playing him)<br>
    You mean -- besides &quot;pride.&quot;<br>
    (caught his attention)<br>
    Well, it's a good thing in this<br>
    case, because I probably don't<br>
    have a chance.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (alien concept)<br>
    There is always a chance.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Slim. The Hathaway's most<br>
    sophisticated weapon-systems --<br>
    even in a computer mock-up --<br>
    can't hope to defeat the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Still...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf... when you're out-gunned,<br>
    out-manned, and out-equipped --<br>
    what else do you have left?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (long beat)<br>
    Guile.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Join me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Peak Performance&quot; - 4/17/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The honor is to serve.</p>
  <p> Riker allows himself another smile -- this crew is<br>
    pulling together nicely.</p>
  <p>9 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Zooming along at impulse.</p>
  <p>10 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS to find Picard in the Command Chair, Data<br>
    to his right, Pulaski on his left, Wesley at Conn,<br>
    Burke at Tactical, and Kolrami examining Science One.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Begin long-range scanning of all<br>
    sectors within three light years<br>
    of Braslota.<br>
    (seeing Riker)<br>
    How is your crew shaping up?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's complete, but I would like<br>
    to request an addition.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (playing along)<br>
    Anyone in mind?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    With your permission, I would like<br>
    Acting Ensign Crusher aboard for<br>
    educational observation.</p>
  <p> Picard nods. Riker, in turn, gives Wesley a &quot;c'mon&quot;<br>
    head move. Wesley's enthusiasm can hardly be muted as<br>
    he leaps from the Conn -- to be quickly replaced by<br>
    a CREWPERSON.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (as if an afterthought)<br>
    Oh... since we have some time<br>
    before reaching Braslota --<br>
    (deferentially to<br>
    Kolrami)<br>
    I was hoping that you would agree<br>
    to play me in a game of Strategema.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Peak Performance&quot; - REV. 4/24/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KOLRAMI<br>
    Although I am intrigued by the<br>
    audacity of your request, I can't<br>
    fathom why you wish the encounter.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I enjoy a challenge.</p>
  <p> KOLRAMI<br>
    Very well, an opponent of &quot;limited<br>
    dimensions&quot; can often be quite<br>
    diverting.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p>11 INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - TRACKING</p>
  <p> Geordi and Riker on their way to Ten-Forward.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So you're going to beat him?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Nope.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Oh, then it's going to be a close<br>
    one.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But you have got a chance?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Nah.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (a little sarcastic)<br>
    Are you planning to show up?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sure, Kolrami is the best at<br>
    Strategema. To even get to play<br>
    him is a privilege.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Peak Performance&quot; - REV. 4/25/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Other than you being privileged,<br>
    is there anything else I can<br>
    look forward to?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Nope.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    This is going to be exciting.</p>
  <p>12 INT. ENTERPRISE - TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> Riker and Kolrami are seated at opposite ends of a<br>
    large table. Worf helps Riker prepare for the game<br>
    while Troi performs the same function for the Zakdorn.</p>
  <p>13 ANGLE - GEORDI, DATA AND PULASKI</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Against an opponent of approximate<br>
    skill -- Strategema can last well<br>
    over one thousand moves.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I wouldn't bet on us being here<br>
    that long.</p>
  <p>13A ANGLE ON WORF AND RIKER</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (confiding to Riker)<br>
    I have wagered heavily in the<br>
    ship's pool that you will take<br>
    him past the sixth plateau.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Peak Performance&quot; - REV. 4/21/89 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>13A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What if I don't?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will be... irritated.</p>

    Doctor, there are other ways to<br>

    Yeah, Data, I'd like to see your<br>
    neural-flecks tear him down a peg.</p>

    awesome spectacle even to those who have seen it<br>
    before.</p>
  <p> Wondrous! Gases swirl, pinpoints move, grids bend and<br>

  <p> Data becomes aware of all other eyes on the bridge<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    But I have expressed no such<br>
    interest.</p>
  <p> Pulaski hurries down to join them. She knows that<br>
    Data's honesty is about to blow her beautiful plan.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    What Commander Data means is that<br>
    he would never have had the nerve<br>
    to ask you himself, but I know<br>
    he is very interested in pitting<br>
    his skill against yours.</p>
  <p> Data has learned enough about humans to know this is a<br>
    moment to keep his mouth shut.</p>
  <p> KOLRAMI<br>
    Play a machine? Why should I wish<br>
    to?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I don't blame you. It's no fun<br>
    going into a game when you know<br>
    you're going to lose.</p>
  <p> KOLRAMI<br>
    But I wouldn't lose, and now<br>

    (an aside to himself,<br>
    but loud enough for<br>

  <p> Though irritated, Picard holds his tongue --</p>
  <p>39 INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING - TIGHT ON ANTI-MATTER<br>
    CONTAINMENT DEVICE</p>
  <p> The magnetic chamber is round, about the size of a<br>
    human head -- a clear orb with a snowball-sized piece<br>
    of anti-matter suspended in the center. Long,<br>
    intricately-cabled pieces of clear tubing extend out<br>
    from opposite sides of the orb -- generating the force<br>
    which keeps the anti-matter from escaping and wreaking<br>
    havoc. Attached to the end of the tubes are<br>
    finger-friendly handles.</p>
  <p> TWO VERY CAREFUL HANDS now wrap themselves around these<br>
    grips. WIDEN to reveal Wesley -- in the company of<br>
    Ensign Burke -- delicately maneuvering the orb from<br>
    his personal experimental station.</p>
  <p> Throughout this scene Wesley is talking just a little<br>
    too much. Nervous chatter as he tries to cover that<br>
    he's doing a naughty. Burke is equally anxious to be<br>
    back on the bridge.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I can't believe I forgot about<br>
    this. Good lesson not to let<br>
    excitement cloud your thinking.</p>
  <p> BURKE<br>
    Yeah.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    This is really delicate ... I<br>

  <p> BURKE<br>
    That's too bad. Look, is this<br>
    going to take much longer?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I have to dispose of it safely...<br>
    This is really volatile... I<br>
    better beam it off the Enterprise<br>

    Having studied William Riker's<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    In what regard?</p>
  <p> KOLRAMI<br>
    His record is exemplary, but as<br>
    you well know, a starship captain<br>
    is not manufactured -- he, or she,<br>
    is born from inside -- from the<br>
    character of the individual.<br>

  <p> KOLRAMI<br>
    We shall see if your faith is well<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    The test is if a crew will follow<br>

  <p>79 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> with the now dark Hathaway IN TOW VIA TRACTOR-BEAM.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental. With<br>
    the transporter repaired and my<br>
    crew safely back aboard, we have<br>
    officially ended the first<br>
    Starfleet battle simulation.</p>
  <p>80 OMITTED</p>
  <p>81 RIKER AND PULASKI AS THEY ENTER TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> where the atmosphere is anything but relaxed -- the<br>
    place is near bedlam. It takes Riker and Pulaski a<br>
    moment to absorb what is happening.</p>
  <p>82 DATA AND KOLRAMI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> are once again playing Strategema surrounded by a<br>
    surging VOCAL CROWD -- including Worf, Geordi, Wesley,<br>
    Troi and Burke. Riker does a double-take as he gapes<br>
    at the --</p>
  <p>83 DIGITAL COUNTER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> which now rips through the 26,000 mark! Before Riker<br>
    can blink, 27,000 rolls over! Even Pulaski can sense<br>
    the magic of the moment.</p>
  <p>84 THE ANDROID AND THE ALIEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> sit ramrod-straight as their fingers and heads twitch<br>
    and rock with incredible speed. 33,000. 34,000.<br>
    35,000. The counter stops at 35,693! Kolrami tears<br>
    his fingers free and goggles off.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Peak Performance&quot; - 4/19/89 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>85 SCENE</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Why have you suspended the game?</p>
  <p> Kolrami is beside himself with anger, humiliation,<br>
    self-doubt and confusion. He doesn't know whether to<br>
    drop dead or order pizza.</p>
  <p> KOLRAMI<br>
    (shaking with rage)<br>
    Because this is not a rematch --<br>
    you have made a mockery of me.</p>
  <p> He storms out of Ten-Forward with an urgency that could<br>
    only be borne of public disgrace.</p>
  <p>86 DATA</p>
  <p> is swarmed by the CHEERING CREW. Riker and Pulaski<br>
    push their way through to join Worf, Geordi, Wesley and<br>
    Troi in the inner-circle.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, you beat him!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, sir -- it is a stalemate.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No game of Strategema has ever<br>
    gone this high.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What did you do?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I simply altered my &quot;premise&quot; for<br>
    playing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Explain.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Working under the assumption that<br>
    Kolrami is attempting to win, it<br>
    is reasonable to assume that he<br>
    expects me to play for the same<br>
    goal.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You weren't?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Peak Performance&quot; - 4/19/89 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>86 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No. I was playing only for a<br>
    standoff -- a &quot;draw.&quot; While<br>
    Kolrami was dedicated to winning,<br>
    I was able to pass up obvious<br>
    avenues of advancement and settle<br>
    for a balance.<br>
    (android pride)<br>
    Theoretically, I should be able<br>
    to challenge him indefinitely.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Then you have beaten him.</p>
  <p> Data demurring, but with a little preen.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A matter of perspective. In the<br>
    strictest sense I did not win.</p>
  <p> Troi and Pulaski lean in close with a &quot;Come on, cut<br>
    the bull-stuff&quot; attitude.</p>
  <p> TROI/PULASKI<br>
    Data!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I busted him up.</p>
  <p> The CROWDED ROOM ERUPTS once again, and amidst the<br>
    congratulatory noise and the outstretched hands of<br>
    patting approval, PUSH IN on Data's satisfied<br>
    expression as he absorbs this new sensation, and --</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
