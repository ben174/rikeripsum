  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> slows to sub-warp speed, moving forward on impulse.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 42609.1.<br>
    In response to a desperate plea<br>
    for aid by my old friend, Captain<br>
    Donald Varley of the USS Yamato,<br>
    I am running a grave risk and<br>
    taking the Enterprise into the<br>
    Neutral Zone.</p>
  <p>2 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM</p>
  <p> PICARD at his desk, scanning a screen of data,<br>
    schematics of the Galaxy Class starships, as:</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This rendezvous is necessitated<br>
    by dangerous malfunctions which<br>
    are plaguing our sister ship.<br>
    Perhaps with both crews working<br>
    together we will be able to<br>
    eliminate the problem -- before<br>
    we are detected by the Romulans.</p>
  <p> He taps a touchpad, turning off the screen.</p>
  <p>3 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The Ready Room doors open and Picard steps onto the<br>
    bridge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Crusher -- how long to<br>
    rendezvous?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Contagion&quot; - 01/04/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>4 VARIOUS ANGLES AS NEEDED</p>
  <p> WESLEY, WORF, and TROI are at their stations. RIKER<br>
    is at Science One with DATA. Picard crosses to his<br>
    seat.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Four minutes, thirty-three<br>
    seconds, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Status of download, Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Entire Yamato log will be in our<br>
    computer by rendezvous.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Have you nailed down our little<br>
    hiccup yet?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The odd reading.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No. It might be due to the<br>
    problems currently being<br>
    experienced by the Yamato.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Trouble, Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm not sure, sir.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    We are alone out here?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, sir. There are no other<br>
    vessels in the area except the<br>
    Yamato.<br>
    (checks his panel)<br>
    Which is coming into viewer range<br>
    now.</p>
  <p> Riker takes his seat next to Picard. Data moves back<br>
    to his station.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Contagion&quot; - REV. 01/10/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>5 COMMAND AREA AND VIEWSCREEN - ANGLES AS NEEDED<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The screen displays a majestic view of the approaching<br>
    USS Yamato, a twin of the Enterprise. Picard and Riker<br>
    rise and move toward the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Transmission from the Yamato,<br>
    Captain -- on visual.</p>
  <p> On screen is CAPTAIN DONALD VARLEY, about Picard's age,<br>
    but brawnier and white-haired. He is standing near<br>
    the executive officer's chair. To either side of him<br>
    are two crewmembers who are inspecting an open panel<br>
    which shows scorch marks and scattered isolinear chips.<br>
    A third crewmember crosses in the foreground.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Donald, what's a nice Starfleet<br>
    Captain like you doing in a place<br>
    like this?</p>
  <p> VARLEY<br>
    It's good to see you, Jean-Luc,<br>
    despite your antique humor. I<br>
    only hope your people can help<br>
    us. The malfunctions are becoming<br>
    serious. We lost an engineering<br>
    team when the computer shut down<br>
    the forcefield in an open shuttle<br>
    bay. Eighteen people.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker exchange a look of shock.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And no idea what's causing these<br>
    problems?</p>
  <p> VARLEY<br>
    None. They are affecting every<br>
    system simultaneously. It's like<br>
    the ship has suddenly decided to<br>
    fall apart.<br>
    (a forced little laugh)<br>
    It's beginning to make me think<br>
    we should have run these Galaxy<br>
    Class ships across a few more<br>
    drawing boards before we built<br>
    one.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you suggesting it's a design<br>
    flaw?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Contagion&quot; - REV. 01/10/89 - TEASER 3A.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Varley is a man under intense pressure who is burying<br>
    it deep. He's had to call on an old friend for help.<br>
    He feels helpless and frightened. He has also<br>
    committed a major offense by entering the Neutral Zone.<br>
    He's talking a little off the top of his head.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Contagion&quot; - REV. 01/10/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> VARLEY<br>
    I don't know. I'm grasping at<br>
    straws here. All I know is that<br>
    we've got to get it fixed, and<br>
    before I lose more than an<br>
    engineering team.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (urgently)<br>
    Do you wish to evacuate<br>
    non-essential personnel to the<br>
    Enterprise?</p>
  <p> VARLEY<br>
    No... that would be premature.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Donald, we'll get our teams to<br>
    work. I'm sure neither of us<br>
    feels too comfortable sitting<br>
    around the Neutral Zone.</p>
  <p> VARLEY<br>
    I know what you're thinking, what<br>
    the hell am I doing here? Well,<br>
    I had heard rumors about a couple<br>
    of archaeological digs that<br>
    started making the Iconians sound<br>
    a lot less like legend. I did<br>
    a little investigating, and I<br>
    located their homeworld.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In the Neutral Zone.</p>
  <p> VARLEY<br>
    In the Neutral Zone.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Don, this was quite a risk to<br>
    run just to satisfy an<br>
    archaeological curiosity.</p>
  <p> VARLEY<br>
    No, the risk would be in allowing<br>
    the Romulans to locate Iconia.</p>
  <p> The viewer image of Varley breaks up in STATIC, fading<br>
    for a beat, then returns.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Contagion&quot; - REV. 01/10/89 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> VARLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Fortunately, I got there first.<br>
    It's a virtually dead planet, but<br>
    enough of the technology remains<br>
    to give the Romulans an edge if<br>
    they were ever to find it.</p>
  <p> During Varley's speech, more break-up occurs.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Don, your transmission is breaking<br>
    up.<br>
    (rising, then to Data)<br>
    Clean that up.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (tensely)<br>
    Sir, there is an energy build-up<br>
    in the Yamato's engineering<br>
    section.</p>
  <p> Picard whirls back to face the screen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yamato, this is the Enterprise,<br>
    come in Yamato.</p>
  <p> More STATIC.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Magnetic seals in the antimatter<br>
    chamber decaying!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain. Don!</p>
  <p> The viewer image of Varley BURSTS INTO A BLINDING WHITE<br>
    FLASH. PULL BACK to show the Yamato exploding.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Shields up!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Contagion&quot; - 01/04/89 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>6 INT. MAIN BRIDGE AND VIEWSCREEN - VARIOUS ANGLES<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The bridge crew reflexively shield their eyes. The<br>
    flash subsides, and the viewscreen defaults to a<br>
    forward view of space and a barrage of fiery objects,<br>
    hurtling toward the ship. KLAXONS SIGNAL RED ALERT as<br>
    the objects batter the Enterprise. The ship is<br>
    pounded (SFX) and shakes violently.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir!</p>
  <p> Worf is staring at the viewscreen. Picard and Riker<br>
    follow his gaze and stared, stunned, as the Yamato's<br>
    saucer section, engulfed in flames and explosions,<br>
    sails past, narrowly missing the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    Sensors indicate no life readings<br>
    from the Yamato's saucer section.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (looks up from his<br>
    instruments)<br>
    Captain! Another vessel coming<br>
    into sensor range.<br>
    (ominously)<br>
    It is Romulan.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Contagion&quot; - REV. 01/09/89 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>7 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> On the Main Viewer is the Romulan battle cruiser.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental. The<br>
    Yamato's entire crew and their<br>
    families, more than a thousand<br>
    people, have been lost.</p>
  <p> Data is at Ops. Wesley is at the Conn station. Riker<br>
    is seated at his normal position. End on Picard as he<br>
    finishes the log.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Circumstances, unfortunately,<br>
    permit us no pause for grief.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No response from the Romulan<br>
    vessel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Arm phasers and prepare to lock<br>
    on target.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Did they attack the Yamato?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Unknown, sir.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    All their weapons systems have<br>
    been fully activated. Still no<br>
    response.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (upward glance; then,<br>
    sternly)<br>
    Romulan vessel, this is Captain<br>
    Picard of the USS Enterprise.<br>
    Explain your illegal presence in<br>
    the Neutral Zone --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Contagion&quot; - 01/04/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>8 VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> He is interrupted by an UNFAMILIAR FEMALE VOICE.<br>
    Picard faces the image of the SUB-COMMANDER. She is<br>
    seated in what we assume to be her command position on<br>
    the Romulan bridge.</p>
  <p> TARIS<br>
    Explain yours!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you responsible for the<br>
    destruction of the Yamato?</p>
  <p> TARIS<br>
    No. And believe me, Captain, had<br>
    we chosen to exercise our right<br>
    to defend the Neutral Zone, we<br>
    would not have stopped with one<br>
    starship. You will leave at<br>
    once.</p>
  <p> Picard makes a slashing gesture to Worf who cuts the<br>
    com.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (looking to his bridge<br>
    crew)<br>
    Comments?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    She is extremely anxious --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Understandable if she just<br>
    destroyed a Federation starship.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Your scan was inconclusive. We<br>
    can't be sure of what happened<br>
    to the Yamato.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Our presence in the Neutral Zone<br>
    is provocative. It could force<br>
    her to respond.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Contagion&quot; - 01/04/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Open com. We will comply when<br>
    we have determined the cause of<br>
    the Yamato's destruction. And<br>
    when we are fully satisfied that<br>
    you were not responsible. Picard<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> The Romulan response is to disappear.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They are engaging their cloaking<br>
    device.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Good. They can't fire when<br>
    they're cloaked.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Unless they have overcome that<br>
    deficiency. The Yamato was<br>
    destroyed while they were cloaked.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Forget the Romulans. I want to<br>
    know what happened to the Yamato.<br>
    Number One, assemble the staff<br>
    for a conference in one hour.<br>
    And I want answers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p>9 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> stationary, holding in space.</p>
  <p>10 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Riker, Data, Worf, and GEORDI are present. Geordi<br>
    stands by a screen containing a schematic of the<br>
    Yamato and a blow-up of the affected engineering<br>
    section. There is a pulsing red dot in the engine<br>
    area.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Contagion&quot; - REV. 01/06/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (pointing)<br>
    Sensor recordings reveal that what<br>
    we witnessed was an uncontrolled<br>
    and catastrophic matter/antimatter<br>
    mix. The magnetic seals between<br>
    the chambers collapsed --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's not possible.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, sir, it is, but a highly<br>
    improbable series of events has<br>
    to take place before such an<br>
    occurrence can result.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Explain.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    In the event of a breach of seal<br>
    integrity there is an emergency<br>
    release system which dumps the<br>
    antimatter.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Apparently such a dump began, was<br>
    then halted, and the containment<br>
    seals were dropped. There was<br>
    still sufficient antimatter<br>
    present to lead to the result we<br>
    observed.</p>
  <p> They all look back to the schematic where that deadly<br>
    red dot is still pulsing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then there is no evidence that<br>
    a weapon was used?</p>
  <p> Troi enters and moves to a chair. Seats herself.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm sorry I'm late. I was with<br>
    the children. They have been<br>
    deeply affected by the Yamato's<br>
    destruction.</p>
  <p> There is a beat while they consider the cost in human<br>
    terms of this tragedy.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Contagion&quot; - REV. 01/06/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Evidence of a weapon? No, sir,<br>
    none.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    However it happened, the Yamato<br>
    did it to herself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Theorize. What do you think<br>
    caused this catastrophic<br>
    malfunction?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (looking very grim)<br>
    I think Captain Varley may have<br>
    been correct. There could be<br>
    a design flaw.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    In a Galaxy Class starship?</p>
  <p> Murmurs and physical reactions of consternation from<br>
    the officers. Picard is stone faced, unmoved.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, sir. It's the most<br>
    complicated piece of machinery<br>
    ever built. Something could have<br>
    been overlooked.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Knowing where the flaw is located,<br>
    do you think you can isolate and<br>
    solve the problem?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We're working on it now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Pull any and all personnel who<br>
    might be useful to your task.</p>
  <p> They rise, ready to scatter to their assigned tasks.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Contagion&quot; - REV. 01/06/89 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    If we have established that the<br>
    Romulans were not responsible for<br>
    the destruction of the Yamato,<br>
    would it not be prudent for us<br>

    Doctor Ramsey to allow me to carry<br>
    away my own little piece of legend<br>
    from the archaeological dig on<br>
    Denius Three. My engineers have<br>
    examined it, but are completely baffled<br>
    by the technology. What was its<br>
    purpose? I'm like a caveman<br>
    confronted by a tricorder. I'm<br>
    certain this device is Iconian.<br>
    But how far had it travelled<br>
    before it was abandoned on an<br>

    the hands of the Romulans, we<br>
    might as well dock our ships<br>
    and defend ourselves with sticks.</p>

    It is infuriating to be stopped<br>
    at the threshold of a dream by<br>

    If his people can't help us repair<br>

    China was thought to be only a<br>

  <p>29A INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> PULASKI chews out one of her medical staff. Sickbay<br>
    is a scene of orderly chaos. The single remaining<br>
    doctor is bouncing between three patients, the readouts<br>
    on the biobeds are going crazy.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    The biobeds aren't working.<br>
    The ship's falling apart and<br>
    you're wasting my time about<br>
    biobeds? I've got thirty-five<br>
    emergency calls scattered across<br>
    twelve decks and my trauma teams<br>
    are being run ragged trying to<br>
    respond.<br>
    (almost to herself,<br>
    flinging up her hands)<br>
    Biobeds!</p>
  <p> The doctor is trying to work with a patient with a<br>
    broken arm. Frustrated, he calls for Pulaski:</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    Doctor Pulaski.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    I've got a problem here.</p>
  <p> Pulaski storms past the chastised nurse to where the<br>
    harried doctor is staring at the broken arm and a shell<br>
    that isn't doing its job.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The knitter isn't working.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Use a splint.</p>
  <p> A beat as the doctor stares uncomprehendingly at<br>
    Pulaski.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Splint. It's a very ancient<br>
    concept -- two flat pieces of wood<br>
    or plastic, a bandage. The broken<br>
    limb is kept immobile.</p>

    That's crazy, that's not<br>
    practicing medicine.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Oh yes it is. A time-honored way<br>
    of practicing medicine -- by<br>
    using your head and your heart<br>
    and your hands. So jump to it.</p>
  <p> The doctor jumps to it.</p>

  <p> His fingers fly across the key pads. Suddenly the<br>
    console passes a powerful electric shock into Geordi,<br>

    Suppose this thing manages to<br>
    rewrite our entire system? It's<br>
    so far beyond us that we don't<br>
    have a hope of understanding it,<br>
    much less controlling it. Our<br>
    ignorance could kill us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We may never reach that point.<br>
    A variation of what happened to<br>
    the Yamato may destroy us first.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So we just sit here while the ship<br>
    disintegrates around us?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The probe was launched from<br>
    Iconia, probably by an automated<br>
    system. There may be records<br>
    near the launch site which<br>
    could help us find a solution.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll form an away team.</p>

    We've had this discussion a<br>
    hundred times before.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Romulan vessel, this is Commander<br>
    William Riker, first officer of<br>
    the USS Enterprise. Why did you<br>
    attempt to fire on us?</p>
  <p> TARIS<br>
    This is Sub-Commander Taris of<br>
    the Haakona. Why have you<br>
    penetrated deeper into the<br>
    Neutral Zone?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why are you still here?</p>
  <p> TARIS<br>
    I have claimed this planet for<br>
    the Romulan Empire.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is the Neutral Zone. Nobody<br>
    can claim anything.</p>
  <p> TARIS<br>
    You will withdraw or I will be<br>
    forced to destroy your ship and<br>
    your away team.</p>
  <p> She is interrupted mid-speech. There is break-up on<br>
    Taris's face. CUT TO a view of the Romulan ship as it<br>
    cloaks and uncloaks, cloaks and uncloaks. As it<br>
    cloaks, communication is lost. Then returns when the<br>
    ship reappears. Taris is looking rattled as she<br>
    appears and disappears.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What the hell?</p>
  <p> Taris is back on viewscreen. She is once again fully<br>

    until we solve our more immediate<br>
    problem?</p>
  <p> TARIS<br>
    You're stalling for time.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Sir, another probe launched from<br>
    the planet, heading for the<br>
    Romulan.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Williams)<br>
    Have we got our phasers back?</p>
  <p> WILLIAMS<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Taris, if you've got phaser<br>
    capability, you better use it now!</p>
  <p> TARIS<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Destroy that probe!</p>
  <p> Taris blips out, and we have a view of the cruiser with<br>
    the incoming probe. The probe reaches eye level and is<br>
    destroyed by phaser fire. Taris does not return.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And not even a thank you.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Sub-Commander Taris is deeply<br>
    frustrated, probably because her<br>
    ship is as crippled as the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Why would the Romulans be having<br>
    problems? They haven't been<br>

  <p> WILLIAMS<br>
    Commander, sensors indicate the<br>
    Romulans are attempting to<br>
    transport a team.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    They lost them, complete<br>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>34 INT. ICONIAN CONTROL ROOM</p>
  <p> The away team is exploring. They have beamed into a<br>
    dimly lit room. The walls are covered with controls<br>
    and conduits. Directly across from them is a wall<br>
    which contains three silver gateways. In the center of<br>
    the room is a pentagon-shaped &quot;table&quot; about waist high.<br>
    At the center of the table is a large, softly glowing,<br>
    translucent blue dome. It is flecked with the same<br>
    bits of reflective material as the probe. Around the<br>
    dome, extending to the edge of the table, are countless<br>
    colored keys. There are also flat screens set in each<br>
    of the five angles of the table. Each screen is a<br>
    different geometric shape -- a square, a triangle, an<br>
    octagon, a pentagon and a rectangle. There is alien<br>
    script beneath the screens and on certain parts of the<br>
    control walls. Data is scanning with his tricorder.<br>
    Worf has his phaser out. Picard just roams the room.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (touching his insignia)<br>
    Enterprise. Come in Enterprise.<br>
    Still no response, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Keep trying them. Communication<br>
    is going to be erratic.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I do not want to become a<br>
    permanent resident of this<br>
    planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nor do I, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Scans indicate no other life-forms<br>
    on the planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I would not expect any. Judging<br>
    from the severity of bombardment,<br>
    I doubt any Iconians survived.</p>
  <p> Picard claps his hands and briskly rubs them together<br>

    Well, Mister Data, let us see if we<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard studies the alien writing as Data joins him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is very reminiscent of<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. There are also<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's risky with Taris sitting<br>

    impossible to pull off, but it<br>
    will give everyone something<br>
    to do. You go and start<br>

  <p> Picard and Worf are studying the console. Data comes<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, your original hypothesis<br>
    was correct. Iconian is the<br>
    parent tongue for a language<br>
    family consisting of Dewan,<br>
    Iccobar and Dinasian. I have<br>
    constructed a basic working<br>
    understanding through a comparison<br>
    of common root words such as<br>
    mother, father, food, death,<br>
    child, home, tribe, pain, love,<br>
    mine, yours, ours --</p>

    Data, Data, Data -- the point.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You do understand that my<br>
    interpretation of the symbols will<br>
    not be exact?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, let's get on with it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (pointing to a set of<br>

    This would appear to be the manual<br>
    override.</p>
  <p> He touches the keys, and a LOW HUMMING fills the room.<br>
    The light within the globe intensifies. Worf stiffens<br>
    with hand on phaser. Suddenly rays lance out from the<br>
    globe. Our people react. The rays strike the panels<br>
    on the back wall and intersect in the room to form the<br>
    gateway. It spins slowly. Each time it comes around,<br>
    a new image appears through the opening. It makes one<br>
    full revolution every couple of minutes. Appearing is<br>
    a courtyard of a house with an alien-colored sky, a<br>
    desert scene with a city in the distance, a street with<br>
    iron balconies and pastel stucco walls, a grassy field<br>
    (and eventually the Enterprise and the Romulan<br>
    bridges). Picard walks forward and stares in wonder.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That was not manual override.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    Demons of Air and Darkness,<br>

    gate. From his elbow down, the arm is gone. Picard<br>
    reacts quickly to this foolishness. Leaping forward,<br>
    he grabs Data by the shoulders and pulls him back just<br>
    as the scene changes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, that was very foolish.</p>

  <p>36 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But we have established it is<br>
    not a holograph. If I step<br>

    gateway.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, Data. You might not be able<br>
    to get back, and I can't risk<br>
    losing you.</p>

    a room? Those worlds might be<br>
    in distant sectors of our galaxy.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a turn about the room, studying the<br>
    gateway.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing; almost to<br>
    himself)<br>
    This is what Varley feared. What<br>
    he lost his life for.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Romulans could turn this<br>
    technology into a weapon.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Like the Iconians did.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, I believe that to be<br>
    incorrect. Captain, there is<br>
    nothing in this room to indicate<br>
    it was used as a military command<br>
    center. It is much more akin to<br>
    a transporter room.</p>

  <p>36 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But the probe was hostile.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We can't make that assumption.<br>
    The probe's effect on the Yamato<br>
    was devastating, but I suspect<br>
    that was by accident rather than<br>
    design.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We do know that the Iconians were<br>
    conquerors.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do we? The little we know was<br>
    passed down by the descendants<br>
    of the people who attacked this<br>
    world. I'm beginning to think<br>
    the Iconians may have been the<br>
    victims of some very bad press.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's an unfortunate tendency<br>
    in most cultures to fear what they<br>
    don't understand. It is possible<br>
    that their enemies, when confronted<br>
    with this technology, were driven<br>
    to attack the Iconians out of<br>
    fear.</p>
  <p> Worf turns back to the gate to contemplate Picard's<br>
    words. Picard and Data return to the console.<br>
    Occasionally Data runs scans with his tricorder.<br>
    Suddenly the bridge of the Enterprise appears.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Contagion&quot; - REV. 01/11/89 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> The other two whirl at the note of urgency in his voice<br>
    and have a brief glimpse of the Enterprise before it is<br>
    replaced by an alien landscape. The Romulan bridge<br>
    appears, vanishes; and we again have an alien<br>
    landscape.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Was that really the Enterprise?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I believe that it was. Gentlemen,<br>
    we have a way home.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    I think the Iconians might have<br>
    outfoxed their enemies. Perhaps<br>
    they didn't all die in the<br>
    bombardment; some may have passed<br>
    through this.</p>
  <p> Data runs more scans with his tricorder.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, there is a vast underground<br>
    power source which is controlled<br>
    by this console.</p>
  <p> He points to a bank of lights which had not been lit<br>
    previously, but are now glowing brightly.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    My triggering of the gateway has<br>
    caused a dramatic upsurge in power<br>
    levels.<br>
    (runs more scans)<br>
    Ah, I have access.</p>
  <p> Symbols appear on one side of the screens. Data<br>
    studies them. He begins to input using the keys on<br>
    the console.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, the Enterprise again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Time the rotation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Contagion&quot; - REV. 01/09/89 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED: (6)</p>
  <p> Suddenly the globe emits a HIGH-PITCHED TONE followed<br>
    by a beam of sickly green light. There is a SOUND OF<br>
    CRACKLING as the ray envelops Data. It travels the<br>
    length of his body, rendering him immobile. The energy<br>
    flow stops, and Data -- stiff as a board -- starts to<br>
    topple. He is caught by Worf who eases him to the<br>
    floor. Data lies unmoving, eyes open but devoid of<br>
    expression, staring at the ceiling.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p>37 INT. ICONIAN CONTROL ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, seated on the floor, cradles Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, respond.</p>
  <p> Data shudders, a shiver running from his head to his<br>
    feet. Blinks.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Are you all right?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, I am damaged.</p>
  <p> Worf and Picard have gotten Data to his feet, but he<br>
    is swaying drunkenly and can barely stand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How bad is it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Iconian program is attempting<br>
    a rewrite of my basic software.<br>
    Physical manifestations --</p>
  <p> Data abruptly cuts off and seems to go into analysis<br>
    mode.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, without him we have no hope<br>
    of deciphering the program.</p>
  <p> We see Picard's terrible agony as he realizes that the<br>
    Enterprise may be doomed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long until the Enterprise<br>
    reappears?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Six minutes if the cycle holds.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Contagion&quot; - REV. 01/09/89 - ACT FIVE 44.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stand ready, Mister Worf, and go<br>
    through with Data. Geordi can<br>
    learn from him. Maybe help him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, we have not yet established<br>
    that that...<br>
    (a gesture to the gate)<br>
    ... is truly a gateway.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This will be the test.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (holding out a hand)<br>
    Data, give me your tricorder.</p>
  <p> With a hand that shakes like a palsy victim, Data<br>
    removes the tricorder. He then hesitates, moving his<br>
    head like a questing stork.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, what is your present<br>
    location?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm right in front of you... Data,<br>
    what is it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Please, take the tricorder. I<br>
    am unable to sufficiently pinpoint<br>
    your location to be able to hand<br>
    it to you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're blind.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard takes the tricorder from Data's hand. He has<br>
    to peel back the android's fingers because Data has<br>
    such a grip on the device. Data's equilibrium is shot,<br>
    and he walks in a tight circle around himself. He then<br>
    collapses again.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Contagion&quot; - REV. 01/11/89 - ACT FIVE 45.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (handing the tricorder<br>
    to Worf)<br>
    Destroy this.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But, sir, it contains the record<br>
    of all that we have discovered<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And that is precisely why it must<br>
    be destroyed. Time?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Three minutes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    I am running out of time. We<br>
    all are.</p>
  <p> Picard kneels beside Data and pulls him up until the<br>
    android is supported against his shoulder. Worf lays<br>
    the tricorder on the floor of the chamber and fires his<br>
    phaser at it. The tricorder VANISHES.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This room and the technology<br>
    contained in it must be destroyed.<br>
    It cannot be allowed to fall into<br>
    Romulan hands.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I understand...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How! How do I do it? How can<br>
    I destroy everything? Control<br>
    room, the probes? All of it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The... power... source.</p>

    How? What do I do?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The... probes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Probes... the probes. Launch?<br>
    Do I launch the probes?</p>
  <p> Data nods.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing; to Worf)<br>
    What's that going to do? Nothing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doors.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doors?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Perhaps the probes are in a<br>
    launch bay.</p>
  <p> Data nods energetically.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The doors will open automatically<br>
    when the launch begins. I'd have<br>
    to override.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The power source! The backwash<br>
    from the rockets will spill into<br>
    the main power grids and cause<br>
    an overload.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Which control keys? Damn, I<br>
    forgot you can't see.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Help.</p>
  <p> Picard rightly assumes that Data wants to be helped<br>
    to the console. With Worf's help they get the Android<br>
    to his feet and over to the console. This dialogue<br>
    has to fly.</p>

    Blue, blue, blue.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hope you're not stuttering.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    I don't know how long a delay<br>
    there will be between the launch<br>
    and the detonation. I'll hold<br>
    off keying the launch sequence<br>
    until you're through the gate.<br>
    How long until the Enterprise<br>
    returns?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Almost time, sir. Captain, you<br>
    will be killed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll go through the gate.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But where will you end up?</p>

  <p>37 CONTINUED: (6)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any place is going to be better<br>
    than this room. Worf, I'm<br>
    depending on you. Get Data back<br>
    to the Enterprise. He may be<br>
    their last hope.</p>
  <p> Worf helps Data. At the time expected, the bridge of<br>
    the Enterprise appears and the Klingon steps through.</p>

  <p>38 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Access panels are open. The bridge is a complete<br>
    mess. Still mood lighting. People work at the various<br>
    stations. Riker is overseeing this last-ditch effort.<br>
    Worf and Data APPEAR.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf! What happened? Where's<br>
    the captain?</p>
  <p> Data makes small mewling little sounds, then falls<br>
    silent.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We must take Data to Engineering.</p>
  <p> Worf shifts Data into a fireman's carry, and he and<br>
    Riker start moving.</p>
  <p>39 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> CLOSE UP on Geordi's hands as he runs scans on Data.<br>
    PULL BACK to reveal Riker watching tensely. The<br>
    scanner is emitting a steady beeping sound.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't know how to help him.<br>
    But comparing recorded norms for<br>
    Data to the current readings, it's<br>
    clear that all his functions are<br>
    going crazy. If we had an expert<br>
    -- Maddox, or somebody --</p>
  <p> The steady blip of the scanner suddenly becomes a flat,<br>
    steady tone; and the line goes flat.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    He's gone.</p>
  <p>40 INT. ICONIAN CONTROL ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard keys in the launch sequence. A LOW HEAVY<br>

    This is the Enterprise. How did<br>
    I get here?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He cleared the Iconian program<br>

  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Let me think for a second. There<br>
    was an incompatible program<br>
    running through Data's system, so<br>
    the mechanism started searching<br>
    for a way to keep him alive. The<br>
    solution must have been a shutdown<br>
    and a total wipe of all affected<br>
    memory.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Query. What have I forgotten?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    One question. Can we do the same<br>

    I don't see why not... but it will<br>
    have to be a complete shutdown.<br>
    We turn her off, effect a wipe<br>
    of the Yamato log and every<br>
    subsequent event since we<br>
    downloaded it. I'll then reload<br>
    all the ship's programs from the<br>
    protected archives in the main<br>
    core.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Geordi, a shutdown means that the<br>
    shields are going to be coming<br>
    down too, and we're hanging nose<br>
    to nose with a Romulan battle<br>
    cruiser.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hey, Commander, whether it's<br>
    Romulan phasers or our own<br>
    warp engines we're just as dead.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> Geordi whirls to obey. Data is very confused, but he's<br>

    showing the bridge of the Enterprise. Picard runs for<br>
    it, but at the last minute it switches to the bridge of<br>

    Blast radius is nine hundred<br>
    kilometers.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker begin walking toward the doors. Data<br>
    continues to burble on over their dialogue:</p>
  <p> DATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The dust particles entering the<br>
    stratosphere will take an<br>
    estimated seven months to fall<br>
    back to the surface. The<br>
    diminution in sunlight will have<br>
    the effect of lowering average<br>
    daily surface temperatures on<br>
    Iconia by fifteen degrees<br>
    Celsius.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see Data's back to normal.</p>

    With a little touch of amnesia.</p>

  <p> Picard pauses and surveys the lights, glances about the<br>
    Transporter Room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It seems that everything is back<br>
    to normal. Well done, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (with a grin)<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Contagion&quot; - 01/04/89 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> The two officers exit as we:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
