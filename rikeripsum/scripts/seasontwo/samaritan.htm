    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Cruises at warp speed as we hear:</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 42723.8.<br>
    The Enterprise is en route to the<br>
    Epsilon Nine Sector for<br>
    astronomical survey of a new<br>
    pulsar cluster. In the meantime,<br>
    Ensign Crusher will be diverting<br>
    to Starbase five one five for<br>
    progressive Starfleet exams...</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - THE TURBOLIFT DOORS</p>
  <p> open and WESLEY enters the bridge, where RIKER, DATA,<br>
    and WORF are at their usual stations, supernumeraries<br>
    filling in as needed. Wesley steps up to Riker, who<br>
    hands him a Starfleet communications rectangle.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This just came in from Starfleet--</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (taking the disk)<br>
    The testing parameters?</p>
  <p> Data steps up to them:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Do not be apprehensive. I found<br>
    the Academy examinations quite<br>
    elementary.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You would.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Your earlier test results were<br>
    good enough to get you Academy<br>
    credit for your work here. I<br>
    don't think you have anything to<br>
    worry about.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But those Academy cadets are<br>
    pretty competitive, you know.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They don't have your practical<br>
    experience, Wes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander Riker is correct. While<br>
    the information imparted to cadets<br>
    at the Academy is unquestionably<br>
    vital for prospective Starfleet<br>
    officers, it nevertheless requires<br>
    a significant period of<br>
    supplementary systems training<br>
    and situational disciplines.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data... isn't that what I just<br>
    said?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Commander. But not quite<br>
    as perspicuously.</p>
  <p> Riker and Wesley react to that as we GO TO:</p>
  <p>3 INT. SICKBAY/PULASKI'S OFFICE - PICARD</p>
  <p> paces in front of PULASKI, obviously being evasive:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I won't have you telling me what<br>
    course to set!</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    As chief medical officer, I am<br>
    ordering you to report to Starbase<br>
    five one five immediately!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh, please. I feel fine.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    The truth is, you've neglected<br>
    this far too long.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This ship has a mission to carry<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    An astronomical survey to be<br>
    conducted by the science officers,<br>
    I believe.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've been looking forward to<br>
    seeing the Epsilon Pulsar Cluster<br>
    for myself.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Then we'll perform the procedure<br>
    right here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Absolutely not.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    My staff and I are perfectly<br>
    capable of giving you the<br>
    replacement.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's not the point. Not only<br>
    am I in splendid health, but it<br>
    would be inappropriate for you<br>
    to perform the procedure.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Why Captain Picard, I had no idea.<br>
    You do have an ego, don't you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Clarify.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    You're concerned about your image.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I never said that.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Don't worry. Get yourself down<br>
    to Starbase five one five and your<br>
    image will be safe with me.</p>
  <p> He reacts to that, exiting as we GO TO:</p>
  <p>4 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - THE TURBOLIFT DOORS</p>
  <p> open and Picard steps out, nearly bumping into Wesley<br>
    who was about to enter the turbolift:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Captain... excuse me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand you're heading for<br>
    Starbase five one five.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir. I was just on my way<br>
    to Shuttle Bay Two.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good. I have some business of<br>
    my own there. I shall accompany.<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> Wesley reacts, eyes widening, his voice cracking:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You will?<br>
    (then, composing<br>
    himself)<br>
    I mean, yessir!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Prepare the shuttle for immediate<br>
    departure.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Wesley exits via the turbolift; Riker reacts to all of<br>
    this, steps up to Picard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is there something I can take care<br>
    of for you at Starbase<br>
    five one five?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm afraid not, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But you'll miss the Epsilon Pulsar<br>
    survey.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm very well aware of that. You<br>
    have the bridge. Carry on.</p>
  <p> With that, Picard turns and exits into the Ready Room.<br>
    Riker considers all of this, shares a concerned glance<br>
    with the other bridge officers and then follows Picard<br>
    into the Ready Room as we GO TO:</p>
  <p>4A INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - PICARD</p>
  <p> turns to face Riker, as the door slides shut behind<br>
    them:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it, Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is something wrong? This trip<br>
    to Starbase five one five seems<br>
    rather unexpected.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles awkwardly, goes about the business of<br>
    picking up some reading material for his journey:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not to worry. Ensign Crusher and<br>
    I will rendezvous with you on your<br>
    return from the Epsilon Pulsar<br>
    Cluster.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Forgive my saying so, sir, but<br>
    you're being rather enigmatic.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Consider it captain's privilege.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    As first officer, I have complete<br>
    security clearance--</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>4A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This has nothing to do with ship's<br>
    business.<br>
    (then, with a sigh)<br>
    Suffice it to say that this is<br>
    strictly a matter of ...vanity.</p>
  <p> Picard heads for the door with his books and exits as<br>
    we GO TO:</p>
  <p>5 INT. CORRIDOR - GEORDI</p>
  <p> is on his way to Engineering with SONYA, walking with<br>
    Wesley, who is obviously worried about something:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Starbase five one five's not<br>
    exactly around the corner, Wes.<br>
    You have quite a trip ahead of<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yeah. I know.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Relax. You'll do fine on your<br>
    exams.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's not the exams I'm worried<br>
    about. It's Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    Why? He's not taking the exams.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    He's coming with me to starbase.<br>
    Just the two of us. Nearly a<br>
    six-hour transit. What am I going<br>
    to talk to him about for six<br>
    hours?</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    Archaeology...semantics...<br>
    literature... art... you can learn<br>
    a lot from Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> Just then, Picard approaches:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Nice day for a little trip,<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hardly.</p>
  <p> Picard and Wesley head off down another corridor as<br>
    Geordi and Sonya react to Picard's mood as we GO TO:</p>
  <p>5A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> comes out of warp, decelerating to impulse speed while</p>
  <p>6 OMITTED</p>
  <p>7 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - DATA</p>
  <p> is in his &quot;Ops&quot; chair as he hears:</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Shuttle Number Two ready for<br>
    departure.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We are at impulse speed and you<br>
    are cleared for departure.</p>
  <p>8 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> the shuttle exits the Shuttle Bay.</p>
  <p>9 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL) - RIKER</p>
  <p> enters from the Ready Room, looking up at the<br>
    viewscreen now to see the shuttle streaking away. He<br>
    crosses to Data:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data... wasn't the captain looking<br>
    forward to this mission to the<br>
    Epsilon Pulsar Cluster?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    So he had said.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - TEASER 8.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then what would make him change<br>
    his mind? Why would he leave the<br>
    ship now?</p>
  <p> Data reacts to that, exchanging a concerned glance with<br>
    Riker. Suddenly, Worf pipes up with:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Receiving a Mayday on all<br>
    frequencies, sir!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Source?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Rhomboid Dronegar Sector<br>
    zero-zero-six--</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Detail.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Ship...unidentified...distress.<br>
    Nothing more.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar<br>
    zero-zero-six at warp seven.</p>
  <p> Data looks to Riker, quietly concerned:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir... Rhomboid Dronegar sector<br>
    will put us at considerable<br>
    distance from Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I know, Data. I know.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>9A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> flashes past at warp seven while</p>
  <p>10 INT. THE BRIDGE - RIKER</p>
  <p> is in his chair while Data and Worf man their stations<br>
    as:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Entering Rhomboid Dronegar Sector<br>
    zero-zero-six.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have a ship on target path.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Slow to impulse speed.</p>
  <p>10A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> decelerates</p>
  <p>10B INT. THE BRIDGE - RIKER</p>
  <p> rises now:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Viewer.</p>
  <p> Data taps his console appropriately and</p>
  <p>11 THE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> comes alive with the image of an unusual alien ship.<br>
    Hardly aerodynamic, this craft appears to be something<br>
    of a throwback when contrasted to the Enterprise. It's<br>
    dead in the water. Riker approaches the screen,<br>
    curious while Worf remains cautious:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Deploy shields, sir?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hold fast.<br>
    (then)<br>
    Data?</p>

    (re: the ship)<br>
    Basic early design capable of<br>
    sub-light travel only.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Commander, we are being hailed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p> The VIEWSCREEN image glitches for a split-second and<br>
    then comes alive with the interior of the Pakled ship.<br>
    It looks like an analog throwback to the late twenty-first<br>
    century. A number of slothful, droopy-eyed humanoids<br>
    appear to be working with great confusion on some<br>
    engineering control panels in the b.g., as their<br>
    commander, GREBNEDLOG, steps into foreground.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I am First Officer William Riker.<br>
    This is the USS Enterprise,<br>
    responding to your distress<br>
    signal--</p>
  <p> Grebnedlog arches his massive brow, his eyes opening<br>
    just a bit wider as he responds with typically wistful<br>
    Pakled hypoplastic speech, almost a sense of hopeful<br>
    longing in their every word:</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Uh-hunh.</p>
  <p> Riker exchanges a curious glance with Data, then back<br>
    to screen:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What is your problem?</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    We are far from home.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So are we, but you sent out a<br>
    Mayday--</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Uh-hunh</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you need help?</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    We are Pakleds. Our ship is the<br>
    Mondor.<br>
    (re the work in the<br>
    b.g.)<br>
    It is broken.</p>
  <p> Riker sighs impatiently, turns to Data:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sensors indicate engineering<br>
    problems.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lieutentant La Forge to bridge...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    They have experienced total<br>
    guidance system failure and they<br>
    have less than twenty-four hours' reserve<br>
    power.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to viewscreen)<br>
    What brings you so far from home?</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    (wistfully)<br>
    We look for things.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What were you looking for?</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Things we need.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Can you be more specific?</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Uh-hunh.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then please do so.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Things that make us go. We need<br>
    help.</p>
  <p> In the b.g., the turbolift doors open and Geordi steps<br>
    onto the bridge, spots the viewscreen. He looks at the<br>
    Pakleds, grins wryly:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Let me guess: their rubber band<br>
    broke, right?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to viewscreen)<br>
    What is the nature of your<br>
    mission?</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    (nodding slowly)<br>
    We look for things.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (aside; to Data)<br>
    Do you hear an echo?<br>
    (then, back to<br>
    viewscreen)<br>
    Understood. Our chief engineer<br>
    will beam aboard to help you--<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Out.</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts to that as all eyes turn toward him:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Wait a minute... me?</p>
  <p> And as Riker pats him reassuringly on the back, Worf<br>
    turns from his station, concern etched all over his<br>
    Klingon countenance:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (re: the viewscreen)<br>
    Do we truly need to send our chief<br>
    engineer over to them?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They obviously need our help.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Why do we not simply give them<br>
    the information they need to make<br>
    their repairs?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you honestly think they could<br>
    handle our technical<br>
    specifications?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We don't know that much about<br>
    them. I urge caution.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Acknowledged, Worf... but we have<br>
    an obligation to render aid.<br>
    (turns to Geordi).<br>
    Report to the Transporter Room<br>
    with all necessary gear.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> With that, Geordi exits. Worf remains concerned, leans<br>
    in to Riker with:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We need more information.</p>
  <p> Riker turns to Data:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you have anything else on them?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    They are a relatively benign<br>
    species.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Don't they seem a little... slow?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    They may merely have<br>
    poorly-developed language skills.</p>
  <p> Worf leans in with:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What about weapons?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Our scan shows very limited<br>
    armaments.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think we can relax, Worf. They<br>
    can't even get their ship moving<br>
    without our help, and we certainly<br>
    have them outmanned and outgunned.</p>
  <p> Worf can't argue with that as we GO TO:</p>
  <p>12 EXT. SPACE - PICARD'S SHUTTLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> hurtling past us at impulse speed while:</p>
  <p>13 INT. THE SHUTTLE - WESLEY</p>
  <p> handles the controls with confidence and aplomb.<br>
    Picard checks the instruments with a scowl:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    E.t.a. thirteen-thirty hours.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Not exactly warp speed, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    More like a late twenty-second century<br>
    interplanetary journey.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You should read more history,<br>
    Ensign.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (mumbling to himself)<br>
    Complete waste of time...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Pardon, sir?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I shouldn't be taking this trip<br>
    at all. I belong back on the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Why are you going with me to<br>
    Starbase five one five, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (snappish)<br>
    It's certainly not my idea!</p>
  <p> Wesley reacts, afraid to probe further. Picard glances<br>
    over at:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm sorry. I don't mean to take<br>
    it out on you.<br>
    (then)<br>
    I just hate going through another<br>
    damned cardiac replacement.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Cardiac replacement? I didn't<br>
    know...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Now you do.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    A parthenogenetic implant?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What else would it be?<br>
    (then, a bit softer)<br>
    My own heart was injured and a<br>
    replacement was necessary. That<br>
    would have been it except that<br>
    the replacement is flawed and must<br>
    now be put right.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Why would anyone use a flawed<br>
    replacement?</p>
  <p> Picard ices over at that, glaring out at the stars<br>
    ahead now:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Just pilot the shuttle, Ensign.</p>
  <p> And on Picard's obdurate countenance, we GO TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>14 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it maintains its position near the Mondor while</p>
  <p>15 INT. THE BRIDGE - RIKER</p>
  <p> turns his attention to the viewscreen where the Pakleds<br>
    continue with their inefectual attempts at repair.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All right. Let's get these<br>
    repairs made so we can all be on<br>
    our way.<br>
    (then)<br>
    First officer to La Forge...</p>
  <p>16 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL) - GEORDI</p>
  <p> is on the transporter platform, &quot;tool kit&quot; in hand:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, Commander. Ready for<br>
    transport.</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    Proceed.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Energize...</p>
  <p> And as Geordi DEMATERIALIZES, we GO TO:</p>
  <p>17 INT. THE PAKLED SHIP &quot;MONDOR&quot; (OPTICAL) - GEORDI</p>
  <p> MATERIALIZES, startling the Pakleds who react with<br>
    their own brand of anxiety:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hey, hey, it's okay. I'm here<br>
    to help. Take it easy.</p>
  <p> Grebnedlog approaches tentatively with what appears to<br>
    be profound, heartfelt sincerity:</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    We are far from home.</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts to that non-sequitur, eager to get down<br>
    to business:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT ONE 17.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What seems to be the problem?</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Our ship is the Mondor.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Right. I got that already.<br>
    (then, looking around)<br>
    Who's in charge of engineering?</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    My friend. His name is Reginod.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (looking around)<br>
    Think I could meet him?</p>
  <p> Another Pakled steps up. Grebnedlog makes the<br>
    &quot;introduction&quot;:</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    We have an engineer.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Great...</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    He is Reginod.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, I think you mentioned that.</p>
  <p> REGINOD<br>
    We look for things.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So I've heard.</p>
  <p> REGINOD<br>
    (re the ship)<br>
    It is broken.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well... maybe I can fix it.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Can you make our ship go?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I think so.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT ONE 18.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    We look for things to make us go.</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts, feeling like somebody's &quot;got their<br>
    needle stuck&quot;. He smiles patiently:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Fellas... why don't you show me<br>
    where your guidance system is?</p>
  <p> Geordi starts wandering toward the back of the ship.<br>
    Reginod turns to Grebnedlog, smiling:</p>
  <p> REGINOD<br>
    He is smart.</p>
  <p> Grebnedlog returns the salivary smile as we GO TO:</p>
  <p>18 INT. ENTERPRISE'S MAIN BRIDGE-TURBOLIFT DOORS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> open and Troi enters the scene, immediately riveted<br>
    by what she sees up on the viewscreen. She steps over<br>
    to Riker and Data, who regard the scene with Geordi<br>
    with bemusement:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Commander... Lieutenant La Forge<br>
    is on an alien ship?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes. We're rendering assistance<br>
    to some curious throwbacks.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    How they ever mastered the<br>
    rudiments of space travel is a<br>
    genuine curiosity.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Commander... Those aliens... what<br>
    they feel is not helplessness<br>
    ... Lieutenant La Forge is in great<br>
    danger!</p>
  <p> Riker and Data react to that new input as</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT ONE 19.</p>
  <p>18A GEORDI</p>
  <p> goes about his work, unaware of any hazard as we</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END ACT ONE </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>19 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> remains in position, in some proximity to the Mondor.</p>
  <p>20 INT. THE MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL) - TROI</p>
  <p> remains transfixed, Riker, Data and Worf reacting as<br>
    she stands there, staring at the viewscreen:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Danger... great danger...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Can you be more specific,<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    They are insincere... It is not<br>
    our help they want.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Help is all they're going to get.<br>
    They certainly can't force<br>
    anything upon us, can they?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You feel they are weak.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: the viewscreen)<br>
    Look at them. Not exactly Jarada<br>
    or Romulans.</p>
  <p> Data looks over at Riker, shares her concerns now:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Our Betazoid counselor is often<br>
    aware of things beyond our<br>
    perceptive abilities.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts to this, exchanges a glance of concern<br>
    with Worf as we GO TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>21 EXT. SPACE - PICARD'S SHUTTLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> continues on its journey while</p>
  <p>22 INT. THE SHUTTLE - PICARD</p>
  <p> appears to be reading, ignoring Wesley. Then, putting<br>
    his reading down for a moment:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Van Doren's technique has been<br>
    perfected to two point four<br>
    percent.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The cardiac replacement procedure.<br>
    It has a very low mortality rate.<br>
    Two point four percent.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Those are pretty good odds.</p>
  <p> He considers that for a beat, then admits:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The fact is, I'm not interested<br>
    in having my innards become the<br>
    subject of Starfleet gossip.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Of course, sir. But why didn't<br>
    you have Doctor Pulaski perform<br>
    the operation? You could've<br>
    trusted her to keep it quiet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's just say I have personal<br>
    reasons and leave it at that,<br>
    shall we?</p>
  <p> Picard returns to his &quot;reading&quot;. Wesley reacts, his<br>
    curiosity stifled now as we GO TO:</p>
  <p>23 INT. THE MONDOR - GEORDI</p>
  <p> is hard at work on the Pakled guidance system, really<br>
    enjoying himself. Several Pakleds including Grebnedlog<br>
    and Reginod hover nearby, observing him as he explains:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The power needs to be rerouted<br>
    through this venturi chamber<br>
    before it can be channeled through<br>
    the engine coils.</p>
  <p> REGINOD<br>
    It is broken.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But not for long. See? We're<br>
    going to reconfigure these<br>
    separators here...</p>
  <p> Reginod looks to Grebnedlog, who nods in agreement:</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    It is broken.</p>
  <p> REGINOD<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    You are brilliant.</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts, flattered, but realistic:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Actually, any first year<br>
    engineering intern could do the<br>
    same thing--</p>
  <p> Just then, Geordi reacts to his communicator as he<br>
    hears:</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    Lieutenant La Forge, this is<br>
    Commander Riker...</p>
  <p> Geordi taps his communicator and responds:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, Commander. Go ahead.</p>
  <p>24 INT. THE ENTERPRISE MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker and Troi stand before the viewscreen, observing<br>
    Geordi aboard the Mondor:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you all right?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sure. Why do you ask?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Counselor Troi has expressed<br>
    misgivings about your absence from<br>
    The Enterprise.</p>
  <p> In the b.g., Grebnedlog and Reginod exchange an<br>
    uncharacteristically alert glance by way of response<br>
    to that while:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't think there's much to<br>
    worry about.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Understood. But as soon as the<br>
    repairs are completed, I want you<br>
    back here.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir, I should be done<br>
    momentarily.</p>
  <p> Riker looks to Troi who remains unshaken in her<br>
    convictions while:</p>
  <p>25 INT. THE MONDOR - GEORDI</p>
  <p> twists the last framiss on the final spigot, looks up<br>
    with a smile:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There. Guidance is up and<br>
    running.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the lights flicker, dim, and go dark. A<br>
    GROAN is heard as reserve power kicks in, lights come<br>
    up one-half and Geordi smiles:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Main power failure?</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Will our ship go now?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The guidance system's repaired,<br>
    but you're not going anywhere<br>
    without main power.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    (to Reginod)<br>
    It is broken.</p>
  <p> REGINOD<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Can you make it go?</p>
  <p> Geordi looks at the Pakleds, sighs heavily, then taps<br>
    his communicator:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Commander Riker, it looks like<br>
    this might take a little longer<br>
    than I anticipated...</p>
  <p> And as Geordi returns to this new problem...</p>
  <p>25A INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - RIKER AND TROI</p>
  <p> react to that with mutually mounting concern as we go<br>
    to...</p>
  <p>26 EXT. SPACE - PICARD'S SHUTTLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> continues its impulse-speed journey while</p>
  <p>27 INT. THE SHUTTLE - PICARD</p>
  <p> finally puts his reading down. Rubs his eyes. It's a<br>
    long trip. He seems lost in his thoughts, somewhat<br>
    unfocused as he studies the passing starfields. At his<br>
    side, Wesley checks his instruments carefully, takes<br>
    a deep breath as all seems well. Then, building his<br>
    courage for a beat, he turns to Picard:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You don't really care much for<br>
    people, do you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's okay. You can just do<br>
    without most people. I can<br>
    understand that --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT TWO 25.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign...Wesley. That's not true.<br>
    I have great regard for you, for<br>
    example. You're a fine young<br>
    man.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You don't have to say that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I do not say what I do not mean.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Well, it's pretty obvious how you<br>
    feel.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is it? How so?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Well, everyone knows. You don't<br>
    like kids.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I simply have... other priorities.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    That's too bad.<br>
    (then)<br>
    You might've made a pretty good<br>
    father.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Didn't you ever wish you had kids<br>
    of your own?</p>
  <p> A moment of silence as Picard considers that. Then:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wishing for a thing does not make<br>
    it so.</p>
  <p> Wesley ponders that reality as we GO TO:</p>
  <p>28 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> remains positioned near the Pakled ship Mondor while</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT TWO 26.</p>
  <p>29 INT. THE MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Worf, Data, Troi and Riker are all in position. Riker<br>
    is beginning to lose his patience as he turns to Data:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We send him over there for one<br>
    set of repairs and now they need<br>
    him for more.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Their ship is apparently quite<br>
    fragile.</p>
  <p> Riker steps forward to the viewscreen where he can see<br>
    the Pakleds working on their ship, Geordi in the<br>
    distant b.g., hard at work in a console panel:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is Riker on board the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> The Pakleds ignore Riker's summons, continue milling<br>
    around looking for the solution to their myriad<br>
    problems:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I repeat. This is Commander Riker<br>
    of the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Geordi looks up from his work briefly, calling to<br>
    Riker from the b.g.:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Almost got it, Commander--</p>
  <p> He returns to his work as Grebnedlog turns to face the<br>
    viewscreen now, his eyes almost completely<br>
    disinterested:</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    We look for things.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Apparently your ship is in need<br>
    of more than minor repairs.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Things to make it go.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We will use our tractor beam to<br>
    tow you to your nearest base.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT TWO 27.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    (re: Geordi)<br>
    He can make it go.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, but we need our chief<br>
    engineer back on board our ship--</p>
  <p> Just then, all power is restored to the Pakled ship,<br>
    and as lights come full-up, Geordi pulls himself out of<br>
    the console panel in the b.g. to hear:</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    He is smart.</p>
  <p> Geordi steps up beside Grebnedlog.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    All done, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Prepare to beam over.</p>
  <p>29A INT. MONDOR BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Reginod steps up behind Geordi with:</p>
  <p> REGINOD<br>
    You are good.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Thanks. We aim to please.</p>
  <p> REGINOD<br>
    We need you.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm flattered. Now I hate to<br>
    repair and run, but if you'll<br>
    excuse me...</p>
  <p> And Geordi steps away from the others, announcing to<br>
    Riker:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    One to beam aboard--</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT TWO 28.</p>
  <p>29A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Suddenly, Grebnedlog reaches over and with surprising<br>
    sleight-of-hand, deftly snatches Geordi's small phaser<br>
    away from him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hey!</p>
  <p> And as Geordi reaches to take the phaser back,<br>
    Grebnedlog fires with the stun setting, knocking Geordi<br>
    back, slamming him into a bulkhead, knocking his VISOR<br>
    off:</p>
  <p>29B RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> reacts immediately, calling out:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Transporter room, beam La Forge<br>
    over immediately.</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER CHIEF (V.O.)<br>
    Aye... negative response, sir!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Try again!</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER CHIEF (V.O.)<br>
    Negative response!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Pakled ship has a shield up,<br>
    sir!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A shield? What kind?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It appears to be beyond their<br>
    technology... similar to Romulan<br>
    shields!</p>
  <p> Riker clenches his jaw, commands the Pakleds now:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do not interfere with our<br>
    transporter beam. Repeat. Drop<br>
    your shield--</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the viewscreen glitches and goes to exterior<br>
    view of the Mondor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT TWO 29.</p>
  <p>29B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Viewer transmission terminated<br>
    and blocked.</p>
  <p> Riker shares a look of mounting concern with his crew<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p> ACT THREE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>30 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> remains in view of the Pakled's Mondor.</p>
  <p>31 INT. THE MAIN BRIDGE - RIKER, DATA, WORF, TROI</p>
  <p> are all in position as Riker commands his crew:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hail on all frequencies.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Running frequency search...<br>
    negative response.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They're ignoring us!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Apparently so, sir.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Phasers ready, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Shields up.</p>
  <p> Worf responds, activating his security station console,<br>
    reporting:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Shields up.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sensors at maximum sensitivity.</p>
  <p> Data responds with precision, then reports:</p>

    Phasers ready, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hold fire. Lieutenant La Forge<br>
    is on that ship.</p>
  <p> And as Riker and his crew contemplate that grim<br>
    reality, we GO TO:</p>
  <p>32 EXT. SPACE - PICARD'S SHUTTLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> continues cruising at impulse speed while</p>
  <p>33 INT. PICARD'S SHUTTLE - WESLEY</p>
  <p> carefully probes, eager to learn more about Picard:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Were you ever married?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My career always came first. I<br>
    never had time.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Don't you ever get lonely?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There have been certain costs<br>
    involved.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Well, I'll bet you've broken your<br>
    fair share of hearts along the<br>
    way...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A man needs to be careful about<br>
    that sort of thing.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Don't worry about me. Where women<br>
    are concerned, I'm in complete<br>
    control.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Really? I've always had to work<br>
    at it.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Have you always known what you've<br>
    wanted... been so disciplined?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No.<br>
    (re his chest)<br>
    That's why I'm going in to get<br>
    this thing replaced.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I don't understand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well... I was a young Starfleet<br>
    officer. Just a few years older<br>
    than you are now. Green as hell.<br>
    Top of my Academy Class, and oh,<br>
    so proud. Too proud, as it turned<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Several of us were on leave at<br>
    Far Space Starbase<br>
    Earhart... something of a galactic<br>
    outpost in those days--</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Before the Klingons joined the<br>
    Federation?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's right. My mates and I were<br>
    at the Bonestell Recreation<br>
    Facility, which was nothing more<br>
    than a crossroads at the time.<br>
    A trio of Nausicaans came in.<br>
    They were spoiling for a<br>
    confrontation with some<br>
    fresh-faced young Starfleet<br>
    officers like ourselves. Everyone<br>
    in our group had the good sense<br>
    to back away and give these<br>
    Nausicaans wide berth. Everyone<br>
    but me, that is. I stood<br>
    toe-to-toe with the nastiest of<br>
    the three and let him know what<br>
    I thought of him, his partners,<br>
    and his planet. I probably even<br>
    made some passing reference to<br>
    his questionable parentage.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    The next thing I knew, I had all<br>
    three of them on me and I was<br>
    fighting for my life. Acquitted<br>
    myself quite well for several<br>
    furious exchanges, I'm proud to<br>
    say.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You fought them? And won?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I had this one Nausicaan down on<br>
    the floor in a particularly<br>
    devious joint-lock when before<br>
    I knew what was happening, one<br>
    of his cohorts drew his weapon<br>
    and impaled me through the back.<br>
    Strange sensation, actually. Not<br>
    much pain. Shock, certainly, at<br>
    the sight of serrated metal coming<br>
    out of one's chest, and then a<br>
    certain giddy warmth. As I<br>
    recall, I actually laughed aloud.<br>
    It pierced my heart, of course,<br>
    and if we hadn't been so near a<br>
    medical facility I would surely<br>
    have died.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Really? Really? Then what?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then nothing. I was no hero.<br>
    I was an undisciplined,<br>
    opinionated, loud-mouthed young<br>
    man who was far out of his league.<br>
    It was a great and painful lesson,<br>
    but I learned it well. I only<br>
    hope you won't need to learn it<br>
    as I did...</p>
  <p> Wesley reacts with a gulp, realizing that he does<br>
    indeed have a lot to learn as we GO TO:</p>
  <p>34 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE AND THE MONDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> are as before while</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>35 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - RIKER</p>
  <p> paces, doing his best to keep his temper in check as he<br>
    looks to Data:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, come on...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am programming the comm system<br>
    to scan the interference patterns,<br>
    but a full analysis will take<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> Data reacts, his hands dexterously flying over his<br>
    console like nothing we've ever seen him do before as<br>
    we GO TO:</p>
  <p>36 INT. THE MONDOR - GEORDI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> is hit by yet another phaser stun, slams back into a<br>
    bulkhead and then struggles to his feet, shaking off<br>
    his phaser's stun effects:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Please... no more.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    This is fun.</p>
  <p> Geordi reaches out, groping for his VISOR:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    My VISOR...</p>
  <p> Reginod picks it up, studies it:</p>
  <p> REGINOD<br>
    This does something.</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts, realizes the Pakled has the VISOR now:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes. It allows me to see.</p>
  <p> Reginod and Grebnedlog react curiously. They wave<br>
    their digits in front of Geordi's face. He doesn't<br>
    react, reaching out for the VISOR as they keep it away<br>
    from him:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Where is it? Give it to me--</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Can you make us go now?</p>
  <p> Geordi lunges for him, stumbling. Reginod realizes:</p>
  <p> REGINOD<br>
    He cannot make us go.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    He is not smart.<br>
    (re: the VISOR)<br>
    This is smart.</p>
  <p> He hands the VISOR back to Geordi, and he clicks it<br>
    back into place, reacting now at the sight of his<br>
    phaser in Grebnedlog's mitt:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re: the phaser)<br>
    Be careful with that thing.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    You want to hurt us.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What? I came here to help you.<br>
    (re: the ship)<br>
    I fixed your guidance system and<br>
    the main power generator, didn't<br>
    I?</p>
  <p> REGINOD<br>
    (re: the phaser)<br>
    We can make more.</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts, realizing:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You have a replicator?</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    (with pride)<br>
    It is not broken.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I didn't come here to give you<br>
    weapons.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    (re: the phaser, points<br>
    it at Geordi)<br>
    You will make more.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts to that threat, considering his options<br>
    now as we GO TO:</p>
  <p>37 INT. THE ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE - WORF</p>
  <p> crosses to Riker with:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Commander, a photon torpedo may<br>
    penetrate their shield.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Any hostile move on our part<br>
    would only jeopardize Geordi.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But what do the Pakleds want?</p>
  <p> Riker glances over at Troi, hoping she has an answer:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    They have what they want... for<br>
    now.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts to that as we GO TO:</p>
  <p>38 INT. PICARD'S SHUTTLE - PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> thumbs through one of the books he's brought along.<br>
    Then, turning to Wesley:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Did you read that book I gave<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> Wesley reacts, barely concealing a grimace as he<br>
    recalls:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Some of it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's reassuring.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I just don't have much time.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT THREE 37.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (re the book in his<br>
    hand)<br>
    There is no greater challenge than<br>
    the study of philosophy.</p>
  <p> Wesley glances over at Picard's book:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    William James sure won't be on<br>
    my Starfleet exams.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The important things never will<br>
    be. Anyone can be trained to deal<br>
    with technology, and the<br>
    mechanics of piloting a starship.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But Starfleet Academy--</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It takes more than just that.<br>
    Open your mind to the past... to<br>
    history, art, philosophy. And<br>
    then...<br>
    (re: the stars)<br>
    ... this will mean something.</p>
  <p> Wesley considers this, almost embarrassed as he<br>
    realizes Picard does truly care about him. Then:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Just consider James' wisdom:<br>
    &quot;Philosophy... is not a technical<br>
    matter... it is our sense of what<br>
    life honestly means... our<br>
    individual way of feeling the<br>
    total push and pressure of the<br>
    cosmos.&quot;<br>
    (then)<br>
    That's what I want for you.</p>
  <p> Wesley reacts to that and as they move closer to<br>
    starbase, we GO TO:</p>
  <p>39 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> hasn't moved, still in sight of the Mondor while</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT THREE 38.</p>
  <p>40 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - TROI</p>
  <p> steps up to Riker as she reports her feelings:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It is all deception. Lies.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Everything? What about the<br>
    distress call?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Nothing the Pakleds have said or<br>
    done has been sincere.</p>
  <p> Data looks up from his console:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Intensified scan shows their<br>
    guidance system is perfectly<br>
    intact, as is their power<br>
    generator.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then what was Geordi repairing?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Apparently, the putative<br>
    malfunctions were carefully<br>
    programmed into their ship's<br>
    computer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I didn't think the Pakleds had<br>
    that kind of technology.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    They seem to have made some<br>
    technological leaps forward,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But why would they go through<br>
    the charade of needing our help?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    For the sole purpose of making<br>
    Lieutenant La Forge their prisoner.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Options?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT THREE 39.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Tactically speaking, we have<br>
    three choices: we can negotiate,<br>
    attack, or simply abandon<br>
    Lieutenant La Forge.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts to these uncomfortable options as we GO<br>
    TO:</p>
  <p>41 EXT./INT. STARBASE 515 MEDICAL COMPLEX</p>
  <p> Picard and Wesley approach the entrance to this<br>
    high-tech Starfleet facility:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You don't want to be late for your<br>
    exams, Ensign.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I've still got some time, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why do I get the feeling you're<br>
    acting like some kind of escort?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Doctor Pulaski asked me to make<br>
    sure you actually went inside.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That woman. She would.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I enjoyed our trip together.</p>
  <p> Picard's momentarily taken aback; the young man<br>
    actually cares about him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So did I.</p>
  <p> After a brief, moment of mutual feeling, Picard turns<br>
    and heads into the medical facility as we GO TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT THREE 40.</p>
  <p>41A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> hovers squarely in front of the Mondor.</p>
  <p>42 INT. THE ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker and the others react as Data monitors his panel:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    They are initiating visual<br>
    contact--</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe we'll find out what the hell<br>
    they really want.</p>
  <p> The viewscreen comes alive with the image of Grebnedlog<br>
    holding Geordi's phaser in his mitt. Reginod and the<br>
    other Pakleds all hold replicated versions of the<br>
    original now. Geordi is in the background, slowly<br>
    struggling to his feet once again, propped up by<br>
    Reginod as other Pakleds play recklessly with their<br>
    phasers. One of them takes a shot at his comrade,<br>
    missing him, like children playing with dangerous<br>
    toys. Grebnedlog turns to face the viewscreen:</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We demand the immediate return<br>
    of our crewmember.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Request denied.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lower your shield!</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Request denied.</p>
  <p> With that, he turns back toward Geordi, gives him a<br>
    quick stun blast from the phaser, and as Geordi is<br>
    slammed back into the bulkhead again, he collapses in a<br>
    heap.</p>
  <p>42A RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> reacts, truly beside himself with anger now:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT THREE 41.</p>
  <p>42A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Stop it! What do you want?</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    (re: the phaser)<br>
    Your ship has bigger ones.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    For defense against attack.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Your ship is strong. Smart.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Our strength contributes to peace<br>
    in this region of the galaxy.<br>
    We mean no one harm.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    You think we are not smart.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think you need to continue to<br>
    develop --</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    We are smart.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Prove it. Return our man to us.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    (re: Geordi)<br>
    You want him?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, dammit!</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Good. We want all computer<br>
    information from your ship.<br>
    (aims the phaser at<br>
    Geordi again)<br>
    Now.</p>
  <p> Riker and the others react to this frightening demand<br>
    as we</p>
  <p> FADE OUT:</p>
  <p> END OF ACT THREE </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p> ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>43 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> maintains its position within sight of the Mondor while</p>
  <p>44 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Riker, Data, Worf, Troi and Pulaski are gathered around<br>
    the table. All are grim, tense:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've got a man held hostage by<br>
    alien forces and all I have are<br>
    non-option options! I'd like some<br>
    input...</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Is Geordi all right?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (bristling)<br>
    They've already hit him with<br>
    multiple phaser stuns.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    He could need medical attention.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Security team stands ready to take<br>
    the initiative, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Our options have not changed.<br>
    We can either respond to the<br>
    Pakled demand or not. We can<br>
    either use force or not.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've already answered their<br>
    demand. Allowing access to the<br>
    Enterprise computers by alien<br>
    forces would be a complete breech<br>
    of Starfleet security.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>44 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Then force it must be.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts, considering that more seriously than ever<br>
    before now as we GO TO:</p>
  <p>45 INT. STARBASE 515 SURGICAL SUITE - (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard lies on an operating table, surrounded by<br>
    twenty-fourth century surgical equipment as NURSES prepare<br>
    him for his procedure. Off to one side, a MEDICAL TEAM<br>
    preps the replacement heart. The SURGEON steps up to<br>
    PICARD, reassures him:</p>
  <p> SURGEON<br>
    Ready?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Get on with it, Doctor. I've got<br>
    work to do.</p>
  <p> The surgeon nods to the ANESTHESIOLOGIST:</p>
  <p> SURGEON<br>
    Activate Sterile Field. Neural<br>
    calipers.</p>
  <p> The anesthesiologist places a silver wire caliper to<br>
    Picard's head. The caliper receives a signal from a<br>
    small console, which the anesthesiologist now attends<br>
    to. A beat later, Picard calmly closes his eyes in<br>
    perfect repose. The surgeon looks to his team:</p>
  <p> SURGEON<br>
    This will be a secondary cardiac<br>
    procedure with mid-line entry and<br>
    excision of the early model unit.<br>
    I anticipate no complications as<br>
    the patient has had positive<br>
    primary results and exhibits<br>
    extraordinary physical condition.<br>
    (then)<br>
    We'll all be home in time for<br>
    dinner.<br>
    (holds his hand out,<br>
    palm up)<br>
    Tissue mitigator.</p>
  <p> A nurse responds by slapping a small, glowing glass<br>
    rod in his hand as we GO TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>46 INT. THE ENTERPRISE OBSERVATION LOUNGE - RIKER</p>
  <p> and his crew are still between the proverbial rock and<br>
    a hard place as Data informs them:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is very little information<br>
    available on Pakled culture, but<br>
    the eclectic range of their<br>
    equipment would suggest that<br>
    everything they have has been<br>
    stolen from others.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And now they have become militant.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    So it would seem.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Rationale?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    They are unwilling to wait for<br>
    the timely evolution of their<br>
    species' intellectual capacity.<br>
    They seek instant knowledge,<br>
    instant power and gratification.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    You make them sound like petulant<br>
    children.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes. Infantile humans are known<br>
    for responses of a similar nature.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then suppose we treat them like<br>
    children.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's time we set some limits.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    To what effect, sir? We are faced<br>
    with an impossible conundrum.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not if we let Geordi give them<br>
    something they want... and then<br>
    create the right moment for him<br>
    to take it away.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Would you be suggesting a ruse<br>
    of some sort?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I would.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    And what if it fails? What'll<br>
    happen to Geordi then?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We don't have any choice. We have<br>
    to try.</p>
  <p>47 INT. STARBASE 515 SURGICAL SUITE - PICARD</p>
  <p> lies in repose, the surgical team calmly carrying out<br>
    the cardiac replacement procedure. Hovering over<br>
    Picard now is a large praying mantis-like piece of<br>
    equipment that seems to reach down into his chest<br>
    cavity:</p>
  <p> SURGEON<br>
    There has been some capillary<br>
    reaction here... let's proceed<br>
    carefully... we'll need sharper<br>
    focus on the thoracic<br>
    polychromatics and verification<br>
    of myocardial enzyme balance.</p>
  <p> The team attends to the equipment as the Surgeon<br>
    continues his delicate work and now we GO TO:</p>
  <p>48 INT. THE PAKLED MONDOR BRIDGE - GEORDI</p>
  <p> steels himself against the effects of the phaser shots<br>
    he's already endured, looks up at the Pakleds:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Let me talk to them. I'll get<br>
    you their computer banks.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>48 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    We want to be smart.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So open the hailing frequency.<br>
    They'll listen to me.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    (to Reginod)<br>
    We are smart.</p>
  <p> REGINOD<br>
    We need their computer things.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Yes.<br>
    (then, to Geordi)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Grebnedlog turns an analog dial on a console and now</p>
  <p>49 INT. THE ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> comes to life with the image of the Mondor bridge.<br>
    Riker steps up, flanked by Data, Worf, Pulaski, and<br>
    Troi, reacting to:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Commander Riker?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, Lieutenant. We're here.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The Pakleds seem pretty sincere.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    We want what we want.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Our computer banks are<br>
    non-negotiable.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Excuse me, Commander, but let's<br>
    consider that for a minute. The<br>
    Enterprise's protected memory<br>
    storage is so extensive that it<br>
    would take well over twenty-four<br>
    hours just to access.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI (Cont'd)<br>
    In that time, maybe we could all<br>
    reach a more acceptable resolution<br>
    to our little misunderstanding<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    We want to be smart.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Belive me, they're nothing if not<br>
    persistent.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    We want to be nothing if not<br>
    persistent.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Nobody ever said they were great<br>
    conversationalists.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where did they get their shields?</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Yes. We like shields.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    From what I've seen, half the<br>
    systems on this ship have been<br>
    stolen from Romulans, Jarada,<br>
    Klingons, just about anybody they<br>
    ever came in contact with.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    We like to be smart.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Confirmed, Lieutenant La Forge.<br>
    They steal technology.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But they lack the ability to use<br>
    it properly.</p>
  <p> Riker considers that, exchanges a conspiratorial<br>
    glance with his crew, then clears his throat and<br>
    intones:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FOUR 48.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (back to Geordi)<br>
    You're an excellent chief<br>
    engineer, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And of course, your knowledge<br>
    of phaser and photon weaponry is<br>
    unmatched.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    (chiming in mindlessly)<br>
    We like phasers.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's kind of you to say, sir,<br>
    but Lieutenant Worf --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (cutting him off)<br>
    Our missions are always inherently<br>
    dangerous. Any of us could be<br>
    called upon to make the ultimate<br>
    sacrifice at any time.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Uh... yes, sir, but --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Speaking of time, Lieutenant,<br>
    this may be your time. I shall<br>
    personally miss you.</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts to that with confusion. Grebnedlog and<br>
    Reginod glance at each other, concerned as Data steps<br>
    up to speak to Geordi:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You will always be in my memory.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data... wait a minute. Can't<br>
    we.. ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I shall miss you at weapons<br>
    systems analysis.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FOUR 49.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Geordi wrinkles his brow as he considers that for a<br>
    beat, then something begins to dawn upon him:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Weapons system analysis?<br>
    (then, tentative, trying<br>
    it out)<br>
    I guess you'll just have to carry<br>
    out the photon torpedo countdowns<br>
    without me.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Exactly. Fond farewell.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    (to Reginod)<br>
    He knows about weapons.</p>
  <p> REGINOD<br>
    He is smart.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    You can make us strong.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (with &quot;humility&quot;)<br>
    It's not something I like to talk<br>
    about --</p>
  <p> Just then, Worf steps up to face the viewscreen:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Lieutenant La Forge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Worf... my old friend.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Any classified weapons knowledge<br>
    you share with your captors will<br>
    be considered treason.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re the Pakleds)<br>
    I may have no choice.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You will die without honor.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I know. Just my luck.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FOUR 50.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You will never attain the<br>
    twenty-four levels of awareness.</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts to that, making specific mental notes:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Twenty-four? That's quite a<br>
    challenge.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Indeed. Twenty-four is the<br>
    gateway to heroic salvation.</p>
  <p> With that, Grebnedlog reaches over to the console,<br>
    twists the analog switch and cuts off further<br>
    communication and the viewscreen goes black. Pulaski<br>
    steps to Riker:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Do you think he understands?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He'd better.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He is afraid.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We all are, Counselor.</p>
  <p>50 INT. THE MONDOR BRIDGE - GREBNEDLOG</p>
  <p> now turns to Geordi with new appreciation:</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    You are smart.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not smart enough. I'm still here.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Make us strong.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I thought you wanted me to help<br>
    you... &quot;go&quot;. Why don't we work<br>
    on that guidance system, okay?</p>
  <p> Grebnedlog levels Geordi's phaser at him:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FOUR 51.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Make us strong. Or die.</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts to that, suppressing a mischievous smile<br>
    as he surrenders to their commands while we GO TO</p>
  <p>51 INT. STARBASE 515 SURGICAL SUITE - (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard remains motionless, even more awesomely<br>
    technological gear in the room now. The surgeon<br>
    perspires heavily; tension hangs in the air:</p>
  <p> SURGEON<br>
    The metabilation occlusions aren't<br>
    holding.</p>
  <p> A nurse hands him another set of metabilators; these<br>
    have even more contractile expediators on them. The<br>
    surgeon tries them, reacts angrily:</p>
  <p> SURGEON<br>
    Damnit! I can't stop the<br>
    heterocyclic declination! Fuse!</p>
  <p> A sharp BEAM flashes down from overhead, sending up<br>
    a puff of smoke from Picard's thorax,. It doesn't<br>
    work. The surgeon looks up, commanding now:</p>
  <p> SURGEON<br>
    Again!</p>
  <p> The BEAM flashes again. Another puff of smoke. The<br>
    surgeon sags as he realizes:</p>
  <p> SURGEON<br>
    We need a Biomolecular<br>
    Physiologist in here! This man<br>
    is dying!</p>
  <p> With that, one of the nurses reacts, bolts for the<br>
    doors and we</p>
  <p> FADE OUT:</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>52 EXT. SPACE - THE MONDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> remains in position. The Enterprise in proximity while</p>
  <p>53 INT. THE MONDOR ARMAMENT BAY - GEORDI</p>
  <p> is ushered to their relatively primitive &quot;gun turrets&quot;<br>
    by Grebnedlog and Reginod. Geordi reacts:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You've gotta be kidding.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Make us strong.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re: the armaments)<br>
    There isn't enough juice in these<br>
    to blow off a passing asteroid.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Do it. Make us strong.</p>
  <p> Geordi studies the situation carefully, finally<br>
    acknowledging:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I suppose we could increase the<br>
    anti-matter charges.</p>
  <p> REGINOD<br>
    Yes. We like power.</p>
  <p> Grebnedlog points to a set of weapon-force meters and<br>
    lights:</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Do not try to trick us. We can<br>
    tell.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> And as Geordi starts to work, we GO TO</p>
  <p>54 INT. STARBASE 515 SURGICAL SUITE - PICARD</p>
  <p> appears to be losing his battle for life, his face<br>
    increasingly ashen now as the surgeon and a<br>
    BIOMOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGIST crowd around the patient:</p>
  <p> BIOMOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGIST<br>
    Metabilation?</p>
  <p> SURGEON<br>
    Negative.</p>
  <p> BIOMOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGIST<br>
    Heterocyclics?</p>
  <p> SURGEON<br>
    Failing. And capillary integrity<br>
    too unpredictable to attempt a<br>
    resect.</p>
  <p> BIOMOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGIST<br>
    You're unwilling to make the<br>
    attempt??</p>
  <p> SURGEON<br>
    I'm not qualified.</p>
  <p> BIOMOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGIST<br>
    I know someone who is.</p>
  <p> With that, the biomolecular physiologist touches a<br>
    communications panel on the wall and we GO TO:</p>
  <p>55 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> hangs close to the Mondor while</p>
  <p>56 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING - SONYA</p>
  <p> looks up from the glow of the pool table to look<br>
    incredulously at Riker and Data:</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    Are you sure he can do it? He's<br>
    an engineer, not a weapons<br>
    specialist.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>56 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    True. But if anyone can<br>
    improvise, it's Geordi.</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    What makes you think the Pakleds<br>
    even have that kind of gear on<br>
    board?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ongoing scanning indicates<br>
    progressive weapons potential.<br>
    (then, to Riker)<br>
    The timing will be crucial. He<br>
    must correctly interpret our<br>
    intentions.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Geordi's up to speed. I trust<br>
    his instincts.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Pakleds did hear our little<br>
    fiction about Geordi's &quot;weapons<br>
    knowledge.&quot;</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Exactly. And since they obviously<br>
    equate intelligence with strength,<br>
    they won't pass up this chance<br>
    to use that knowledge.<br>
    (then, to Sonya)<br>
    Can you do it?</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    Count on it.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, Sonya's interrupted by the urgency of</p>
  <p> WORF (V.O.)<br>
    Bridge to Commander Riker!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Go ahead, bridge --</p>
  <p> WORF (V.O.)<br>
    I am receiving an emergency<br>
    summons from Starbase<br>
    five one five... Captain Picard<br>
    is close to death!</p>
  <p> Riker reacts, stunned as he looks to Data:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>56 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Sonya)<br>
    Be ready!</p>
  <p> Riker and Data exit and Sonya goes to work on the<br>
    anti-matter blender as we GO TO:</p>
  <p>57 INT. THE MONDOR - GEORDI</p>
  <p> crawls out from the weapons bay. He's had better<br>
    days, and he dusts himself off as he turns to<br>
    Grebnedlog and Reginod who react with delight as their<br>
    weapons-force meters and lights surge with new life:</p>
  <p> REGINOD<br>
    (re the meters)<br>
    We are strong.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You're now armed to the teeth.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Teeth are for chewing.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (with a patient sigh)<br>
    You have photon torpedoes. You<br>
    are strong.</p>
  <p> Grebnedlog &quot;smiles&quot; at Reginod now:</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    We are strong. We have power.</p>
  <p> And as the two Pakleds contemplate how to use their<br>
    newfound might, we GO TO:</p>
  <p>58 INT. THE ENTERPRISE MAIN BRIDGE - RIKER</p>
  <p> is in command position, Pulaski at his side, Worf at<br>
    his station, Troi nearby as Data looks up from his<br>
    scanner console, announcing:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Positive indication of armed<br>
    photon torpedoes, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Geordi did it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>58 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf turns from his security station, calling out:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Starbase requests we proceed to<br>
    base at warp nine --</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    We've got to go!</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes. Captain Picard needs our<br>
    help.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We can't leave Geordi behind --<br>
    (then, to Data)<br>
    I want the Pakleds on that screen<br>
    and I want them now!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Forced spectrum communications<br>
    are spotty at best, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do it.</p>
  <p>58A THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> comes alive with the very fuzzy, forced-spectrum image<br>
    of the Mondor bridge where Grebnedlog and Reginod are<br>
    settling into their command chairs as Geordi stands in<br>
    the b.g. and now</p>
  <p>58B RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> quickly steps before the viewscreen:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is the Enterprise. Return<br>
    our personnel or face immediate<br>
    reprisal.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    We are strong now. We have better<br>
    weapons.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you prepared to use them?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>58B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> REGINOD<br>
    We are a force now. We will have<br>
    respect. Power.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    They feel confident.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We don't have time for this. You<br>
    want power? This is power...<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Bridge to Ensign Gomez...</p>
  <p>59 INT. ENGINEERING - SONYA</p>
  <p> reacts, responds as she works furiously at some<br>
    heavy-duty anti-matter work:</p>
  <p> SONYA<br>
    Ready, Commander Riker --</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    Initiate sequencing.</p>
  <p> Sonya hits some new panels and now the engine core<br>
    begins to react with a massive ROAR while</p>
  <p>60 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - RIKER</p>
  <p> glares at the Pakleds and calls their bluff with:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Begin firing sequence countdown<br>
    from twenty-four.</p>
  <p>60AA THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Pakleds react, startled at Riker's aggressiveness<br>
    as Geordi takes his cue, leans back into the weapons<br>
    bay to make some &quot;adjustments,&quot; assuring Grebnedlog:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They mean business. Let me just<br>
    check something.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>60A INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN ENGINEERING - SONYA</p>
  <p> moves quickly, efficiently, as she works to boost<br>
    hydrogen output, as we hear:</p>
  <p> COMPUTER (V.O.)<br>
    Twenty-one... twenty...<br>
    nineteen... eighteen...</p>
  <p>60B INT. MAIN BRIDGE - RIKER</p>
  <p> stands before the viewscreen, Worf ready at his station<br>
    as they hear:</p>
  <p> COMPUTER (V.O.)<br>
    Seventeen... sixteen...<br>
    fifteen... fourteen...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Firing sequence proceeding, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hold fast.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER (V.O.)<br>
    Eleven... ten... nine...</p>
  <p>60C INT. THE MONDOR BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The Pakleds debate the wisdom of their choices now,<br>
    then turning to face Riker while Geordi works in the<br>
    b.g. furiously making his &quot;adjustments.&quot;</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    We will attack.<br>
    (re the weapons meters)<br>
    We are strong.</p>
  <p> REGINOD<br>
    (to Grebnedlog)<br>
    We should attack now.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Just another second here...</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Hurry.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>60D INT. THE ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE - RIKER</p>
  <p> reacts to what he sees on the viewscreen, looks to Worf<br>
    as they listen to:</p>
  <p> COMPUTER (V.O.)<br>
    six... five... four... three...</p>
  <p> Tension mounts as</p>
  <p>60E OMITTED</p>
  <p>60F INT. ENGINEERING - SONYA</p>
  <p> is taut, poised over her console waiting:</p>
  <p> COMPUTER (V.O)<br>
    ...two... one...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Fire!</p>
  <p> she hits the appropriate controls now and</p>
  <p>61 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> fires a heretofore unseen, unimagined blast of crimson<br>
    energy field from the leading edge of the nacelles,<br>
    fairly enveloping the Mondor in a huge, daunting shaft<br>
    of red light, accompanied by a ghostly ROAR and now</p>
  <p>62 INT. THE MONDOR BRIDGE - GEORDI</p>
  <p> looks up from his work in the weapons bay, shouts at<br>
    Grebnedlog:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Now!</p>
  <p> Grebnedlog pulls the weapons lever but suddenly, the<br>
    entire bridge is awash with a BRIGHT RED LIGHT.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Oh no! Too late!</p>
  <p> REGINOD<br>
    We have fired! They will be<br>
    destroyed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>62 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But they used the crimson<br>
    force-field --</p>
  <p> He looks toward the weapons bay and now it emits a low<br>
    GROAN. Grebnedlog looks at the weapons meters, reacts<br>
    with a sag as he realizes:</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    It did not shoot.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Their crimson force-field disarmed<br>
    us.</p>
  <p> REGINOD<br>
    (re the Enterprise;<br>
    awed)<br>
    They are smart.</p>
  <p> GEBNEDLOG<br>
    We are not strong.</p>
  <p>63 INT. THE ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> gives the final warning as he stands before the<br>
    viewscreen:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Drop your shields and let us<br>
    transport Lieutenant La Forge<br>
    immediately.</p>
  <p> Grebnedlog waves a trembling hand to a minion who pulls<br>
    a switch.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Shields are down.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Transporter Room. One to beam<br>
    to the bridge.</p>
  <p> Geordi immediately DEMATERIALIZES on the viewscreen. A<br>
    beat later, he MATERIALIZES beside Riker, turns to his<br>
    officer at CONN:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Set heading for Starbase<br>
    five one five. Warp nine.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>64 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> streaks off at warp nine as we GO TO</p>
  <p>64A INT. THE ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - RIKER</p>
  <p> stands before the viewscreen where Grebnedleg appears,<br>
    truly humbled.:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We leave you in peace.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    We want to be strong.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Weapons alone do not create<br>
    strength. You must learn<br>
    restraint.</p>
  <p> GREBNEDLOG<br>
    Yes. We will learn restraint.<br>
    Then we will be strong.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts to that with a sigh.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Off.</p>
  <p> The viewscreen goes dark as Geordi steps up:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What was that red blast?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hydrogen exhaust through the<br>
    Bussard collectors. Harmless,<br>
    but a nice light show.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Very impressive.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Did you disable their photons?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Just in time. That's why you're<br>
    all standing here...</p>
  <p>64B EXT. STARBASE FIVE-ONE-FIVE - ESTABLISHING</p>
  <p> The medical center</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>65 INT. STARBASE FIVE-ONE-FIVE SURGICAL SUITE - PICARD</p>
  <p> stirs now, his eyes slowly fluttering open. A beat.<br>
    He's alive. And then he scowls as he grumbles:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What in the hell are you doing<br>
    here?</p>
  <p>65A ANGLE - PULASKI</p>
  <p> stands over him, pulling her surgical mask down,<br>
    snapping her gloves off smartly with:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Saving your life.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh come on. This is a routine<br>
    procedure. Quite commonplace.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    True. But you are not a<br>
    commonplace man. You'll be out<br>
    of recovery in four hours.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I didn't want you involved in<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    You're welcome.</p>
  <p> He regards her obliquely. Then:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you're here... the entire crew<br>
    must know...</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    You're still the captain.<br>
    Invincible.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> She gives him a reassuring wink now as we GO TO:</p>
  <p>66 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> cruises in orbit above Starbase five one five while</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot; - 3/8/89 - ACT FIVE 63.</p>
  <p>67 INT. THE MAIN BRIDGE - RIKER</p>
  <p> is in command position, Data, Worf, Geordi, Troi, and<br>
    Wesley all in their respective positions; the<br>
    engineering station is up. The turbolift doors open<br>
    and Picard steps out. A round of applause erupts, and<br>
    Picard glares at them gruffly:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I beg your pardon.</p>
  <p> They fall silent. Geordi looks at Worf, comments:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Looks like things are back to<br>
    normal...</p>
  <p> Picard walks down to his chair, stands before it. A<br>
    beat. Then he announces:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm pleased to report that Ensign<br>
    Crusher's Starfleet exam results<br>
    will enable him to continue with<br>
    his studies on board the<br>
    Enterprise. Furthermore, any<br>
    rumors of my brush with death<br>
    are greatly exaggerated. Is that<br>
    clear?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good. Set the course for Epsilon<br>
    Sector.<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    Warp five, Ensign.</p>
  <p> Picard assumes his command position now and</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Engage.</p>
  <p>68 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> warps out of orbit as we</p>
  <p> FADE OUT:</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
