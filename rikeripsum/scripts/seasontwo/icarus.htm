  <p> STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION <br>
    &quot;The Icarus Factor&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> cruises at warp speed as we hear:</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 42686.4.<br>
    We are en route to Starbase<br>
    Montgomery for engineering<br>
    consultations prompted by minor<br>
    readout anomalies...</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN ENGINE ROOM - RIKER, DATA, AND GEORDI</p>
  <p> turn from a console station to observe the<br>
    matter/antimatter blender.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I would consider them<br>
    insignificant.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What if you're wrong?</p>
  <p> Data looks at Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Sorry.<br>
    (then)<br>
    But what if it's more than a mere<br>
    discrepancy?</p>
  <p> PICARD ENTERS.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Then I'd say we have a problem.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed. We'll have Starbase<br>
    Montgomery give us an independent<br>
    reading.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/6/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Even if the molecular level<br>
    controls failed, we could<br>
    recrystallize the dilithium<br>
    without outside help.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data, don't worry. My ego isn't<br>
    at stake here.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps we could reprogram the<br>
    system to correct the readout<br>
    variables --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's certainly an option, but<br>
    since we're stopping at Starbase<br>
    Montgomery anyway, we'll let them<br>
    do the analysis.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sir? I don't recall Starbase<br>
    Montgomery on our mission<br>
    itinerary --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think we could all use a<br>
    twelve-hour layover. Besides,<br>
    I've just received some personnel<br>
    transfer directives. Priority<br>
    matters --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Boarding or disembarking?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/8/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WESLEY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain Picard, we're within<br>
    hailing range of Starbase<br>
    Montgomery --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Reduce to impulse power --<br>
    (then, to Riker)<br>
    Meet me in the Observation Lounge<br>
    when you're done here.</p>
  <p> With that, Picard EXITS via the turbolift and we:</p>
  <p> GO TO:</p>
  <p>2A INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - PICARD</p>
  <p> is gazing out the viewports as Riker ENTERS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One, I find myself<br>
    recollecting the arrival of a new<br>
    first officer to the Enterprise<br>
    and a manual docking very<br>
    confidently achieved. I suspect<br>
    that I was somewhat miserly in<br>
    offering congratulations then,<br>
    so let me make up for it now.<br>
    Congratulations. The captain of<br>
    the Starship Ares is retiring.<br>
    You've been selected as his<br>
    replacement.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Ares... she is in Vega-Omicron<br>
    sector.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>2A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And she's picked up indications<br>
    of an intelligent life-form...<br>
    but nothing conclusive.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Starfleet will want to know<br>
    more.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's why they're asking you,<br>
    Number One. Not for your military<br>
    proficiency, but for your skill<br>
    as an explorer and diplomat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Vega-Omicron. It'll take months<br>
    at high warp just to get there.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    With no guarantee of finding<br>
    anything once you arrive. Well,<br>
    you have twelve hours to think<br>
    it over. And maybe it's premature,<br>
    but congratulations, &quot;Captain.&quot;</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>3 EXT. STARBASE MONTGOMERY - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> moves into position above a well-established planetary<br>
    outpost while:</p>
  <p>4 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - PICARD</p>
  <p> sits in his Command Chair, Data at Ops, WORF at<br>
    Tactical, WESLEY at Conn, as Riker ENTERS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Establish synchronous orbit.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Riker as he approaches:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Starbase Montgomery is sending<br>
    a civilian advisor aboard to brief<br>
    you on the Ares's mission.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A personal briefing?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. Strategic attache with<br>
    specialized knowledge of the<br>
    frontier regions. I think you'll<br>
    find the briefing... very<br>
    interesting.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I hope it's complete. Much of<br>
    my decision will be based on it.</p>
  <p> HERBERT'S COM VOICE<br>
    Commander Riker to the Transporter<br>
    Room.</p>
  <p> Riker heads for the turbolift.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Enjoy...</p>
  <p> Riker steps into the turbolift and we:</p>
  <p> GO TO:</p>
  <p>5 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - RIKER</p>
  <p> ENTERS, steps up to ENSIGN HERBERT, who is monitoring<br>
    his console.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ensign --</p>
  <p> HERBERT<br>
    Ah, you're right on time,<br>
    Commander. He's on his way now...</p>
  <p> Herbert works his magic on the console and now he and<br>
    Riker look up at:</p>
  <p>6 THE TRANSPORTER PAD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> where the FORM OF A MAN MATERIALIZES, and as it starts<br>
    to be more clearly defined:</p>
  <p>7 RIKER</p>
  <p> realizes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Dad... ?</p>
  <p>8 KYLE RIKER</p>
  <p> steps down from the Transporter Pad, walks right up to<br>
    Riker, studies him just as Riker studies his father.<br>
    Kyle's a jut-jawed, extremely fit, silver-haired<br>
    civilian in his fifties. As they eyeball each other:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>9 RIKER</p>
  <p> assumes Academy courtesy: Polite, detached,<br>
    unemotional.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're the civilian advisor? The<br>
    strategic attache?</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    I asked Captain Picard to keep<br>
    it quiet. I didn't want you to<br>
    get nervous... excited.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's been fifteen years.<br>
    Excitement is hardly the<br>
    appropriate emotion.</p>
  <p> Kyle purses his lips, considers that, then counters:</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    You've done well. First officer<br>
    on the Enterprise is quite a<br>
    feather in your cap.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've worked hard.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Of course. I'm proud of you,<br>
    Will --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If you'll excuse me, I've got my<br>
    duties to attend to. After you've<br>
    settled in, we'll complete the<br>
    briefing.<br>
    (then, to Herbert)<br>
    Have security send an escort for<br>
    this gentleman.</p>
  <p> With that, Riker about-faces and EXITS, leaving Kyle to<br>
    share an awkward moment with Ensign Herbert as we:</p>
  <p> GO TO:</p>
  <p>10 INT. CORRIDOR - WESLEY</p>
  <p> turns a corner, catches up with Worf and walks beside<br>
    him as:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Did you hear about Commander<br>
    Riker's promotion?</p>
  <p> Worf barely acknowledges Wesley, obviously upset by<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    He didn't even know his father<br>
    was coming. It was a complete<br>
    surprise --</p>
  <p> Worf stops in mid-stride, turning toward Wesley grimly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    So?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Well, can you imagine if it was<br>
    your father?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I never knew my father.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    And I didn't have one long<br>
    enough --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is a waste of time to think<br>
    about such things.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm not thinking about it, really,<br>
    but everybody needs somebody,<br>
    don't you think -- ?</p>
  <p> Worf glares at Wesley, fairly barking:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Enough!</p>
  <p> Worf drills Wesley with his intensity, then marches<br>
    off, leaving Wesley a bit shaken as we:</p>
  <p> GO TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/8/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>11 INT. MAIN ENGINE ROOM - GEORDI</p>
  <p> weaves through a TRIO OF STARBASE MONTGOMERY TECHS and<br>
    a TRIO OF ENTERPRISE TECHS as they run their analysis.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Starbase Montgomery really didn't<br>
    have to send me all this help,<br>
    because we've already checked the<br>
    entire dilithium spectrum for<br>
    anomalous frequencies, so don't<br>
    waste your time on that --</p>
  <p> Just then, Wesley ENTERS, ashen faced.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Wes... you okay?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I was just talking to Worf.<br>
    (then)<br>
    He's somewhat eccentric at times.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's one word for it.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But he was so upset -- I must've<br>
    said something wrong.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe Worf's not too thrilled<br>
    with the idea of losing Commander<br>
    Riker to a new assignment. I'm<br>
    sure not --</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Neither am I... But I think<br>
    it's something else with Worf...<br>
    something's really bothering<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> Geordi considers that, exchanging a look of concern<br>
    with Wesley now as we:</p>
  <p> GO TO:</p>
  <p>12 INT. TEN-FORWARD - PULASKI</p>
  <p> sits at the bar with a couple of n.d. MEDICAL CREW<br>
    STAFF, enjoying some down time.</p>
  <p> PULL BACK to reveal:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>13 RIKER</p>
  <p> at a corner table with Chief O'Brien, with a cup of<br>
    steaming tea. He sips the tea.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Female?</p>
  <p> Riker does not reply.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Career?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Family.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    That is trouble. You choose your<br>
    friends... you choose your<br>
    enemies... But family... that's<br>
    in the stars.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So I've heard.</p>
  <p> As he sips:</p>
  <p>14 KYLE RIKER</p>
  <p> ENTERS and immediately spots some people he knows.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Boliska! What in the name of<br>
    the Federation are you doing<br>
    here -- ?</p>
  <p> He goes over and shakes hands with BOLISKA who is with<br>
    a couple of other old n.d. friends, then spots:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>15 PULASKI</p>
  <p> who visibly reacts at the sight of Kyle. She slowly<br>
    rises, turning to her tablemates:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Excuse me...</p>
  <p> She crosses the room; he does the same, and as they<br>
    come within whispering range:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This is more than a surprise...<br>
    it's total shock.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    You mean you didn't bake me a<br>
    cake?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    You're actually here.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    That makes two of us.<br>
    (then, re an empty<br>
    table)<br>
    How about a drink?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    How about a kiss?</p>
  <p> He smiles at that, kisses her lightly and then they<br>
    exchange a warmly mutual embrace while:</p>
  <p>16 RIKER</p>
  <p> turns to O'Brien with:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They know each other...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I know her too, but we don't do<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> And as they both react to Kyle's familiarity with<br>
    Pulaski, we:</p>
  <p> GO TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/8/89 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>17 INT. MAIN ENGINE ROOM - GEORDI, DATA, AND WESLEY</p>
  <p> move around the dilithium chamber, watching the<br>
    starbase crew go about their analysis while:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And it has nothing to do with<br>
    Commander Riker's new assignment?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No. His reaction to that was just<br>
    the opposite of mine: Completely<br>
    unaffected.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You see? With all that's going<br>
    on, you might be overreacting.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Really? You try talking to Worf.<br>
    I'm telling you, he's not...<br>
    normal... for Worf.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is, of course, a genetic<br>
    predisposition toward hostility<br>
    among all Klingons, although Worf<br>
    does seem unusually out of sorts.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    He's never been much on charm --</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Well, whatever troubles him, we<br>
    should try to help. He is our<br>
    friend.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    And I'd like to keep him<br>
    friendly.<br>
    (then)<br>
    Any suggestions?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Empirical study. Monitor the<br>
    subject.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Right. We'll watch for any<br>
    signs of unusual behavior --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That shouldn't be difficult --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Within the norms of Klingon<br>
    patterns, of course.<br>
    (then)<br>
    Discretion will be required.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Fine. Where do we start?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re himself and Data)<br>
    We... will assist you as needed.<br>
    (then)<br>
    You found the problem...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And you must solve it.</p>
  <p> With that, Data and Geordi walk off, leaving Wesley<br>
    wondering what he's gotten himself into now, as we:</p>
  <p> GO TO:</p>
  <p>18 INT. TEN-FORWARD - RIKER</p>
  <p> downs the last of his tea, looks across the room at:</p>
  <p>19 PULASKI AND KYLE</p>
  <p> who sit together at the bar, obviously enjoying each<br>
    other's company.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    ... and after working out the<br>
    Fuurinkazan battle strategies<br>
    at the Tokyo Base, I was asked<br>
    to go to work for Starfleet as<br>
    a tactical advisor.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I'm surprised you stayed away from<br>
    the action as long as you did --</p>
  <p> Just then, Riker steps up, having overheard that last<br>
    line.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Hi, Will -- join us? Your father<br>
    and I were just catching up --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (ignoring that; to<br>
    Pulaski)<br>
    You never told me you knew him.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Well... it wasn't exactly a<br>
    secret... but it never really came<br>
    up --</p>
  <p> Kyle looks up smiling, offering:</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Pull up a stool, son --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm ready for your briefing<br>
    whenever you are, sir.</p>
  <p> And as he EXITS, Kyle looks after him, his concern<br>
    growing, as we:</p>
  <p>20 OMITTED</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT ONE </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/13/89 - ACT TWO 15.</p>
  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>A21 INT. CORRIDOR - DATA AND GEORDI</p>
  <p> are approaching the doors to Ten-Forward.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You think Worf is going to<br>
    appreciate being observed like<br>
    some laboratory specimen?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are correct. He is not<br>
    insensitive... particularly at<br>
    this stage of his development.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Just remember, this is Wesley's<br>
    operation, okay?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Wesley is quite competent.</p>
  <p> Just as they approach Ten-Forward, Wesley steps up,<br>
    agitated.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You guys aren't going to believe<br>
    this...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Believe what?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Commander Riker just caught me<br>
    coming out of the turbolift.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So? This area isn't off limits<br>
    to you.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I know, but I've been working on<br>
    Paracelsian computations as part<br>
    of my studies and he wants them<br>
    right away.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What about Worf?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/12/89 - ACT TWO 15A.</p>
  <p>A21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    When Commander Riker says right<br>
    away he means right away.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Indeed.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (re Ten-Forward)<br>
    You guys can cover for me, can't<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Wait a minute. This whole<br>
    thing --</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I've got to get my computations<br>
    done.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You don't expect us to --</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Oh, come on. What are friends<br>
    for?<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Right?</p>
  <p> Data reacts, very much put on the spot; then:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Go ahead. Finish your work and<br>
    We shall study Worf.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I knew I could count on you guys!</p>
  <p> With that, Wesley heads off down the corridor, leaving<br>
    Data to face Geordi, as we:</p>
  <p> GO TO:</p>
  <p>21 INT. TEN-FORWARD - PULASKI AND KYLE</p>
  <p> are at the bar, Kyle just shaking hands with an old<br>
    acquaintance as Geordi and Data find a table in the<br>
    b.g.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    ... good seeing you too, Graham --</p>
  <p> As GRAHAM heads off, Pulaski smiles.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/10/89 - ACT TWO 15B.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    You wouldn't be running for mayor,<br>
    would you?</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Do pick-up work for the Federation<br>
    long enough and it'll happen to<br>
    you, too.<br>
    (then)<br>
    I thought about you a lot.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Kyle... I don't need to hear what<br>
    you don't need to say.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    We could've been great together.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Possibly.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Is it true you got married?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Again... and again.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Doesn't that make you three for<br>
    three?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I'm not complaining. They were<br>
    each good men... and we're all<br>
    still good friends.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT TWO 16.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Like us?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Close... but different.<br>
    (then)<br>
    They were all a little more...<br>
    in touch with themselves.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Ouch.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Kyle, face facts. You're<br>
    crusty. A reputation for being<br>
    hard as nails and getting the<br>
    job done. But underneath all<br>
    that, you're not so bad. Some<br>
    of us even love you.<br>
    (then)<br>
    And then there's Will.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    And then there's Will.</p>
  <p> And as he considers his feelings for his son, we:</p>
  <p> FOCUS ON:</p>
  <p>22 WORF (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> standing at the large viewport, staring out at the<br>
    galaxy, very much alone with his thoughts.</p>
  <p>23 GEORDI AND DATA</p>
  <p> study Worf from their vantage point in the b.g.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Wesley really should be doing this<br>
    on his own --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But he needs his study time --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I can't believe you fell for that.<br>
    (then, re Worf)<br>
    I don't know... he looks pretty<br>
    normal to me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Icarus Factor&quot; - 2/2/89 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In solitude there is nothing to<br>
    trigger unusual behavior.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    Good point. Let's not tamper with<br>
    the status quo...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That would defeat the opportunity<br>
    for our behavioral research.<br>
    (then)<br>
    The probabilities are that he's<br>
    simply lonely. We can relieve<br>
    his anxieties through<br>
    socialization --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re Worf)<br>
    Be my guest.</p>
  <p> Data approaches Worf from the rear.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Excuse me, Lieutenant --</p>
  <p> Worf doesn't turn around or make the slightest reply.<br>
    Data presses on.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You seem to have lost the will<br>
    to communicate with others.</p>
  <p> Still no response from Worf. Data persists.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You have friends here. We care<br>
    about you. Why, just awhile ago,<br>
    Wesley, Geordi and I were saying<br>
    how --</p>
  <p> Worf suddenly wheels around, glaring down at Data with<br>
    Klingon ferocity as he bellows in his deepest baritone:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir... with all due respect...<br>
    BE GONE!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Data backs away and returns to Geordi's side.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He seems quite sincere in his<br>
    desire for solitude.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (smugly, the pun<br>
    intentional)<br>
    Seeing is believing, huh?</p>
  <p> With that, Geordi and Data beat a hasty retreat, as we:</p>
  <p> GO TO:</p>
  <p>24 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS - RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> stands at a viewing console, tapping the touchpad<br>
    occasionally as he goes through a series of childhood<br>
    &quot;photos.&quot; A TONE is heard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> The door slides open and Worf ENTERS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    May I have a moment, sir?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is difficult to say... words<br>
    are not always easy for me...<br>
    (then, distracted by<br>
    the pictures)<br>
    Is that Earth?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes. Alaska... I was nine<br>
    there...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (intrigued; re the<br>
    picture)<br>
    That is a big fish you are<br>
    holding.</p>
  <p> Riker considers that, then admits:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re the picture)<br>
    I didn't even catch that fish.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You were holding it like --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I hooked it... but my father took<br>
    the pole... wouldn't even let me<br>
    reel it in... he said I might lose<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You do not have good feelings<br>
    for your father?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm... not sure how I feel right<br>
    now...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You have much on your mind.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes.<br>
    (then)<br>
    What is on yours?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (2</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The Enterprise has been good to<br>
    me...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    To all of us.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It has been my home... but still,<br>
    I am alone here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not true. You have many friends<br>
    here, just as I have --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Then why do you make ready to<br>
    leave the Enterprise?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've been offered my own command,<br>
    something I've trained for...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    And what of your friends?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Friendship is something we carry<br>
    in our hearts... We can feel it<br>
    wherever we are.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes. On Kling we say, &quot;Tez mrot<br>
    weilz konpadam&quot;: One is always<br>
    of his tribe.<br>
    (then)<br>
    I would like to join you on the<br>
    Ares.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you, Worf. But I haven't<br>
    accepted the assignment yet --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But sir... it could be a<br>
    dangerous mission. There may<br>
    be the potential for combat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's not the purpose of the<br>
    mission.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT TWO 20A.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Still -- to die a true hero --</p>
  <p> Riker raises his hand.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf. Your point is made.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Then I know you will do the right<br>
    thing, sir.</p>
  <p> With that, Worf EXITS, as we:</p>
  <p> GO TO:</p>
  <p>25 OMITTED</p>
  <p>26 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - LATER - KYLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> turns to face Riker who ENTERS:</p>

  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Finally. We're alone. Maybe --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm here for the briefing, sir.</p>
  <p> Kyle reacts, sees that Riker is all business. Kyle<br>
    hands him a message disk.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    All you need to know is here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The mission details could've been<br>
    transmitted --</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    I've been hearing good things<br>
    about you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why didn't I ever hear from you?</p>
  <p> Kyle reacts to that, studies the floor for a beat;<br>
    then:</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    I know. Keeping in touch isn't<br>
    my strong suit.<br>
    (then)<br>
    Funny thing about being a parent.<br>
    There aren't any tech manuals,<br>
    no quick readouts to get you to<br>
    the next set of variables. You<br>
    just kind of wing it from day to<br>
    day... Will, when your mother<br>
    died --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Excuse me, sir, but I need to<br>
    study this briefing material...</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Will. I came to the Enterprise<br>
    because... look, considering<br>
    where you might be going, I wanted<br>
    to...<br>

  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (re the patient)<br>
    Poor guy. Picked up a flu virus<br>

  <p> PULASKI<br>

    You've still got the touch,<br>
    haven't you?</p>
  <p> Just then, TROI ENTERS in the b.g., overhearing.</p>

    I like to help. When they hurt,<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Commander Pulaski's greatest<br>
    medical skill is her empathy.<br>

    You must be Commander Riker's<br>
    father.</p>
  <p> He reacts, smiles, a bit nonplussed.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Yes, but how --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We've all heard about you.<br>
    (then)<br>
    And I've felt certain things.</p>
  <p> Kyle reacts, glances at Pulaski, who smiles at his<br>
    discomfort, then explains by way of introduction:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    This is Deanna Troi, ship's<br>
    counselor.</p>

    Why do I get the feeling this is<br>
    a set-up?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Because you are intelligent,<br>

    appreciatively)<br>
    I've been set up with worse,<br>
    that's for sure --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're also anxious about<br>
    something. It's your son, isn't<br>
    it? You're not as close to him<br>
    as you'd like to be...</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    (wryly)<br>
    Oh, I don't know. Wouldn't you<br>
    say we both have pretty good taste<br>
    in women?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'd like to help if I can. If<br>
    you allow me.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Fine. What do you want from me?<br>
    I came here to bury the hatchet<br>
    with Will and I find out the<br>
    ground is frozen solid.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're not the kind of man who<br>
    gives up so easily.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    I didn't say I was giving up.<br>
    It would just be nice to get a<br>
    little something from him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

  <p> KYLE<br>
    I don't know. Acknowledgement,<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Respect is earned, not bestowed.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Respect? I don't need that from<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Perhaps you want him to be proud<br>
    of you, for you carry great pride<br>

  <p> KYLE<br>
    Absolutely! Look at him! First<br>
    officer on the Enterprise, just<br>
    offered his first command --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

  <p> KYLE<br>
    Please. He'd be lucky to have<br>

    And false humility.</p>
  <p> Kyle reacts to that with a smile. Then:</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    My guess is that Will finds you<br>
    pretty fascinating. Candor seems<br>
    to be a trait he admires.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Honesty is the trait he admires.<br>
    (then)<br>
    You're very competitive with him,<br>
    aren't you?</p>
  <p> He reacts to that, considers it, then dismisses it.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Maybe... in the past. But I'm<br>
    here to help Will prepare for his<br>
    first mission as captain.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Are you sure he'll accept such<br>
    a dangerous assignment?</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>

    so dangerous.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How can you be so sure?</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Because I would. And we aren't<br>
    so different, Will and I...</p>
  <p> GO TO:</p>
  <p>31 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS - PICARD</p>
  <p> stands to one side, watching Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've seen your mission briefing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/9/89 - ACT THREE 26A.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any questions?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No sir.<br>
    (then)<br>
    Other than a mention of the Ares's<br>
    first officer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    His name is Flaherty, as I recall.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's right. The briefing said<br>
    something about uncanny linguistic<br>
    skills.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Correct. The last time I saw him,<br>
    Commander Flaherty spoke over<br>
    forty languages. Klingon,<br>
    Romulan, Giamon, and Stroyerian<br>
    were among the more colorful, as<br>
    I recall...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He speaks alien dialects?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He has the unique ability of<br>
    instantaneously interpreting,<br>
    collating, and extrapolating any<br>
    verbal communication he hears.<br>
    (then)<br>
    You should find him helpful in<br>
    Sector Vega-Omicron.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sure I will.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT THREE 27.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Suddenly, they're both distracted by the DOOR CHIME.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Enter.</p>
  <p> Kyle ENTERS, all smiles as he greets Picard.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Captain Picard. At last.<br>
    (re Riker)<br>
    I'd like to thank you for all the<br>
    help you've been to my son --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My only regret is that your<br>
    reunion will mark Will's farewell.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    (re Riker)<br>
    He's ready for this command.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have no doubt --</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Captain? May I have a word with<br>
    my son?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course... excuse me,<br>
    gentlemen...</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS; Riker turns to face his father.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I won't be pushed into this.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    Oh, come on, Willy. Don't you<br>
    think you're ready for the<br>
    Ares -- ?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Starfleet does.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Of course. You're the best<br>
    candidate for this job. But I<br>
    want you to know I'm here if you<br>
    need me...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've been on my own since I was<br>
    fifteen. I can take care of<br>
    myself.</p>
  <p> Kyle reacts, begins to bristle.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Please! Spare me the &quot;pain&quot; of<br>
    your childhood. I hung in there<br>
    for thirteen years. If that<br>
    wasn't enough, then that's just<br>
    too bad.</p>
  <p> With that, Kyle turns to the door. It opens. He<br>
    EXITS. The door closes, as we:</p>
  <p> GO TO:</p>
  <p>32 INT. MAIN ENGINE ROOM - GEORDI AND DATA</p>
  <p> are observing the Starbase Montgomery crew as they<br>
    continue their analysis of the situation. Geordi is<br>
    beginning to feel the pressure.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe I missed something --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The ship's computer would have<br>
    corrected immediately --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    My inputs could have been in<br>
    error --</p>
  <p> Just then, Wesley ENTERS with a sense of urgency.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Geordi! Data! I figured out<br>
    Worf's problem --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You spoke to him?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No, no. I accessed the complete<br>
    Klingon cultural database. It<br>
    took some time, but --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay, Wesley. What is the<br>
    problem?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's the tenth anniversary of<br>
    Worf's Age of Ascension.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    His what?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    The Age of Ascension is a<br>
    Klingon ritual of great<br>
    significance. A rite of<br>
    initiation, marking a new level<br>
    of Klingon spiritual attainment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Of what significance is the<br>
    anniversary of this event?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's a day of ritual and<br>
    celebration with one's fellow<br>
    Klingons... and he doesn't have<br>
    any Klingon friends.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But we're his friends --</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But we don't practice Klingon<br>
    tradition. And we're not<br>
    Klingons.<br>
    (then)<br>
    Worf's feeling socially...<br>
    culturally isolated.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, what do you suggest? I'm<br>
    not sure I'd like to invite a<br>
    bunch of Klingons on board --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We can program the ship's computer<br>
    to provide us with simulations<br>
    on the Holodeck --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Holographic Klingons? Sure. Why<br>
    not?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/8/89 - ACT THREE 30A.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We need only to program the<br>
    computer with details of the<br>
    specific ceremony...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    The cultural database said the<br>
    initiate's family must be<br>
    present --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/9/89 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So? We're his family. We'll go.<br>
    (then)<br>
    I just wonder what kind of party<br>
    the Klingons had in mind...</p>
  <p> And as they all react to that consideration, we:</p>
  <p> GO TO:</p>
  <p>33 INT. PULASKI'S OFFICE - PULASKI</p>
  <p> is working as Riker ENTERS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you have a minute?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Sure...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I wanted to apologize for my<br>
    remarks in Ten-Forward. Your past<br>
    is none of my business.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Even if it involves your father?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes. Even if it involves my<br>
    father.</p>
  <p> Pulaski sits quietly for a moment, then asks:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Did he ever tell you why he never<br>
    remarried?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What woman would have him? With<br>
    an ego like his --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I would have. In a cold minute.<br>
    (then)<br>
    Twelve years ago, Kyle Riker was<br>
    a civilian strategist advising<br>
    Starfleet in its conflict with<br>
    the Tholians. The starbase he<br>
    was working from was attacked.<br>
    None of the base crew was expected<br>
    to live. And they all died...<br>
    All except your father.<br>
    (then, quietly)<br>
    Your father alone had the will<br>
    to endure, to face the pain, to<br>
    live.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I never knew that about him.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I never saw a man fight so hard<br>
    in my life.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And you fell in love?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Yes. And so did he.<br>
    (then)<br>
    But marriage was out of the<br>
    question. He had other<br>
    priorities...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    His career.</p>
  <p> She considers that, then offers:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    You know, if I were you... going<br>
    out on the Ares, I'd jettison<br>
    the emotional baggage you're<br>
    still carrying around.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Pulaski EXITS and we:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT THREE </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/8/89 - ACT FOUR 34.</p>
  <p> ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>34 INT. ENGINEERING - DATA, WESLEY, AND GEORDI</p>
  <p> stand near Geordi's engineering station, the Starbase<br>
    Montgomery techs working in the b.g.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Now the Klingon cultural database<br>
    was very specific on the setting.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Let me guess: A twenty-piece<br>
    orchestra in a magnificent<br>
    ballroom. Everybody in formal<br>
    wear --</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    There's an unusual test of<br>
    inner strength involved --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe that will entail the<br>
    use of Klingon &quot;painstiks.&quot;</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    &quot;Painstiks&quot;? Sounds lovely --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Enduring physical suffering is<br>
    considered a Klingon spiritual<br>
    test.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You mean... for Worf to celebrate<br>
    the anniversary of his<br>
    Ascension... he has to be hurt?<br>
    And we have to witness this?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/8/89 - ACT FOUR 35.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED:</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Everything in order, Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'd be a fool to turn this<br>
    promotion down, wouldn't I?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT FOUR 36.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know, and if you're<br>
    asking me what I think you should<br>
    do, I don't know that either.<br>
    But I can spell out, albeit<br>
    crudely, what you are choosing<br>
    between.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Your present position as first<br>
    officer of the Enterprise brings<br>
    you prestige, distinction, even<br>
    glamour of a kind. You are the<br>
    second in command of Starfleet's<br>
    flagship -- but still, second in<br>
    command. Your promotion will<br>
    transfer you to a relatively<br>
    insignificant ship in an obscure<br>
    corner of the galaxy, but it will<br>
    be your ship. Being who you are,<br>
    that ship will vibrate with your<br>
    authority, your style, your<br>
    vision. There is no substitute<br>
    for being in the center of the<br>
    stage -- any stage.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll need a little more time<br>
    before I'll have a decision.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Granted.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts to that, as we:</p>
  <p> GO TO:</p>
  <p>36 INT. ENGINEERING - DATA AND GEORDI</p>
  <p> stand on the platform above the Starbase Montgomery<br>
    team, watching them go through their painstaking<br>

  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    They find anything yet?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not yet...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is nothing to find.</p>

    No harm in checking, I guess.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Really? How would you like<br>
    them giving your transporter<br>
    operation a little once-over?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    No problem. We're totally<br>
    ship-shape.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You miss the point. It's just<br>
    the idea that they even suspect<br>
    a malfunction.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi, let them look.</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Chief, will you be able to attend<br>
    a little party for Worf at<br>
    seventeen hundred hours?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    A party for Worf? That sounds<br>
    intriguing. I'd be delighted --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's a surprise, okay?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    My lips are sealed.</p>
  <p> Data, Geordi, and Wesley respond enthusiastically to<br>

    you right now.</p>
  <p> He takes a tentative step toward her, suggesting:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe your own feelings are<br>
    getting in the way --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    My job is to help others sort<br>
    out their emotions. My own<br>
    feelings are beside the point --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not to me. Feelings are what<br>
    make us human --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (then, hopefully)<br>
    Are you feeling sadness?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> She looks at him, a tear slipping down her cheek now.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

  <p> Data looks to Geordi, who wonders:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    If we're going to get Worf through<br>
    his problem, it is.</p>
  <p> Data steps back. Then:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Computer... may we please have<br>
    Klingon personnel appropriate for<br>
    this event?</p>
  <p> Suddenly, EIGHT FORMIDABLE KLINGONS appear along the<br>
    sides of the trough. They each hold an exotic,<br>
    cattle-prod-like &quot;painstik.&quot; Everyone reacts to the<br>
    sudden appearance of the Klingons.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    These images are specifically<br>
    programmed for Ascension rites.</p>

    a two-ton Rectyne Monopod. Poor<br>
    creature jumped five meters at<br>
    the slightest touch. Finally died<br>

  <p> The Holodeck doors open. Worf reacts, sucking his<br>
    breath in with great glee as he sees:</p>
  <p>46 INT. HOLODECK - THE RITE OF ASCENSION CHAMBER</p>
  <p> populated now by his Enterprise comrades who all stand<br>
    off to one side, the eight Klingon holographs standing<br>
    along the trough, forming a rather forbidding gauntlet<br>
    as they hold their painstiks at the ready. Worf<br>
    ENTERS, almost teary-eyed as he regards Data, Wesley,<br>
    Pulaski, Geordi, and O'Brien.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    An Ascension ceremony? For me?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    The true test of Klingon strength<br>
    is to admit one's most profound<br>
    feelings... while under extreme<br>
    duress.</p>
  <p> Geordi and Wesley nod, impressed as they turn now to<br>
    see Worf step down into the trough. At a processional<br>
    pace, he begins the walk down the channel, coming<br>
    between two of the Klingons. He looks at them with<br>
    great sincerity.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    jIbechrup may' vIlos.</p>
  <p> Whereupon the first two Klingons jab painstiks at Worf,<br>
    sparks flying off the end as Worf writhes in absolute,<br>
    breathtaking agony. After a moment, they pull the<br>
    painstiks from Worf. Worf's voice is weak as he<br>
    growls:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The battle is mine. I crave only<br>
    the blood of the enemy.</p>

    next pair of Klingons.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

  <p> The Klingons strike out with the painstiks; and, as<br>
    contact is made, sparks fly and Worf's body contorts<br>
    in wretched agony. They break contact with the<br>
    painstiks now and Worf fights for equilibrium,<br>
    shuddering with the pain of this as he utters hoarsely:</p>

  <p> Pulaski looks over to Data, who finds this difficult,<br>
    reacting with a start as the Klingons nail Worf with<br>
    their painstiks; he falls to his knees, twitching<br>
    violently, and, as Worf fights for control, they remove<br>
    the painstiks. Worf collapses at the end of the<br>
    trough, rolls over, and... smiles at them all,<br>
    whispering:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Thank you, my friends. Thank<br>
    you... You have my respect. My<br>
    admiration. My eternal gratitude --</p>

    Is Worf all right?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    He's never been happier.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Then it was a good ceremony?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Let's just say I wasn't about to<br>
    stay for the refreshments.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Klingon culture is not to your<br>

  <p>47A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I'm just glad humans have<br>
    progressed beyond the need for<br>
    such barbaric displays.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Have they? Commander Riker and<br>
    his father are up on the Holodeck<br>
    about to engage in barbarism of<br>
    their own.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Don't remind me. It's not<br>
    something of which I approve --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    In spite of human evolution, there<br>
    seem to be certain traits endemic<br>
    to gender.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    You think they're going to knock<br>
    each other's brains out just<br>
    because... they're men?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Males are certainly unique. In<br>
    adulthood, fathers continue to<br>
    regard their sons as children...<br>
    and sons continue to chafe against<br>
    what they perceive as their<br>
    fathers' expectations of them.</p>
  <p> Pulaski considers that for a beat; then:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    It's almost as if they never<br>
    really grow up at all, isn't it?</p>

    Perhaps that's why men remain so<br>
    attractive.</p>

  <p> PULASKI<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/8/89 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p>49 INT. GYMNASIUM - RIKER AND KYLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> approach an exotic combat arena, wearing anbo-jyutsu<br>
    gear which consists of snug face shield and helmet,<br>
    abdomen shield, and slender pads on all other vital<br>
    areas. They carry anbo-jyutsu staffs, tapered on one<br>
    end, padded on the other, with a reostat twist-shaft<br>
    in the center grip. The arena itself is a ring<br>
    fourteen feet in diameter.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Anbo-jyutsu. The ultimate<br>
    evolution of the martial arts.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I remember my early lessons.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    You could never get used to the<br>
    sightless factor... or to losing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    True. But I've had fifteen years<br>
    of practice.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Then let's see if you've learned<br>
    anything...</p>
  <p> Riker considers that, accepts the challenge formally<br>
    as he stiffens, then bows quickly and flips the<br>
    blind-shield down in front of his face. Kyle does the<br>
    same, as they shout in unison:</p>
  <p> RIKER KYLE<br>
    Yoroshiku-onegaishimasu! Yoroshiku-onegaishimasu!</p>
  <p> And the battle begins as each man stalks the other with<br>
    the tapered end of his staff. The closer the staff's<br>
    tip comes to the opponent, the louder a series of BEEPS<br>
    which are emitted. Kyle finds Riker's leg, swiftly<br>
    swings his staff at Riker, but as he does, of course,<br>
    the BEEPS cease as the tapered end moves away from the<br>
    target, allowing Riker to dodge the blow.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> (Silence from the opponent's staff means that he's<br>
    taking a swing and cues a defensive move.) As Kyle<br>
    recovers from the missed blow, Riker suddenly reverses<br>
    direction, swings, and knocks Kyle's feet out from<br>
    under him and, as he tumbles to the mat outside the<br>
    ring, the POINT BUZZER SOUNDS.</p>
  <p> Both men flip up their blind-shields as Kyle regains<br>
    his feet and re-enters the ring.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    You have been practicing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And remembering.<br>
    (then)<br>
    You never should've let her die.</p>
  <p> Riker flips his blind-shield down, quickly bowing,<br>
    shouting:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yoroshiku-onegaishimasu.</p>
  <p> Kyle reacts, pleased; then:</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Good. Get it all out!</p>
  <p> Now Kyle flips his blind-shield down again, quickly<br>
    bowing, shouting:</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Yoroshiku-onegaishimasu.</p>
  <p> They stalk one another again. Riker makes a brilliant<br>
    move, but somehow Kyle artfully avoids his son's blow.<br>
    Riker reacts, frustrated and amazed as he shouts:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Matta!</p>
  <p> The action stops. They each flip up their<br>
    blind-shields, Riker furrowing his brow curiously.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I had you.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Will, listen. You were too young<br>
    to understand -- and I was too hurt<br>
    to explain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You've never been hurt by<br>
    anything.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    She was your mother, but she was<br>
    my wife -- and when she died...<br>
    all that kept me going was you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You had a strange way of showing<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Damnit, Will -- you were barely<br>
    out of diapers. You hardly knew<br>
    her. I loved her. Of course<br>
    you've had the pain... and so have<br>
    I. I should have tried to<br>
    explain all of this long ago,<br>
    but it hurt too much. Then a<br>
    wall went up between us... and<br>
    living there, just you and me...<br>
    the wall got bigger.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why didn't we move away? Start<br>
    over?</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    I promised her. It was the life<br>
    she wanted for you... so...<br>
    (shrugs it off)<br>
    I came here thinking we could<br>
    talk this out. But maybe you're<br>
    right. Maybe I'm no father at<br>
    all... and you're no son. Maybe<br>
    this... this fight is all we have<br>
    left.</p>
  <p> Kyle flips his blind-shield down again; Riker<br>
    hesitates, studying his father for a long beat. Then<br>
    they bow and face off once again, as Riker calls upon<br>
    all his stamina to avoid his father's clever blows,<br>
    summoning an inner reserve of will and determination as<br>
    he deftly parries Kyle's offensive move, suddenly<br>
    freezing in his tracks with:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Matta!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Icarus... &quot; - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> They both flip up their blind-shields, Kyle looking<br>
    confident, Riker appearing frustrated.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    What is it now?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You can't do that!</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    (feigning innocence)<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hachidan kiritsu! That's<br>
    illegal --</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    You're kidding.</p>
  <p> Riker studies his father for a long beat, his eyes<br>
    suddenly twinkling with the realization.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All those years... That's why I<br>
    could never win... you were<br>
    cheating!</p>
  <p> Kyle smiles guiltily, a bit embarrassed, as he removes<br>
    his helmet and shrugs.</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Hey, it worked. Kept you coming<br>
    back for more.</p>
  <p> Riker can't help himself as an incredible wave of<br>
    relief washes over him and removes his helmet as he<br>
    starts laughing with:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I always hated that... and you<br>
    were just cheating! Incredible!<br>
    How'd you get away with it?</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    You were just a kid.<br>
    (then, admitting)<br>
    Once you were twelve, I knew I<br>
    couldn't take you... but I had<br>
    to keep you interested...<br>
    challenged... didn't I?<br>

    Y'know, I can talk to a roomful<br>

    to you about how I feel?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How do you feel?</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    How do you think, Will?<br>
    (then)<br>
    I love you, son.</p>
  <p> Riker is rocked by Kyle's candor, his facade crumbling.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Really?</p>
  <p> KYLE<br>
    Really.</p>
  <p> Now Riker and Kyle embrace in a gripping, passionately<br>
    courageous and manful hug. There may or may not be<br>
    tears; there is certainly mutual love, as Kyle looks<br>
    his son squarely in the eye.</p>
