    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is in orbit around a red/brown planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43917.4<br>
    The Enterprise has been given the<br>
    singular honor of hosting the<br>
    first face to face meeting between<br>
    the Federation and the mysterious<br>
    race of beings known as the<br>
    Legarans. We are in orbit around<br>
    Vulcan preparing to welcome aboard<br>
    the Federation ambassador that<br>
    has made this historic event<br>
    possible.</p>
  <p>2 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> PICARD and RIKER are walking to the Transporter Room.<br>
    They are in dress uniforms.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (slightly awed)<br>
    I can remember studying his career<br>
    in school... the treaty of Alpha<br>
    Cygnus Nine, the Coridan admission<br>
    to the Federation, the Klingon<br>
    Alliance...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I met him once... Many years ago,<br>
    just briefly at his son's wedding.<br>
    (smiles at memory)<br>
    But I'll tell you it was quite<br>
    a moment for a young lieutenant.<br>
    Standing in the presence of such<br>
    history... I was a little<br>
    tongue-tied to be quite frank...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You... tongue-tied?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sarek&quot; - REV. 3/15/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Indeed. After all, how does one<br>
    make small talk with a man who<br>
    has virtually shaped the<br>
    Federation...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is it true that he'll be<br>
    retiring after this mission?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Unofficially, that's what I hear.<br>
    And what a crowning achievement<br>
    this will be to his career. The<br>
    benefits of relations with the<br>
    Legarans are incalculable.</p>
  <p> They have arrived at the Transporter Room.</p>
  <p>3 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> There are FOUR CREWMEMBERS forming an honor guard on<br>
    either side of the transporter stage. They stand at<br>
    attention. O'BRIEN is at the console, as KI MENDROSSEN<br>
    (a human -- fifty-five, stocky, comp), and SAKKATH (A<br>
    Vulcan, early twenties) MATERIALIZE on the pads. They<br>
    step off.</p>
  <p> MENDROSSEN<br>
    Ah... Captain Picard. I am Ki<br>
    Mendrossen, the ambassador's chief<br>
    of staff. This is Sakkath, his<br>
    personal assistant.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Has the ambassador been delayed?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sarek&quot; - 3/5/90 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MENDROSSEN<br>
    He will be joining us momentarily.<br>
    But first we must discuss some<br>
    matters of the utmost delicacy.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker exchange a quick look. What's going<br>
    on?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    By all means.</p>
  <p> MENDROSSEN<br>
    To be frank Captain, the<br>
    ambassador is not a young man.<br>
    He tires easily.</p>
  <p> SAKKATH<br>
    He is going to need a great deal<br>
    of rest to prepare himself for<br>
    the difficult job that awaits him.</p>
  <p> MENDROSSEN<br>
    Which is why it's imperative that<br>
    he be allowed to conserve his<br>
    strength. I must request that<br>
    you dispense with any official<br>
    ceremonies you would normally<br>
    accord a visitor of his rank.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We had planned for a ship's<br>
    concert this evening.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, I believe that the ambassador<br>
    is extremely fond of Mozart.</p>
  <p> Mendrossen reluctantly shakes his head.</p>
  <p> MENDROSSEN<br>
    I'm afraid it would be impossible<br>
    for him to attend. Upon his<br>
    arrival he will be taken directly<br>
    to his quarters where he will<br>
    remain in seclusion until we reach<br>
    Legara Four.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You have my assurance that the<br>
    ambassador will not be disturbed<br>
    during our voyage.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sarek&quot; - REV. 3/6/90 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Mendrossen relaxes, an ingratiating smile.</p>
  <p> MENDROSSEN<br>
    That's all we ask. Well, now...<br>
    that's settled. The ambassador<br>
    is waiting.</p>
  <p> Picard nods to O'Brien who works his controls.</p>
  <p>4 TRANSPORTER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> SAREK and his wife, PERRIN (a human) MATERIALIZE.<br>
    Sarek is indeed old, but immensely commanding. A<br>
    genuinely regal figure. Perrin is much younger -- about<br>
    Picard's age -- poised and charming, with an immediate<br>
    warmth about her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Welcome aboard the Enterprise<br>
    Ambassador Sarek.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    We come to serve.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your service honors us.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    Allow me to present she who is<br>
    my wife.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mrs. Sarek.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Please call me Perrin, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is my first officer,<br>
    Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> Riker and Sarek exchange nods.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Captain, if you'd be so kind as<br>
    to show us to our quarters.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    I prefer to view the conference<br>
    room first.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sarek&quot; - REV. 3/6/90 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Mendrossen moves closer to Sarek.</p>
  <p> MENDROSSEN<br>
    Ambassador, I'm sure Sakkath and<br>
    I can handle all the necessary<br>
    details...</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    I will examine it for myself.</p>
  <p> An awkward moment as Mendrossen and Perrin exchange<br>
    a brief glance.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Dear, perhaps it would be best<br>
    if we settled in first.</p>
  <p> Sarek silences her with a look.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    They worry about my health,<br>
    Captain. Too much.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    You will take me to the conference<br>
    room, please.</p>
  <p> And there's no doubt that he means it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If you'll follow me, sir.</p>
  <p> Mendrossen and Sakkath close in behind Sarek as Riker<br>
    leads them out of the Transporter Room. Perrin looks<br>
    back and smiles at Picard in gracious apology.</p>
  <p>5 CLOSE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> Things haven't gone at all the way he expected. He<br>
    doesn't look troubled, exactly -- only wondering...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sarek&quot; - 3/5/90 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>6 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM</p>
  <p> The room is currently dominated by a large bulky tank<br>
    about chest high containing a gaseous/liquid revolting<br>
    mixture. GEORDI, WESLEY, and a few SUPERNUMERARIES<br>
    are busily connecting a complicated series of pipes<br>
    and cables around the tank. There are a few pictures<br>
    on the walls and a generic table with chairs. Wesley<br>
    peers into the tank with disgust.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Are the Legarans really going to<br>
    sit in this stuff?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, I'm sure not.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Can you believe this smell?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What smell?</p>
  <p> Wesley looks up in surprise. Geordi laughs and Wesley<br>
    gives him an abashed grin.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What can I say... to us it's a<br>
    slime pit, to them it's home.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (a little eager)<br>
    The environmental controls are<br>
    ready. What's next?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Why? Are you in some kind of<br>
    hurry?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I have... sort of a date.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    With who?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (shy, but proud)<br>
    Ensign Dumont.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sarek&quot; - 3/5/90 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (whistles)<br>
    That is one attractive lady. I've<br>
    got to admit I'm surprised.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (grinning)<br>
    What, that she'd go out with me?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No, that you had the nerve to ask<br>
    her. Way to go Wesley.</p>
  <p> Sarek, Sakkath, Perrin, Picard and Riker ENTER. Sarek<br>
    walks to the center of the room, looks things over and<br>
    is immediately displeased. Sarek's attitude is<br>
    irritated and he seems to grow more agitated by the<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    The room is not ready.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No Ambassador. Commander La Forge<br>
    and Ensign Crusher are---</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    The Legarans are very sensitive<br>
    in matters of protocol. You will<br>
    remove all furniture from the<br>
    room. The walls must be bare.</p>
  <p> MENDROSSEN<br>
    I'm sure that by the time the<br>
    Legarans arrive, everything will<br>
    be set up according to our<br>
    specifications. Isn't that right,<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ambassador, please be assured that<br>
    everything will be ready by the<br>
    time the conference begins.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    My husband and I have every<br>
    confidence in you, Captain.</p>
  <p> Sarek continues to look over the room.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sarek&quot; - REV. 3/15/90 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    (voice rises slightly)<br>
    I have worked for ninety-three<br>
    years in preparation for this<br>
    meeting. It is vital that no<br>
    detail be overlooked.</p>
  <p> Sakkath moves next to Sarek. As Sakkath looks at<br>
    Sarek, there is a subtle change in Sarek's demeanor.<br>
    He becomes more impassive, less irritated. The<br>
    interaction between Sakkath and Sarek should not be<br>
    immediately obvious.</p>
  <p> SAKKATH<br>
    Perhaps we should allow these<br>
    gentlemen to return to their work,<br>
    Ambassador.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    That will be acceptable.</p>
  <p> Sarek leads the way back out of the room with Sakkath<br>
    and Mendrossen. As he reaches the doorway Sarek pauses<br>
    and looks at the wall.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    These walls are too bright.</p>
  <p> Sarek, Sakkath and Mendrossen EXIT.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sarek&quot; - REV. 3/15/90 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>7 OMITTED</p>
  <p>8 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship goes into warp.</p>
  <p>9 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker (now in standard uniforms) at Command<br>
    along with TROI. WORF at his station.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    So what was the ambassador like?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The way Mendrossen described him,<br>
    I expected him to be a frail old<br>
    man.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hope I'm that frail when I'm<br>
    two hundred and two. His aides<br>
    did seem a little overprotective,<br>
    didn't they?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    From what I could see, the<br>
    ambassador doesn't need to be<br>
    protected from anything.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nevertheless, we will honor Mister<br>
    Mendrossen's request and allow<br>
    Ambassador Sarek his privacy.<br>
    (beat, sighs)<br>
    I suppose they were foolish and<br>
    vain, my expectations of this<br>
    voyage. Sharing his thoughts,<br>
    his memories, his unique<br>
    understanding of the history he<br>
    has made...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Does this mean you're going to<br>
    cancel the concert this evening?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, the concert will go on as<br>
    scheduled. But it is a pity that<br>
    the guest of honor will be absent.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sarek&quot; - REV. 3/15/90 - ACT ONE 9A.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    For all we know, the ambassador<br>
    might enjoy an evening's<br>
    entertainment...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Why not ask his wife if she'd like<br>
    to attend?</p>
  <p> Picard considers this for a beat. He nods.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sarek&quot; - 3/5/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think that's an excellent idea.</p>
  <p> Riker smiles in approval. Picard stands.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The bridge is yours, Number One.</p>
  <p> Picard heads for the turbolift.</p>
  <p>10 INT. GUEST QUARTERS</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES. The blinds over the windows are<br>
    closed. As Perrin moves toward the door, we can see<br>
    that she looks very tired, almost exhausted. She<br>
    presses the control panel and the door slides open,<br>
    revealing Picard.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Come in, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hope I'm not intruding.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Not at all. But I'm afraid that<br>
    Sarek is in meditation at the<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Actually, I came to see you.</p>
  <p> Perrin leads him into the room.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    Why, how nice Captain. I so<br>
    rarely get visitors of my own.<br>
    Usually everyone wants to see the<br>
    ambassador.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I find that hard to believe.</p>
  <p> Perrin smiles at him warmly. She indicates a seat for<br>
    the captain and they both sit down.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sarek&quot; - REV. 3/7/90 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    These quarters are lovely.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The ambassador and I were both<br>
    very pleased when we heard that<br>
    the negotiations would take place<br>
    aboard the flagship of the<br>
    Federation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The honor is ours.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    My husband has followed your<br>
    career with interest. He finds<br>
    it to be satisfactory.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (reacts with pleasure)<br>
    High praise from a Vulcan.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Ah, then you have had experience<br>
    with Vulcans, Captain. Some<br>
    people who expect an emotional<br>
    response often find Vulcans<br>
    quite cold when they are merely<br>
    being...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Logical.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Exactly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have come to extend my personal<br>
    invitation to you... and your<br>
    husband, if he is available, to<br>
    attend a Mozart recital this<br>
    evening.</p>
  <p> And now Perrin's face really brightens in anticipation.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Mozart? That would be wonderful.<br>
    Any chance that they will be<br>
    performing the string quartet<br>
    number six?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure it could be arranged.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sarek&quot; - 3/5/90 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    It's a very tempting offer...<br>
    (looks over at door to<br>
    adjacent room)<br>
    I doubt that the ambassador will<br>
    be able to attend, but I will make<br>
    it a point to ask him.</p>
  <p> Picard stands and Perrin escorts him to the door.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, then I hope to see you<br>
    tonight.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    As do I.</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS.</p>
  <p>11 CLOSE ON PERRIN</p>

    slightly as she moves toward the closed door to the<br>
    adjacent room.</p>
  <p>12 INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Sarek is kneeling on a angled stool (like a computer<br>
    stool). His eyes are wide open, and his expression is<br>
    not calm and distant, but conscious and troubled.</p>
  <p>13 ANGLE ON DOOR</p>
  <p> The door slides aside and Perrin ENTERS. The easy,<br>
    light manner that she showed to Picard is gone. This<br>
    is a deeply worried woman. She goes over to Sarek and<br>
    puts her hand on his shoulder. Sarek looks up at her.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    You are still unable to meditate?</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    It is of no importance.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    It has eluded you for many weeks.</p>
  <p> Sarek gets up, towers over his wife with a vague air of<br>
    threat.</p>

  <p> SAREK<br>
    (low)<br>
    I said, it is of no importance.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    (not backing down)<br>
    You know I am right.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    My wife, you will leave me now.<br>
    I require solitude.</p>
  <p> There is a beat of silence as Perrin considers<br>
    refusing. She thinks better of it, then EXITS. PUSH<br>
    IN on Sarek... and we see a flicker of turmoil within.</p>
  <p>14 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM</p>
  <p> Geordi and Wesley are still working on the tanks. The<br>
    supernumeraries are no longer present. The pictures<br>
    and furnishings seen earlier have been removed.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    The temperature in the tank is<br>
    now one hundred fifty degrees<br>
    Celsius.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay, lock it off.</p>
  <p> Wesley works the control on the tank. He turns back to<br>
    Geordi and his tone of voice suddenly becomes somewhat<br>
    surly.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Is that it? Can I get out of<br>
    here?</p>
  <p> And at first it just seems like kidding around...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What's your hurry? You don't<br>
    really think something's gonna<br>
    happen between you and Suzanne<br>
    Dumont...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    At least I'm not spending the<br>
    night with a good book like some<br>
    people...</p>

  <p> And now slowly it begins to turn into something more...<br>
    with just an edge --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What's that supposed to mean?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Just what it sounds like.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You'd get more action out of a<br>
    good book than you'll ever see<br>
    on this date, I guarantee it...<br>
    she's not going to waste her time<br>
    with someone like you.</p>
  <p> And now this is really getting nasty...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Someone like me?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    She's way out of your league.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Since when did you become an<br>
    expert on women?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Compared to you, every man on this<br>
    ship is an expert on women.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    At least I don't have to find my<br>
    women in the Holodeck!</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (deadly)<br>
    What did you say?</p>

    No, sir. Nothing wrong here.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>

    May I be excused, Commander?</p>
  <p> Riker nods and Wesley EXITS. Riker looks at Geordi and<br>
    his voice is a little less official.</p>

  <p> The ship's concert has not yet begun, but<br>

    a string quartet with DATA prominent among them, is<br>
    tuning up.</p>

  <p> as they ENTER and move to their seats.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I noticed that Lieutenant Worf<br>
    put Ensign D'Amato on report...<br>
    for insubordination.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    D'Amato's been an exemplary<br>
    officer.</p>
  <p> They sit. BEVERLY and TROI are seated nearby.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Indeed he has. Look into it,<br>
    Number One.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I assume work has been progressing<br>
    in the conference room?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir. I checked on Geordi<br>
    and Wesley a few hours ago.<br>
    (beat while he wonders<br>
    whether to mention it)<br>
    For a moment there... I thought<br>
    that the two of them were actually<br>
    going to... hit one another.</p>

  <p> Picard notices something o.s. and stands up.</p>
  <p>19 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> including doorway. Sarek and Perrin have entered.<br>
    Mendrossen is behind them and Sakkath is close by<br>
    Sarek. Everyone in the theater stands.</p>

    are waiting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ambassador Sarek, Perrin... on<br>
    behalf of my entire crew, welcome.</p>
  <p> Picard and Perrin exchange a smile. Sarek notices<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    It was my wife's suggestion that<br>
    we attend... and it seemed an<br>
    ideal diversion. My wife can be<br>
    quite logical when she so chooses.</p>
  <p> Perrin only smiles wider.</p>
  <p> MENDROSSEN<br>
    (jovially)<br>
    It seems the ambassador had more<br>
    free time than I anticipated.</p>
  <p> Picard waves over Data who walks over carrying his<br>
    violin.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is Commander Data. He will<br>
    be the featured soloist this<br>
    evening.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Perrin)<br>
    We will start the evening with<br>
    Mozart's string quartet number<br>
    six. I am programmed to reproduce<br>
    the individual musical styles of<br>
    over three hundred concert<br>
    violinists, including Heifitz,<br>
    Menuhin, Grak-tay and Tataglia.<br>
    Do you have a preference?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sarek&quot; - REV. 3/6/90 - ACT TWO 18.</p>

  <p> Both Perrin and Sarek are impressed. Perrin looks to<br>
    Sarek and he indicates that the choice is hers.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Tataglia would be lovely.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I hope you find the performance<br>
    pleasing.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    I look forward to it.</p>
  <p> Picard indicates their seats and turns to Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    At your convenience, Commander.</p>

  <p> Data walks over to stage, nods to the other musicians<br>
    and begins to play.</p>

  <p> Perrin and Sarek appear to be concentrating on the<br>

    glances at Sarek.</p>
  <p> TIME CUT:</p>
  <p>22 ANGLE ON STAGE</p>
  <p> The musicians are playing a new piece of music. Data<br>
    is giving a perfect performance. This piece must be<br>
    very emotional. (Note: it is the beauty of the<br>
    music which creates the emotional response in the<br>
    audience... a perhaps familiar melody that stirs<br>
    memories.)</p>
  <p>23 ANGLE ON CROWD</p>
  <p> We PAN across the gathered crewmen and we can see that<br>
    they are caught up in the lovely music. END PAN on<br>

  <p> She is listening to the music. She suddenly senses<br>
    something odd and looks around the room in puzzlement.</p>
  <p>23B NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> on Mendrossen and Sakkath. Sakkath has noticed<br>
    Sarek's change of mood and is leaning over to whisper<br>
    something to Mendrossen. They look at Sarek with<br>
    alarm. Mendrossen tries to get Perrin's attention in<br>

  <p> in the foreground, Picard behind him... Picard (or for<br>
    that matter any other member of the crew) cannot see<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Hi Mom. I got a message you<br>
    wanted to see me?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I thought you were going to be<br>
    at the concert last night.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I said I might be going. Suzanne<br>
    wanted to go to the arboretum.</p>
  <p> Wesley is unconcerned at this point. Beverly, however,<br>
    is starting a slow burn.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain Picard asked where you<br>
    were. I don't like having to make<br>
    excuses for you.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Excuses? Come on, Mom... it<br>
    wasn't an official function.</p>
  <p> Wesley picks up some small art object from a table and<br>
    starts to absently toy with it. Beverly grabs it from<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You have responsibilities young<br>
    man and I expect you to live up<br>
    to them!</p>

    Don't talk back to me!</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (hurt)<br>
    Okay, I won't.</p>

  <p> There is a long beat as Beverly realizes what she's<br>

    shocked.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    ... and then I just slapped him.<br>
    Really hard.<br>
    (incredulous)<br>
    I slapped Wesley.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Do you know why you did it?</p>

    Wes?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    That's just it... I wasn't<br>

  <p> Sakkath's frown deepens slightly at this news. He<br>
    seems troubled by something, but his Vulcan reserve<br>

    somebody's left hook is on its<br>
    way to my chin.</p>
  <p> Pulling back to see Picard, Riker, Worf, Troi surveying<br>
    the damage. SEVERAL CREWMEMBERS are clearing away some<br>
    of the debris.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, this is not an isolated<br>
    incident. There have been reports<br>
    of random violence all over the<br>
    ship...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    Are you suggesting it is somehow<br>
    contagious?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There's no indication of a virus<br>
    or bacteria... I've run every test<br>
    I know... I've checked the water,<br>
    the food replicators, airborne<br>
    samples...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is one hell of a time...<br>
    (beat, to Riker)<br>
    Whatever it is, I don't want it<br>
    to affect the ambassador... I<br>
    want his quarters isolated from<br>
    the rest of the crew until we can<br>
    identify the cause.</p>

    It's not that simple, Captain.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We've been able to determine that<br>
    these outbreaks of violence<br>
    started... at virtually the same<br>
    time Sarek's party beamed aboard<br>
    the ship.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts and...</p>

    this turn of events.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We do have a working theory...</p>
  <p> Glancing with import at Troi. A deep breath and...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We believe it's possible that<br>
    Ambassador Sarek himself is<br>
    responsible for these incidents.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sarek?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I felt something from him during<br>
    the concert... it was vague and<br>
    undefined... but very<br>
    disturbing...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (a small realization)<br>
    He cried. I saw that. I didn't<br>
    believe it. A Vulcan moved to<br>
    tears by music... ?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Vulcans have the same basic<br>
    emotions that we do. But they<br>
    have learned to repress them.<br>
    At the concert, I was sensing<br>
    that Sarek had lost control...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What would cause such a loss of<br>
    control?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sarek&quot; - REV. 3/7/90 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>33A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There is a very rare condition<br>
    that sometimes affects Vulcans<br>
    over the age of two hundred.<br>
    Bendii Syndrome.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The early symptoms include sudden<br>
    bursts of emotion, mostly<br>
    irrational anger. Eventually,<br>
    all emotional control is lost.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can't imagine anything that<br>
    would be more offensive to a<br>
    Vulcan. Their emotional<br>
    detachment is the very core of<br>
    their being.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But why would it affect others<br>
    aboard the ship?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Vulcans possess telepathic<br>
    ability. Sarek could be<br>
    unintentionally projecting these<br>
    intense emotions onto other<br>
    people... at random.</p>
  <p> Picard's expression becomes more grim as he realizes<br>
    the broader implications.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And when the Legarans beam<br>
    aboard...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    They could very well be affected<br>
    too.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there a treatment?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (shakes her head, no)<br>
    Can't anyone take his place?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sarek has built a personal<br>
    relationship with them. They will<br>
    accept no one else.<br>

    That's impossible, Captain Picard.<br>
    I cannot delay the conference...<br>
    not for a day, not for an hour.<br>
    The schedule itself required three<br>
    months of negotiations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    facing a potentially far worse...</p>

    health. Is that not enough?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Mendrossen...</p>
  <p> MENDROSSEN<br>
    You are dealing with a theory full<br>
    of holes, Captain. Why am I not<br>
    affected by Sarek's supposed<br>
    condition? And Perrin, how could<br>
    his wife function normally if this<br>
    theory of yours is correct?</p>

    I cannot explain that. Hundreds<br>

    You are accusing the greatest man<br>

    On the eve of his greatest<br>
    triumph. And you cannot explain<br>
    why... ?</p>
  <p> Beat. Stands.</p>
  <p> MENDROSSEN<br>
    I won't report this to the<br>
    ambassador. For the moment. I<br>
    do not want to divert his<br>
    attention from the mission.<br>
    (&quot;friendly&quot;)<br>
    And I don't want to jeopardize<br>
    your career unnecessarily. But<br>
    if I were you, in the interests<br>

    concerned about finding the real<br>

  <p>35 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM</p>
  <p> Sakkath stands near the Legaran tanks. And this is a<br>
    man in turmoil. Logic tells him he cannot allow what<br>
    is occurring to continue. He fears what will happen<br>
    at the conference. Yet, he is dedicated to Sarek.<br>
    These matters weigh on his mind as the doors slide open<br>
    and Data ENTERS. There is a beat of silence as they<br>
    glance at each other.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain Picard is not satisfied<br>
    with Ki Mendrossen's assurances<br>
    that the ambassador is in good<br>
    health. Do you consider Sarek<br>
    capable of carrying out his<br>
    mission?</p>

    to me.</p>
  <p> SAKKATH<br>
    (carefully)<br>
    I do not recall making such a<br>
    statement.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Directly, no. However, you did<br>
    question me on the diplomatic<br>
    capabilities of both Captain<br>
    Picard and Counselor Troi.</p>
  <p> SAKKATH<br>
    I am honor bound to help Sarek<br>
    carry out his mission. That is<br>
    the only answer I can give.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then you must decide which is your<br>
    greater obligation: your loyalty<br>
    to Sarek or your duty to the<br>
    Federation.</p>
  <p> Sakkath remains impassive and Data continues after a<br>
    beat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Can you accept the logic of<br>
    continuing the mission?</p>

    emotional control and thus protect<br>
    others from the effects of his<br>
    deterioration.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He hasn't been doing a very good<br>

    The strain of this mission on<br>

  <p> Picard frowns, stands.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ironic isn't it? Despite our<br>
    magnificent technology, we find<br>
    ourselves still susceptible to<br>
    the ravages of old age. The loss<br>
    of dignity, the slow betrayal of<br>

  <p> He inadvertently winds up saying this to Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Sir, it is conceivable that even<br>

  <p>37A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sarek is a logical, intelligent<br>
    being. The effects of Bendii<br>

    such a man choose to ignore<br>
    them?</p>
  <p> A beat as Picard considers his answer...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Logic fails us sometimes, Data.<br>
    This is one of those times. I<br>
    can only guess that he does not<br>
    see or does not wish to see the<br>
    truth. And he is being insulated<br>
    from that truth by those who love<br>
    him the most.</p>

  <p> Picard is looking for an opening. He will not be so<br>
    easily sidetracked.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    She is... but the fact remains<br>
    that these incidents began shortly<br>
    after your arrival.</p>
  <p> Sarek is starting to get a little irritated despite<br>
    himself.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    Is your entire argument to be<br>
    based on mere coincidence?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is it also coincidence, that your<br>
    wife and chief of staff have been<br>
    carefully isolating you?</p>

  <p>43 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    (with understanding)<br>
    I believe I now see the flaw in<br>
    your logic. You are reacting to<br>
    their overprotective attitudes<br>
    towards me.<br>

  <p> SAREK (Cont'd)<br>
    They are both somewhat emotional<br>
    regarding my... age.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Surely Sakkath is not influenced<br>
    by emotions.</p>
  <p> Sarek cannot keep the annoyance out of his voice any<br>
    longer.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    Am I to be branded by the<br>
    judgment of a child? Sakkath<br>
    is young and inexperienced. He<br>
    erred in his assumption that I<br>
    needed help.</p>
  <p> Picard has decided that the only way to get Sarek to<br>
    admit to his condition is to force him into an<br>
    emotional response. Picard would rather avoid this,<br>
    but he sees that he has no other choice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (starting to press)<br>
    But you did need his help at the<br>
    concert.</p>
  <p> Sarek is a little shocked and doesn't respond. Picard<br>
    presses him harder.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Or perhaps you have a logical<br>
    explanation for what happened<br>
    that night?</p>
  <p> For the first time we see a hesitation in Sarek's<br>
    responses. He is not as sure of himself as the moment<br>
    before.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    What... happened?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I saw you crying.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    I did not... cry.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was there... I saw the tears.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sarek&quot; - REV. 3/7/90 - ACT FOUR 44A.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Sarek answers quickly, as if anxious to prove a point.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    You exaggerate, Captain. I<br>
    recall... only one tear.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sarek&quot; - REV. 3/7/90 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (forceful)<br>
    Then you were emotionally affected<br>
    by the music.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    (edge creeping into<br>
    voice)<br>
    That is not possible.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You still have not answered me,<br>
    Sarek. Is it logical for a Vulcan<br>
    to cry?</p>
  <p> Sarek is cornered and he knows it. He desperately<br>
    searches for an answer.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    It was late... I was fatigued.<br>
    Nothing more.</p>
  <p> Picard simply stares at him, allows the false response<br>
    to hang in the air. Sarek tries to regain control of<br>
    the situation.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    The Legarans trust only me. They<br>
    will not meet with any other<br>
    representative of the Federation.<br>
    I must be allowed to complete my<br>
    mission. There are no other<br>
    logical solutions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (pressing)<br>
    No other logical solutions? But<br>
    Ambassador, there are always other<br>
    solutions. You have said so<br>
    yourself many times.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    What I meant was...<br>
    (pauses)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sarek of Vulcan was never afraid<br>
    to look straight at something he<br>
    did not want to see.</p>
  <p> Sarek is having a hard time remaining impassive.</p>

  <p> SAREK<br>
    I warn you Captain, your efforts<br>
    to discredit me will not succeed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sarek of Vulcan never confused<br>
    what he wanted with the truth.</p>
  <p> Sarek's hands are tightly clenched into fists. His<br>
    voice is now clearly enraged.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    I will not be spoken to in such<br>
    a manner.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is that anger I hear in your<br>
    voice?</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    (struggling to maintain<br>
    control)<br>
    It would be illogical for a Vulcan<br>
    to show anger... it would be<br>
    illogical... illogical...</p>

    In three hours time we are<br>
    scheduled to meet with the Legaran<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>

    contact their ambassador?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (turns)<br>
    No.<br>
    (off Riker's look)<br>
    I will present our regrets to the<br>
    Legarans personally. It is vital<br>
    that they understand our reasons<br>
    for cancelling the negotiations.</p>
  <p> Picard is still haunted by what happened with Sarek.<br>
    Riker can see that the captain is still troubled.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    Captain, with all due respect...<br>
    I think you did the right thing.</p>

  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Resting.<br>

    I've come to ask you to reconsider<br>
    your position.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You know that's impossible.</p>
  <p> But Perrin is not to be denied. She continues to plead<br>
    her case...</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Sarek is a... good man, Captain.<br>
    He has given the Federation a<br>
    lifetime of service. I beg you,<br>
    let him keep the respect he has<br>
    earned.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He will never lose that respect.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    If you need to blame someone,<br>
    blame Mendrossen and me.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But we never wanted to deceive<br>
    you. My husband's... condition...<br>
    came on him so... gradually. It<br>
    was so easy to... delude<br>
    ourselves, to pretend that nothing<br>
    was wrong. We convinced ourselves<br>
    that he could complete this one<br>
    last task... and end his career...<br>
    the way it began... with dignity.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not blaming anyone.</p>
  <p> PERRIN<br>
    Then help him, Captain, please.<br>
    Help him regain his pride...<br>

  <p>51 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard and Sarek are standing near the Legaran tank.<br>
    Sarek is a little surprised.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    A mind-meld... between the two<br>
    of us? Do you realize the dangers<br>
    involved in what you are<br>
    proposing?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Ambassador, I do. But I also<br>
    realize the potential benefits.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    We would be telepathically<br>
    linked... exchanging our<br>
    thoughts... becoming in essence<br>
    one mind.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Which, for a few hours, should<br>
    provide you with the emotional<br>
    control you need. Enough time<br>
    for you to meet with the Legarans<br>
    and conclude the treaty.</p>
  <p> Sarek is tempted... but he hesitates.</p>
  <p> SAREK<br>
    It is a generous offer. But I<br>
    must warn you that while I would<br>
    gain your stability, you would<br>
    experience the fierce onslaught<br>
    of emotions unleashed by my...<br>
    condition. Vulcan emotions are<br>
    extremely intense... we have<br>
    learned to suppress them. No<br>
    human would be able to control<br>
    them. They would overwhelm you...<br>
    the mind-meld can be a terrible<br>
    intimacy.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I cannot allow it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am aware of the risks, Sarek.<br>
    But I believe it is the only...<br>
    logical solution.</p>

    to a certain... trepidation.<br>
