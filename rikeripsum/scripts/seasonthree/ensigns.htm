    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Moving at impulse near some extraordinarily interesting<br>
    astronomical object.</p>
  <p>2 INT. TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> Present are PICARD, BEVERLY, and TWELVE N.D.<br>
    CREWMEMBERS. A VULCAN and ONE WOMAN are seated,<br>
    holding their instruments -- a violin and a viola.<br>
    O'BRIEN tunes his cello. DATA ENTERS carrying a<br>
    violin. He checks at the door, startled to see the<br>
    captain. Picard beckons, and Data crosses to him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, Doctor, I am honored by<br>
    your presence, but may I suggest<br>
    you attend the second concert.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Why, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ensign Ortiz will perform the<br>
    violin part. My rendition will<br>
    be less enjoyable.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    While I am quite proficient<br>
    Technically, according to my<br>
    fellow performers, I lack soul.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Data, telling us why you're going<br>
    to fail before you make the<br>
    attempt is never wise.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But is not honesty always the<br>
    preferred choice?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensigns of Command&quot; - REV. 7/14/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Excessive honesty can be<br>
    disastrous... particularly in a<br>
    commander.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (very intrigued)<br>
    Indeed?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Knowing your limitations is one<br>
    thing. Advertising them to a crew<br>
    can damage your ability to lead.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Because you lose their respect?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No, because you may begin to<br>
    believe in those limitations<br>
    yourself.</p>
  <p> Data considers this, then moves to take his place with<br>
    the other performers.</p>
  <p>2A ANGLE ON PICARD AND BEVERLY</p>
  <p> O.s., the string quartet TUNES. There is the SOUND of<br>
    the communicator hail.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain, we're receiving a message<br>
    from the Sheliak Corporate.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts with surprise, stands and EXITS. As he<br>
    leaves, the quartet starts to PLAY.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>3 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS. RIKER and WORF at their usual stations.<br>
    Supernumeraries at CONN and OPS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensigns of Command&quot; - REV. 7/14/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Origin point of the message<br>
    confirmed. It is from the Shelia<br>
    star system.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Sheliak have not attempted<br>
    to communicate with the Federation<br>
    for a hundred and eleven years.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p>4 ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> What appears is the text of a treaty. English on one<br>
    side, Sheliak on the other. Sheliak is not symbols<br>
    as we know them, but rather a pattern of lights. A<br>
    recorded message begins.</p>
  <p> SHELIAK VOICE<br>
    Federation creatures, there are<br>
    humans on the fifth planet of Tau<br>
    Cygna. This planet was ceded<br>
    to the corporate in section one<br>
    hundred and thirty-three,<br>
    paragraph seventy-seven of the<br>
    Treaty of Armens. We will begin<br>
    settlement of this world in four<br>
    days. Remove the humans.</p>
  <p> Riker is up, and heading for Science One.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What the devil --</p>
  <p> SHELIAK VOICE<br>
    Federation creatures, there are<br>
    humans on the fifth planet --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Cancel message.</p>
  <p> Inquiring look to Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Tau Cygna Five is in the de Laure<br>
    belt -- heavy concentrations of<br>
    hyperonic radiation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensigns of Command&quot; - REV. 7/14/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Humans can't survive in such an<br>
    environment. Exposure to<br>
    hyperonic radiation is fatal.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then the Sheliak are asking us<br>
    to chase ghosts.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, Number One. The Sheliak<br>
    haven't broken a century of<br>
    silence to send us after phantoms.<br>
    An investigation is in order.<br>
    Set course for Tau Cygna Five.</p>
  <p> Off Picard's expression:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF THE TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensigns of Command&quot; REV. 7/19/89 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> entering orbit around a planet.</p>
  <p>6 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Data, Beverly and Worf. Supernumerary<br>
    at CONN.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Human life form readings from the<br>
    planet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So, the Sheliak weren't<br>
    hallucinating.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Numbers?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Impossible to get an accurate<br>
    reading, Captain. The high<br>
    radiation levels are disrupting<br>
    our sensors.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Hyperonic radiation also<br>
    interferes with ship's<br>
    transporters; they are now<br>
    inoperable.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    So are the ship's phasers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How can humans survive down there?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    They must have found a way to<br>
    adapt.<br>
    (thinks it over)<br>
    Milan's work in radiation<br>
    sensitivity suggests it's<br>
    possible. Perhaps with extensive<br>
    virotherapy...<br>
    (grimly)<br>
    Until they found the answer, their<br>
    mortality rate must have been<br>
    staggering.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensigns of Command&quot; - REV. 7/18/79 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, whoever they are and however<br>
    they've survived, we've got to<br>
    get them off the planet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    By treaty, this world does belong<br>
    to the Sheliak...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... who are within their rights<br>
    to demand the removal of these<br>
    &quot;trespassers.&quot;</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And if we don't remove them, the<br>
    Sheliak will.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How forcefully?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    To the Sheliak, humans are a lower<br>
    life form. They'd have no<br>
    compunctions about exterminating<br>
    the intruders.</p>
  <p> Beverly is taken aback. Riker's dead serious.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data. As you are unaffected<br>
    by hyperonic radiation, you will<br>
    go to the planet via shuttlecraft<br>
    and commence evacuation<br>
    procedures.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Without a word wasted the android is out of his chair,<br>
    and EXITS the bridge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any speculation as to what he'll<br>
    find, Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A lost survey ship would be my<br>
    guess. A dozen or so survivors<br>
    at most.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensigns of Command&quot; - REV. 7/17/89 - ACT ONE 6A.</p>
  <p>7 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - SHUTTLE LANDING SITE - DAY</p>
  <p> Data is outside the shuttle, scanning with his<br>
    tricorder.</p>
  <p>7A NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as HARITATH and KENTOR (two male humans) and TWO N.D.<br>
    WORKERS cautiously approach the shuttle from the other<br>
    side (the shuttle blocks their view of Data).</p>
  <p> HARITATH<br>
    (in wonder)<br>
    A shuttlecraft!</p>
  <p> KENTOR<br>
    Where's it from?</p>
  <p> HARITATH<br>
    Look at the markings. I think<br>
    it's from the Federation.</p>
  <p> Data steps into their view from around the shuttle.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Hello.</p>
  <p> The four humans jump, startled.</p>
  <p> HARITATH<br>
    We saw your ship... You're the<br>
    first visitor we've had in...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensigns of Command&quot; - REV. 7/14/89 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>7A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> KENTOR<br>
    The first visitor we've ever had.</p>
  <p> They take a closer look at Data.</p>
  <p> HARITATH<br>
    You're -- not human.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct. I am an android.<br>
    I am Lieutenant Commander Data<br>
    of the Federation Starship<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> HARITATH<br>
    (excited)<br>
    Our great-grandparents were<br>
    citizens of the Federation.<br>
    (realizing)<br>
    But you don't want to waste time<br>
    talking to us...</p>
  <p> KENTOR<br>
    You'll want to speak with<br>
    Gosheven. We'll take you to him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Excellent.</p>
  <p> HARITATH<br>
    I'm sure the Federation will be<br>
    very proud of us. Wait until you<br>
    see all we've accomplished.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And who, precisely, is &quot;we?&quot;</p>
  <p> HARITATH<br>
    You don't know? No, I guess you<br>
    wouldn't, would you? We are the<br>
    descendants of the original<br>
    settlers -- from the colony ship<br>
    Artemis.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>8 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard and Worf in their usual places. Riker at<br>
    Science One. Supernumeraries at Conn and Ops.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensigns of Command&quot; REV. 7/19/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Got it. The Artemis, launched one<br>
    hundred forty-two years ago,<br>
    destination Septimis Minor. When<br>
    they failed to check in, Starfleet<br>
    began an extensive search.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What carried the Artemis so far<br>
    off course?</p>
  <p>9 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - SHUTTLE LANDING SITE - DAY</p>
  <p> Haritath and Kentor wait patiently for Data to finish<br>
    him communication.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My local informant does not know.<br>
    In the early days survival on Tau<br>
    Cygna Five was more important than<br>
    history.</p>
  <p>10 INTERCUTS</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Understood. How many are there?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Approximately fifteen thousand.</p>
  <p> Reactions from the bridge crew. Now they really have<br>
    got a problem.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    We've only got three days.<br>
    Without working transporters, we<br>
    couldn't have them out in time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Shuttles?</p>
  <p> Worf does some figuring on his console.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Loading all the Enterprise<br>
    shuttlecraft to capacity --<br>
    evacuation would take four weeks,<br>
    four days.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensigns of Command&quot; REV. 7/24/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then we need more time. Mister<br>
    Data, prepare the colonists for<br>
    an evacuation.</p>
  <p> DATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard closes the com line.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Mister Worf, get me the Sheliak.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Their home world is quite distant,<br>
    Captain. This will take some<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>11 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - MAIN STREET - DAY</p>
  <p> The main pumping station of Tau Cygna V. In the<br>
    distance are mountains. A thin white line descends<br>
    from the mountains, and as it comes closer we realize<br>
    it is an aqueduct. Along the line of the aqueduct are<br>
    lush fields, a veritable Garden of Eden, which ends<br>
    like a knife-cut and the desert returns. It culminates<br>
    in a strange cubistic-shaped purifying station. In a<br>
    pool, the water churns into a white froth.</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN, the leader, supervises TWO WORKERS testing<br>
    the water in the pool.</p>
  <p> Data, Haritath, and Kentor approach.</p>
  <p> HARITATH<br>
    Gosheven, look what's come --</p>
  <p> Gosheven sees Data, looks him up and down very<br>
    carefully. Gosheven's as surprised as Haritath was,<br>
    but keeps a lid on it -- Data may represent a threat,<br>
    so Gosheven's attempting a poker face.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Lieutenant Commander Data of the<br>
    Starship Enterprise.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensigns of Command&quot; REV. 7/20/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KENTOR<br>
    He's an android.</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    So he is.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Well, you're here -- what do you<br>
    want?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My mission is to prepare this<br>
    colony for evacuation.</p>
  <p> Reactions from the men. Gosheven is calm, almost<br>
    amused:</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Because this planet belongs to<br>
    the Sheliak.</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    And just who is this Sheliak?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The term is plural. The Sheliak<br>
    are an intelligent, non-humanoid<br>
    life form, classification R-3 --</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    This colony's been here for a<br>
    hundred and forty years -- and<br>
    no one's ever seen a Sheliak.<br>
    I'd say that makes Tau Cygna<br>
    Five our planet. (ALTERNATE:<br>
    ninety years)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But the original destination of<br>
    the Artemis was Septimis Minor.</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    The guidance systems on the<br>
    Artemis failed -- and sent them<br>
    off course. Far off course.<br>
    Our ancestors were lucky to find<br>
    any place to land.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensigns of Command&quot; REV. 7/24/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> HARITATH<br>
    And when they did, the radiation<br>
    started killing them.</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    Hyperonic radiation took the lives<br>
    of a third of the colonists before<br>
    they learned they could adapt<br>
    to it.</p>

    Your accomplishments are indeed<br>
    remarkable. However, the<br>

    have a treaty that clearly makes<br>
    this planet Sheliak domain.</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    Then change the treaty.</p>

    That may not be possible. The<br>

    staying and fighting the Sheliak.</p>

    Only eight were willing to<br>

    (cutting him)<br>
    Data, I can't help you -- I don't<br>
    know these people; I haven't<br>
    talked to them. You have. Use<br>
    that fancy positronic brain of<br>
    yours -- and carry out your<br>
    mission.</p>
  <p> Ard'rian walks up to join the android, politely keeps<br>
    a few paces away to let him complete his &quot;phone call&quot;<br>
    with privacy.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If I do not succeed, how violent<br>
    is the Sheliak reaction likely<br>
    to be?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The treaty is the only thing which<br>
    kept them from eradicating the<br>
    colony the moment they discovered<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ah.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    &quot;Ah&quot; is right. The lives of<br>
    fifteen thousand people are riding<br>
    on you. You'd better get<br>
    innovative. Riker out.</p>
  <p> Data gazes into space, thinking. Ard'rian steps up.<br>
    Her mood is upbeat.</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    Data -- we're having an effect.<br>
    So many people are asking<br>
    questions about the Sheliak that<br>
    Gosheven's called a public<br>
    meeting.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensigns of Command&quot; REV. 7/20/89 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Is there any indication that<br>
    Gosheven has changed his position?</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    No. But a meeting will give you<br>
    the chance to present your<br>
    recommendations.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    First, will Gosheven allow me to<br>
    speak? Second, even if he does,<br>
    what good will it do? So far,<br>
    my attempts at persuasion have<br>
    been ineffective.</p>
  <p> Ard'rian looks at him with compassion for a beat --<br>
    then suddenly gives Data a quick kiss on the lips.</p>
  <p> DATA (cont'd)<br>
    Why did you do that?</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    You appeared to need it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Among humans, a kiss normally<br>
    serves to seal a friendship or<br>
    to indicate support, attraction,<br>
    affection.</p>
  <p> Ard'rian nods.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensigns of Command&quot; REV. 7/20/89 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> DATA (cont'd)<br>
    In this context, I would assume<br>
    your intention was to express<br>
    support.</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    That was my primary motivation.</p>
  <p> The implication being that there were secondary<br>
    motivations. But if Data is aware of the implication,<br>
    he makes no sign.</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN (cont'd)<br>
    You don't really understand human<br>
    behavior, do you?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is something of an<br>
    understatement.</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    (sighs)<br>
    Sometimes I don't either.<br>
    androids are a lot more rational.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thus far, that quality has not<br>
    helped me accomplish my mission.</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    A rational argument isn't always<br>
    enough. Maybe to be more<br>
    persuasive, you need to use a<br>
    little reverse psychology.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (accessing)<br>
    Elicit a desired behavior by<br>
    advocating its opposite?<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    That implies deception, does it<br>
    not?</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    A little. But if it helps us<br>
    get our point across...</p>

    Perhaps this is a situation in<br>

  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>26 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Travelling at warp speed.</p>
  <p>27 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> As before, except there are more high tech tools and<br>
    equipment lying about. Geordi is lifting yet another<br>
    trashed test object off the platform. He holds it<br>
    mutely out to Wesley and O'Brien who stare dully at<br>
    this latest failure. There are now four intact<br>
    objects and three blasted ones. Picard ENTERS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (you will get it done)<br>
    How are we progressing, Mister<br>
    La Forge?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (it's impossible)<br>
    About like you'd expect.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (get it done)<br>
    Splendid.</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (wearily)<br>
    He wants the impossible.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (with a grin)<br>
    That's the short definition for<br>
    &quot;captain.&quot;</p>
  <p> Geordi and O'Brien have already returned to work. Wes<br>
    looks at them bemused, then shrugs and pitches in.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>28 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - MAIN STREET - DAY</p>
  <p> A large horseshoe-shaped amphitheater with a place for<br>
    the engineers and Gosheven. A number of citizens --<br>
    including Haritath and Kentor -- have turned out for<br>
    the debate so the place is filled. In the b.g. is the<br>
    aqueduct purifying plant.</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    You've all heard about the android<br>
    Starfleet sent here, and you've<br>
    been discussing why he's come.</p>
  <p> Data and Ard'rian ENTER. Gosheven ignores them.</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN (cont'd)<br>
    I called this meeting to replace<br>
    misinformation with cold, hard<br>
    fact.</p>
  <p> The colonists are craning their necks to look at Data.<br>
    Gosheven realizes Data's presence can't be ignored. He<br>
    strides over to confront Data.</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    Leave. Immediately.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I wish to speak.</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (loud, for the crowd's<br>
    benefit)<br>
    You deny me the opportunity to<br>
    address the assemblage?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensigns of Command&quot; REV. 7/20/89 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    This meeting is not for outsiders.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Do you consider your position so<br>
    weak that it cannot withstand<br>
    debate?</p>
  <p> HARITATH<br>
    Let him talk.</p>
  <p> MURMURS of assent from the crowd. Gosheven gives a<br>
    terse nod. In a sense Data's called him a coward and<br>
    he has to stand up to this city slicker, this outsider.</p>
  <p> Data steps front and center. In an effort to pull this<br>
    off, he attempts to use human rhetorical devices<br>
    (timing, dynamics, inflection, gestures, etc.) -- but,<br>
    as there's no real passion behind them, they come off<br>
    as studied and not quite sincere. A good performance,<br>
    but still a performance.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You know of the Sheliak threat.<br>
    Starfleet wishes to evacuate you<br>
    for your own protection.<br>
    Gosheven has decided otherwise.<br>
    That is his right. And I will<br>
    not waste time trying to reverse<br>
    that decision.</p>
  <p> Surprised reactions from the crowd. This is not what<br>
    they expected to hear.</p>
  <p> DATA (cont'd)<br>
    I admire your conviction in the<br>
    face of certain defeat. Your<br>
    effort will be valiant, though<br>
    doomed. Still, when you die,<br>
    you will die for land and honor.</p>
  <p>29 ANGLE ON</p>
  <p> The crowd. Data's starting to get a reaction. People<br>
    are beginning to eye each other nervously. It's one<br>
    thing to thumb your nose at a distant enemy, quite<br>
    another to talk about dying.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensigns of Command&quot; REV. 7/20/89 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>30 ANGLE ON DATA</p>
  <p> As he reaches down, and takes a YOUNG BOY (twelve or<br>
    so) by the arm, and pulls the child up next to him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Your children will understand that<br>
    they are dying for a worthy cause.</p>
  <p> Big crowd reaction here. Murmurs from various people.<br>
    Mothers pull their children closer to them. Data<br>
    steals a glance at Ard'rian -- &quot;how am I doing?&quot;<br>
    Ard'rian nods encouragingly back -- &quot;fine.&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Long after the battle is over,<br>
    their courage will be remembered<br>
    and extolled.</p>
  <p> Ard'rian jumps in to support him.</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    Remembered by who?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (as if he hadn't<br>
    considered that)<br>
    Ah, that is true. There will be<br>
    no one left alive to remember.</p>
  <p>31 ANGLE ON GOSHEVEN</p>
  <p> as he begins to applaud slowly.</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    A valiant try, android, but what<br>
    a low opinion you must have of<br>
    us.</p>
  <p> The boy's MOTHER snatches her son back from Data, and<br>
    pulls him down in her lap.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I was simply attempting to<br>
    describe your inevitable<br>
    destruction in a manner that<br>
    would have an emotional effect.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensigns of Command&quot; REV. 7/20/89 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> HARITATH<br>
    (standing)<br>
    And he did it pretty damned well.</p>
  <p> MURMURS of agreement from the crowd.</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    Are you ready to follow this<br>
    machine, Haritath? Give up<br>
    everything? Without a fight?<br>
    He says we're going to lose, I<br>
    think that's his own cowardice<br>
    talking!</p>
  <p> Kentor stands. He has a calm but commanding presence.</p>
  <p> KENTOR<br>
    And what if he's right, and you're<br>
    wrong? Shouldn't we consider that<br>
    possibility?</p>
  <p> More crowd reaction. Sympathy is swinging away from<br>
    Gosheven.</p>
  <p> HARITATH<br>
    We may be sacrificing ourselves<br>
    for nothing --</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    Last winter we buried your little<br>
    girl -- laid her to rest next to<br>
    your mother, and you dare speak<br>
    of sacrifice?</p>
  <p> Gosheven whirls and nails Kentor with a look.</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And you, Kentor, we built you<br>
    a new house after the fire wiped<br>
    you out. Can you simply walk away<br>
    from that?</p>
  <p> KENTOR<br>
    Better to walk away than to be<br>
    annihilated.</p>

  <p>31 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    (addressing them all)<br>
    This colony exists because<br>
    generations gave their lives for<br>
    it. Many people died before we<br>
    found a way to adapt to the<br>
    radiation. Many more died<br>
    bringing water to the desert.<br>
    My father --</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    -- is buried on that mountain.<br>
    Well, who's going to be left to<br>
    bury you?</p>
  <p> A vote of confidence is about to take place, and<br>
    Gosheven realizes he's about to lose it. He falls back<br>
    on the innate authority of an elected leader.</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    Have you considered what this<br>
    evacuation means? Everything we<br>
    have, we abandon. Everything<br>
    we've built turns into dust.<br>
    Everything we've accomplished<br>
    means nothing.<br>
    (shakes head)<br>
    Well, I say NO! You elected me<br>
    to be your leader -- follow me<br>
    now! I don't think our chances<br>
    are as hopeless as he says. And<br>
    I'm willing to stake our lives<br>
    on it. Any objections?</p>
  <p> He rakes the crowd with a look. Some mutterings, but<br>
    nobody's quite ready to lead the revolution.</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Good, because here... we...<br>
    stand.</p>
  <p> A few people step up to pound Gosheven on the back, but<br>
    most of the crowd remains huddled, glancing from Data<br>
    to Gosheven and back again. Haritath and Kentor step<br>
    away to talk in private.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>33 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Wesley, Geordi and O'Brien. There are now three<br>
    intact test object and four trashed ones. These are<br>
    three exhausted people. They've been working round<br>
    the clock.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Maybe if we bypassed the autosequence<br>
    and decompiled the<br>
    pattern buffer... ?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    It's no crazier than anything<br>
    else we've tried.</p>
  <p> Wesley drops down by the panel, and begins to tinker<br>
    while Geordi places the last test object on the<br>
    platform. Suddenly the transporter console blows a<br>
    fuse. Electricity races across the panel, and the<br>
    console goes dark. O'Brien is not a happy man. Wesley<br>
    slowly stands up. O'Brien struggles with himself, but<br>
    can't master it.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Ensign Crusher.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    If you ever touch my transporter<br>
    again... I'll kill you.</p>

    Sorry, sir.</p>

    that... well, Gosheven doesn't<br>
    speak for all of us.</p>
  <p> Ard'rian looks at Data hopefully -- maybe the early<br>
    returns aren't so bad after all.</p>
  <p> HARITATH (cont'd)<br>

    needlessly.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And you, Kentor?</p>
  <p> KENTOR<br>
    I'm not sure. Gosheven has done<br>
    well for us. But I'd like to hear<br>
    more of what you have to say.</p>
  <p> HARITATH<br>
    There are many others that feel<br>
    the same way but are uneasy about<br>
    confronting Gosheven.</p>

    Point taken.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    During your talks you must be<br>
    extremely accurate. The treaty<br>
    is 500,000 words. The length was<br>
    to accommodate the Sheliak. They<br>
    consider our language irrational,<br>
    and demanded this level of<br>

  <p> KENTOR<br>
    ... and once the Federation<br>

    alone?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If you so desire.</p>
  <p> HARITATH<br>
    We do. We like doing things on<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    The Federation will offer as<br>
    little or as much help as you<br>
    dictate.</p>

  <p> Nods all around; they are impressed. Data is the<br>
    perfect no-pressure salesman; he simply presents the<br>
    facts. Ard'rian looks expectantly to Kentor;<br>
    Kentor's still uncertain.</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    Kentor -- are you with us?</p>
  <p> Kentor makes up his mind:</p>
  <p> KENTOR<br>
    Yes.<br>

    The question is, how do we<br>

  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    The people respect you, too.<br>
    If you take a stand, they'll<br>
    fall in line.</p>
  <p> KENTOR<br>

    I'm disappointed. I thought we<br>
    had settled this.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Apparently, that is not correct.</p>
  <p> Gosheven steps up to Data.</p>

    It's over. Don't you get it?<br>
    You had your say, and you lost.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I appear to be reversing that<br>

  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    No, you're not -- you're just<br>
    stubborn.<br>
    (getting closer)<br>
    Well, let me tell you something...</p>
  <p> Gosheven touches Data with an electronic prod -- BLUE<br>

  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    Damn you, Gosheven --</p>

  <p> HARITATH<br>
    You killed him?</p>
  <p> GOSHEVEN<br>
    I've killed no one.<br>
    (to Ard'rian)<br>
    I've merely shut down a machine.</p>
  <p> Ard'rian looks daggers at Gosheven, who turns his<br>

  <p> GOSHEVEN (cont'd)<br>
    That's it, everyone. Time to<br>

  <p> Picard and Troi MATERIALIZE. What surrounds them bears<br>
    little resemblance to a ship. Darkness hangs like bats<br>
    in the corners. What little light there is filters<br>
    through swirling mist. As they look down the effect is<br>
    as if they are walking on black ice, and tiny lights,<br>
    like flickering eyes twinkle beneath the floor's<br>
    surface.</p>
  <p> SHELIAK<br>
    Advance and speak.</p>
  <p> Troi and Picard exchange glances for they can see no<br>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>42A INT. ARD'RIAN'S LIVING ROOM</p>
  <p> Ard'rian worriedly inspects the unmoving Data with an<br>
    electronic scanner. Data twitches, &quot;reboots,&quot; comes<br>
    back to life, and sits up. Ard'rian SIGHS, relieved.</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    I was afraid your neural pathways<br>
    were scrambled beyond repair.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am equipped with diagnostic<br>
    circuits and can correct many<br>
    malfunctions.</p>
  <p> Data moves his head, arms, and legs, testing his<br>
    responses.</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    I'm not surprised at Gosheven's<br>
    behavior. But Kentor and the<br>
    others... they said they were<br>
    on our side.<br>
    (bitter)<br>
    I guess words don't mean very<br>
    much.</p>
  <p> Data mulls this over carefully.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps that has been part of our<br>
    difficulty. Words are all we have<br>
    been using.<br>

    Humans seem to take much stronger<br>
    notice of actions.</p>
  <p> Data makes a decision, gets to his feet.</p>
  <p> DATA (cont'd)<br>
    I require a phaser.</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    What's a phaser?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A type of weapon. Unfortunately<br>
    it will not function in the<br>

    forearm is opened, revealing his arm's inner workings;<br>
    Data is &quot;cannibalizing&quot; his arm for parts to modify the<br>
    phaser. Ard'rian looks on in fascination.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Hyperonic radiation randomizes<br>
    phaser beams. But I believe I<br>
    can improvise a servocircuit which<br>
    will compensate by continuously<br>
    recollimating the output.</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    You're using your own neural<br>
    subprocessors to build a smarter<br>
    phaser.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

  <p> Ard'rian's impressed. Data completes his work.</p>

    A shower of SPARKS. EFFECT as the reaction races up<br>
    the aqueduct. The water stops flowing. Gosheven is<br>
    speechless. Data addresses the colonists:</p>
  <p> DATA (cont'd)<br>
    I could reduce this pumping<br>
    station to a pile of debris...<br>
    but I trust my point is clear.<br>
    I am one android with a single<br>
    weapon. There are hundreds of<br>
    Sheliak on the way... and their<br>
    weapons are far more powerful.</p>
  <p> Data pauses. The colonists are dead silent.</p>

  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    No. Of course you don't.</p>
  <p> Data studies her. She's downcast. Mimicking her<br>
    behavior earlier, he gives her a quick kiss on the<br>
    lips, startling her.</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN (cont'd)<br>
    What was that for?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You appeared to require it.</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    You observed I was unhappy and<br>
    did what you concluded would make<br>
    me feel better. A purely rational<br>
    deduction.</p>
  <p> She's still downcast.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Have I disappointed you?</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    No, I'm disappointed in myself<br>
    -- for wanting something I know<br>
    I can't have.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Data, in so many ways you're<br>
    superior to humans. But you are<br>
    still a machine... without<br>
    emotion.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensigns of Command&quot; REV. 7/14/89 - ACT FIVE 57A.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    It's so easy to believe otherwise.<br>
    It's so easy to read things into<br>
    your behavior... and perceive<br>
    feelings where none exist.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Well, I am human and I do have<br>
    feelings... silly though they may<br>
    be at times. I like you, Data.<br>
    You're my favorite android.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But I am the only android you have<br>
    ever met.</p>
  <p> ARD'RIAN<br>
    Rational to the last.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensigns of Command&quot; REV. 7/17/89 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> And with a smile, Ard'rian EXITS. Data climbs into<br>
    the shuttle, and the door closes.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>54 OMITTED</p>
  <p>55 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard is listening to a recording of Data's string<br>
    quartet concert in Ten Forward. DOOR CHIME.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Data ENTERS.</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    Welcome home, Mister Data. Well<br>
    done.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The good doctor was kind enough<br>
    to provide me with a recording<br>
    of your concert. Your<br>
    performance shows a good deal<br>
    of feeling.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    As I have lately had to remind<br>
    others, I have no feelings.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's hard to believe; your<br>
    playing is quite beautiful.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Strictly speaking, it is not<br>
    &quot;my&quot; playing. It is a precise<br>
    imitation of the techniques of<br>
    Jascha Heifetz and Trenka Bron-Ken.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensigns of Command&quot; REV. 7/17/89 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>55 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And is there nothing of Data in<br>
    what I'm hearing?</p>
  <p> Data ponders this.</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    You chose the violinists.<br>
    Heifetz and Bron-Ken had<br>
    radically different styles, but<br>
    you combined them -- successfully.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I suppose I have learned to be<br>
    innovative... when necessary, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard nods. He's made his point.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data... I look forward to<br>
    your next concert.</p>
  <p> On Data's thoughtful expression, we:</p>
