    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. TEN FORWARD/HOLODECK (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Lieutenant ENDICOTT REGINALD BARCLAY THE THIRD slouches<br>
    at the bar. Scattered around the room are HOLO-TROI,<br>
    who sits provocatively at a table in her off the<br>
    shoulder dress; HOLO-RIKER seated at the end of the bar<br>
    and mumbling into his drink, OTHERS. There should be<br>
    the suggestion of something bogus about the scene, like<br>
    a bad John Wayne movie, rife with cliches and<br>
    over-acting. Holo-Guinan walks over to Barclay...<br>
    with a bottle of whisky and a shot glass.</p>
  <p> HOLO-GUINAN<br>
    I don't want any trouble,<br>
    Barlcay...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Trouble? Why would there be<br>
    trouble?</p>
  <p> HOLO-GUINAN<br>
    There's always trouble when you<br>
    come in here.</p>
  <p> Barclay just grins. As he opens the bottle and pours<br>
    a shot... HOLO-GEORDI ENTERS, comes up behind Barclay.</p>
  <p> HOLO-GEORDI<br>
    You're on duty, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Is that a fact?</p>
  <p> HOLO-GEORDI<br>
    It is, and you'll observe it.<br>
    Get back to your post.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Look, pal. Do me a favor. Take<br>
    yourself and your holier-than-thou<br>
    attitude and get out of my life.</p>
  <p> During the above, Holo-Riker looks up from his position<br>
    at the bar, stands, moves over.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot; - REV. 2/14/90 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> HOLO-RIKER<br>
    This is insubordination, Mister<br>
    Barclay.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    So punish me.</p>
  <p> HOLO-RIKER<br>
    (keys insignia)<br>
    Security to Ten-Forward!</p>
  <p> A SECURITY CREWMAN ENTERS and heads for Barclay. In<br>
    a blur of a movement, Barclay manages to flip him<br>
    neatly onto the floor. All stare at him, stunned.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot; - REV. 2/13/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The Holo-Guard groans, Barclay smirks, takes a gulp of<br>
    synthehol and gestures with the glass at Holo-Riker.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    &quot;Insubordination.&quot;</p>
  <p> Holo-Riker seizes his arm and slops the drink; Barclay<br>
    turns quickly, gets a half-Nelson on Holo-Riker and<br>
    strains him painfully against the counter.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Riker, you're nothing but a pretty<br>
    mannequin dressed up in a fancy<br>
    uniform. You're full of hot air,<br>
    and if Picard has a problem with<br>
    me, he can come and tell me<br>
    himself...</p>
  <p> Barclay gives him one last hard push before releasing<br>
    him. Defeated, Holo-Riker slips wearily down and leans<br>
    against the bar. Barclay moves threateningly at<br>
    Holo-Geordi, who retreats, runs out of the room, scared<br>
    to death. Barclay saunters over to the table where<br>
    Holo-Troi is seated. He picks up her willing hand.</p>
  <p> HOLO-TROI<br>
    I feel your confidence, your<br>
    arrogant resolve. It excites me.</p>
  <p> COM VOICE OF THE REAL GEORDI --</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Lieutenant Barclay, report to<br>
    Cargo Bay Five now.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    This will have to wait, darling.<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Um... Be right there.<br>
    (to the room)<br>
    Freeze program. Exit.</p>
  <p> All the human figures FREEZE. Barclay heads toward<br>
    the o.s. Holodeck doors.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Save program.</p>
  <p> Ten Forward vanishes... he EXITS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot; - REV. 2/13/90 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Barclay steps into the corridor, a much altered man.<br>
    The hero of the hour has been replaced with a shy<br>
    individual with a perpetual frown born of stress and<br>
    unhappiness between his brows. He is hustling because<br>
    he's late. Troi comes briskly around a corner. She's<br>
    headed straight for him. He steps aside for her. Troi<br>
    nods in greeting, gives him a kindly but perfunctory<br>
    smile and moves on. We barely notice Barclay sigh as<br>
    he moves on.</p>
  <p>3 INT. CARGO BAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN is operating the transporter console... several<br>
    canisters MATERIALIZE. A couple of ENGINEERING<br>
    TECHNICIANS (named DUFFY and COSTA) move the canisters<br>
    from the transporter pad to an antigrav unit. Geordi<br>
    is studying an open panel on the unit which is out of<br>
    service... Riker is listening to him gripe about<br>
    Barclay.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I just don't know what to do with<br>
    him. He's always late, never<br>
    gives his best effort, always<br>
    slides by... I can't deal with<br>
    it anymore. How does a guy like<br>
    him ever make it through the<br>
    Academy...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (agrees)<br>
    I think it's time we talked to<br>
    the captain about Broccoli.<br>
    (off Geordi's look)<br>
    That's what Wesley calls him.<br>
    Keep it to yourself.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It fits.</p>
  <p>3A ANGLE</p>
  <p> as they see Barclay ENTER... moving to him... a<br>
    throw-away piece of business -- Duffy discovers a<br>
    canister with a trace of GASEOUS NITROGEN leaking from<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> DUFFY<br>
    A broken seal, Commander.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot; - REV. 2/14/90 - TEASER 3A.</p>
  <p>3A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You better destroy it. Those<br>
    samples will be tainted.</p>
  <p> Duffy and the other supernumerary take the canister<br>
    away. Barclay tries to slither past Riker and Geordi.<br>
    What we notice most about him is that he is<br>
    uncomfortable around other people to the point of<br>
    agony... he rarely makes eye contact... when he<br>
    speaks, he hesitates, desperately afraid of saying the<br>
    wrong thing... which he occasionally does.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Is it a problem for you to report<br>
    to duty on time, Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot; - REV. 2/19/90 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Problem? Nossir. I'm... I'm very<br>
    sorry, sir... it's just... I had<br>
    a very important communique...<br>
    it required my immediate response<br>
    and...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (tired of excuses)<br>
    I don't want to hear it... we're<br>
    having intermittent problems with<br>
    the anti-grav unit, see what you<br>
    can do...</p>
  <p> Barclay acknowledges and as he moves to the unit...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Barclay, I'm tired of<br>
    seeing your name on report.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    I don't know what you got away<br>
    with on your last posting, but<br>
    this is the Enterprise. We set<br>
    a different standard here.<br>
    Understood?</p>
  <p> And for a beat, Barclay looks at Riker and it is quite<br>
    a different moment than the Holodeck.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Understood... sir.</p>
  <p> Riker exchanges a glance with Geordi then EXITS as<br>
    Barclay meekly goes to work...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>4 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> In orbit around a PLANET.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43807.4.<br>
    We are taking on a load of special<br>
    tissue samples donated by the<br>
    Mikulaks for shipment to Nahmi<br>
    Four. The samples could prove<br>
    vital to the containment of an<br>
    outbreak of Correllium Fever on<br>
    that world.</p>
  <p>5 INT. CARGO BAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Barclay closes up the anti-grav panels, looks up at<br>
    Geordi...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    Everything looks... it looks<br>
    normal to me...</p>
  <p> He turns it on and the antigrav unit comes to life...<br>
    rises a few feet off the floor. Duffy starts to move<br>
    the unit toward the other end of the cargo bay. Almost<br>
    immediately, the antigrav field fails and there is a<br>
    CRASH as the pallet falls.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Dammit..</p>
  <p> Barclay reacts, Geordi turns, looks at him<br>
    impatiently...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I... I don't understand...</p>
  <p> Barclay looks guilty, tongue-tied... rushes back to<br>
    the anti-grav unit to check it out again.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot; - REV. 2/16/90 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>5A ANGLE</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to com)<br>
    La Forge to Engineering... I'll<br>
    need more people in Cargo Bay<br>
    Five... anyone you can spare.<br>
    Out.</p>
  <p> He moves to the anti-grav unit, begins to lift a<br>
    canister... Geordi looks at Barclay who is still<br>
    trying to solve the mystery in the anti-grav unit<br>
    panel...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We could use a hand, Mister<br>
    Barclay...</p>
  <p> Barclay looks up awkwardly at Geordi... moves quickly<br>
    to help... and as he takes hold of the canister,<br>
    facing Geordi...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I'll... I'll disassemble it later,<br>
    Commander... it shouldn't do<br>
    that... well, of course, it<br>
    shouldn't do that... I mean...<br>
    well, it shouldn't do that.</p>
  <p> Two beats as they carry the canister in silence across<br>
    the room... Barclay avoids Geordi's glare.</p>
  <p>6 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard behind his desk. Riker and Geordi. There is<br>
    a report on the computer screen on Picard's desk.<br>
    Picard indicates the screen.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot; - REV. 2/14/90 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not accustomed to seeing an<br>
    unsatisfactory rating for one of<br>
    my crew.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I guess the issue is whether<br>
    Mister Barclay is Enterprise<br>
    material.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    I assume from your request for<br>
    his transfer that you don't think<br>
    he is, Commander...</p>
  <p> Geordi takes a beat -- he's aware of the impact of this<br>
    answer...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I hate to say it... I always<br>
    thought I could work with<br>
    anyone... but I just can't stand<br>
    the guy. Broccoli makes me<br>
    nervous... he makes everyone<br>
    nervous...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Broccoli?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Young Mister Crusher started it.<br>
    I'm afraid it's caught on.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's get it uncaught, shall we?</p>
  <p> They acknowledge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    By all indications, Barclay has<br>
    served honorably in Starfleet for<br>
    many years. His rating aboard<br>
    the Zhukov was satisfactory...<br>
    I recall Captain Gleason speaking<br>
    quite highly of him before his<br>
    transfer...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    In retrospect, I wonder if Captain<br>
    Gleason wasn't buttering our bread<br>
    a little...<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot; - REV. 2/13/90 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER (Cont'd)<br>
    He knew we were looking for a<br>
    diagnostic engineer.</p>
  <p> Picard glances at him. A beat. Frowns.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've reviewed Barclay's<br>
    psychological profile. He's<br>
    always had seclusive tendencies...<br>
    it was noted at the Academy more<br>
    than once...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And yet he chose this way of life;<br>
    he's made the same commitment to<br>
    Starfleet that we all have...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It's easy to transfer our problem<br>
    to someone else. Too easy.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, it's not like I haven't<br>
    tried...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Try harder.</p>
  <p> The captain studies La Forge... there is an issue of<br>
    command to be examined here...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He's on your team. Manage him.<br>
    Pull him in. Find ways to help<br>
    him make a positive contribution.<br>
    Get to know the man. Make him<br>
    your best friend.</p>
  <p> Geordi smiles with a bit of incredulity...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    With all respect, sir... my best<br>
    friend? I can barely tolerate<br>
    being in the same room with the<br>
    man...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I suggest you put your personal<br>
    discomfort with him aside,<br>
    Commander. Dismissed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot; - REV. 2/14/90 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Geordi exchanges a depressed glance at Riker and they<br>
    EXIT...</p>
  <p>6A INT. CARGO BAY</p>
  <p> Geordi ENTERS... the room is deserted now except for<br>
    Barclay who is off to one side looking over the<br>
    disassembled antigrav unit. It's open, the guts<br>
    exposed as he traces circuits with a sensor. Geordi<br>
    frowns to himself as he looks over to Barclay, whose<br>
    back is to him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (muttering, to himself)<br>
    My best friend.</p>
  <p> He sighs, knows what he has to do, crosses to...</p>
  <p>6B ANGLE - BARCLAY</p>
  <p> wrapped up in his mystery... Geordi moves up behind<br>
    him, and as he pats him on the back...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hey, Reg...</p>
  <p> And Barclay nearly jumps out of his shoes at the<br>
    unexpected physical contact... Geordi reacts, covers...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Uh, how's it going?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Oh, it's... I still haven't traced<br>
    the problem, Commander...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (smile, &quot;warm&quot;)<br>
    That's okay. No rush. Take your<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> Barclay notes this new tone of voice from Geordi...<br>
    glances at him suspiciously... a beat. Doesn't trust<br>
    the moment... rushes to fill the gap...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I've... I've been planning to run<br>
    diagnostics on the graviton<br>
    invertor circuits...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot; - REV. 2/9/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>6B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Smart plan... well, I'd say we're<br>
    in good hands here...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (still suspicious)<br>
    I'll get a preliminary report to<br>
    you...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    ...whenever.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Before the end of the day.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Fine. And say, Reg, how about<br>
    sitting in on the mission briefing<br>
    with my senior officers in the<br>
    morning...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    The briefing? Me?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'd just like your input...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    On what? I mean, should I prepare<br>
    something...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No... no... just be there. Eight<br>
    hundred hours.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I'll be on time, sir.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> And he's about to pat Barclay on the back once more,<br>
    thinks better of it... as he turns to leave, an<br>
    exasperated expression fills his face... and Barclay<br>
    sighs, glad this is over.</p>
  <p>6C EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>

  <p> Geordi ENTERS with WESLEY...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Morning. Start your brains, and<br>
    let's do it.</p>
  <p> They all gather around the pool table for the morning<br>
    briefing. After a beat, Barclay rushes in late, out of<br>
    breath... Geordi nods to him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (points to injectors<br>
    on schematic)<br>
    Okay, this trip to Nahmi Four is<br>
    pretty routine. We'll have plenty<br>
    of time to realign the magnetic<br>
    capacitors in both the matter and<br>
    anti-matter injectors.<br>
    (light hearted groans)<br>
    Duffy, Costa, that'll be your<br>
    assignment.</p>

    Good idea.<br>

    Ensign Crusher is putting in some<br>
    hours with us this week as part<br>
    of his training duties... he'll<br>
    be assigned to assist you, Mister<br>
    Myers. Be sure and teach him the<br>
    difference between impulse and<br>
    warp drive.<br>

    Lieutenant Barclay is working on<br>
    the mystery of the anti-grav<br>
    failure we had yesterday... your<br>
    preliminary report had a couple<br>
    of interesting theories, Reg...</p>
  <p> Geordi waits a beat for Barclay to pick it up and run<br>
    with it. He doesn't. After an awkward beat...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot; - REV. 2/19/90 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Why don't you summarize your<br>
    findings so far, Reg...</p>
  <p> As Barclay begins to answer, we can see him growing<br>
    more and more uncomfortable under the gaze of his<br>
    fellow engineers.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Yes.<br>
    (clears his throat)<br>
    It wasn't a maintenance problem...<br>
    everything checked out. I...<br>
    I'm going to check for... a surge<br>
    in... the transfer coils.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (certain)<br>
    A coil surge wouldn't have<br>
    resulted in a field dissipation.</p>
  <p> Attention now focuses on Wesley. Barclay flushes<br>
    slightly as Wesley inadvertently steals his thunder.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I... I... I realize that...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (trying to rescue the<br>
    the situation)<br>
    But we shouldn't ignore the<br>
    possibility, Wes...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You ought to take a look at the<br>
    flow capacitor. That could<br>
    have forced a chain collapse of<br>
    the antigrav field.</p>
  <p> Everyone looks at Barclay again.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I... was going to.</p>
  <p> And it looks like Barclay is just jumping on Wesley's<br>
    idea... Geordi wants to bail out of this...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Good. Okay, then... let's go over<br>
    the realignment procedure...</p>

  <p> As Geordi starts to go on with the rest of the meeting,<br>
    we PUSH IN on Barclay's terribly uncomfortable<br>
    expression...</p>
  <p>8 INT. TROI'S OFFICE (HOLODECK)</p>
  <p> It appears that Barclay is in therapy with Troi. She<br>
    sits, listening intently... Barclay pacing the office<br>
    in front of her. When he speaks, it is forceful,<br>
    without hesitation.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I just didn't know what to say.</p>
  <p> HOLO-TROI<br>
    What do you wish you had said?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I should have told him to mind<br>
    his own damned business... I knew<br>
    about the flow capacitor... I<br>
    didn't need to hear about it from<br>
    a seventeen year old kid.</p>
  <p> HOLO-TROI<br>
    You're letting it get you much<br>
    too upset.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    You think so?</p>
  <p> Holo-Troi gives him a very sympathetic look, gets up<br>
    and stands closer to him.</p>
  <p> HOLO-TROI<br>
    Why are you so hard on yourself?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    You don't know... it's hard out<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> HOLO-TROI<br>
    I understand, but let go of it.<br>
    You're here now.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You're right, of course.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot; - REV. 2/13/90 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> HOLO-TROI<br>
    (a small smile)<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> She reaches out for him as if to comfort him, but<br>
    instead begins to caress his arms and shoulders while<br>
    her stance and expression take on a smoldering<br>
    sexuality.</p>
  <p> HOLO-TROI<br>
    Let me help you relax.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I'd like that.</p>
  <p> HOLO-TROI<br>
    I knew you would.</p>
  <p> And she leans into him, puts her arms around him and<br>
    kisses him passionately...</p>
  <p>8A NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Mmm, nice... but I'm in the mood<br>
    for someplace a little more...<br>
    unusual...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Computer. Run Barclay Program<br>
    Fifteen.</p>
  <p> We stay on Barclay, but lose Holo-Troi, as the<br>
    surroundings change to --</p>
  <p>9 EXT. GLADE (HOLODECK)</p>
  <p> A glade with a few small hills, rock formations, some<br>
    trees, grass, a pond. As different as can be from the<br>
    world Barclay lives in... peaceful, green, remote...<br>
    a warm breeze flutters through the trees... Barclay<br>
    takes a deep, cleansing breath... turns to see ---</p>
  <p>9A ANGLE - HOLO-TROI</p>
  <p> dressed in flowing Grecian robes which reveal a good<br>
    deal of her anatomy, atop a part of a crumbling wall or<br>
    section of ruins, stunning... as the breeze lifts her<br>
    hair, her robes... and she reaches out to Barclay...</p>

    But I thought that's the point<br>
    of the briefing... to discuss<br>
    different approaches...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm not saying you did anything<br>
    wrong, Wes... it's just that<br>
    Barclay's... well, my new<br>

    Yeah, Broccoli's a real project<br>
    all right...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (frowns, hates the job)<br>
    I just gotta draw him out more...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    And I shut him down.<br>
    (with pity)<br>
    Poor Broccoli.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Pardon me, but why is Lieutenant<br>
    Barclay being referred to<br>
    clandestinely as a vegetable?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's a joke, Data... you know,<br>
    a nickname.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot; - REV. 2/9/90 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Nicknames generally denote<br>
    fondness, a diminutive shared<br>
    between friends. This does not<br>
    sound friendly.</p>
  <p> He's got them there. Wesley and Duffy look a little<br>
    uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data's absolutely right. The<br>
    nickname stops here and now.<br>
    Captain's orders.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the glass in Duffy's hand begins leaking<br>
    badly... the drink spilling on the table...</p>
  <p> DUFFY<br>
    What the hell... ?</p>
  <p> He stands and puts the glass down... and the others<br>
    react, and Geordi throws a napkin on the table to catch<br>
    the liquid...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What happened to your glass?</p>
  <p> And push in as Data picks it up... the glass has been<br>
    mangled in the shape of Duffy's hand. On reactions...</p>

  <p>11 EXT SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Moving at warp speed.</p>
  <p>12 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi are examining the glass from Ten<br>
    Forward with a tricorder and one of the consoles on the<br>
    bulkhead. Barclay is in the b.g. working on some<br>
    console.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Nucleo-synthesis. The structure<br>
    of the glass has been altered at<br>
    the atomic level.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    A problem with the replicator?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Unlikely. A problem with the<br>
    replicator would have affected<br>
    the contents as well as the glass.<br>
    But the liquid in the glass was<br>
    a perfect replication of a dark<br>
    ale of Earth origin which I<br>
    believe is what Lieutenant Duffy<br>
    ordered.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I can't detect any residual<br>
    radiation or unusual chemical<br>
    compounds that would have caused<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The most probable explanation is<br>
    that the glass came into contact<br>
    with an unshielded power source.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (slightly dismayed)<br>
    That means a complete diagnostic<br>

    Hey, Barclay... I've spent a few<br>
    hours in the Holodeck myself, you<br>

  <p> Barclay gives him a look... and this is the first real<br>
    compassion that Geordi has had for Barclay.</p>

    Okay, it was you. And I couldn't<br>

    for the best... I just wanted to<br>
