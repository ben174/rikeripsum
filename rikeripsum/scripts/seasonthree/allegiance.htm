    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (STOCK OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around a blue-green planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43714.1.<br>
    We have finally succeeded in<br>
    eradicating the plague on Cor<br>
    Caroli Five, and are now<br>
    preparing to leave orbit and<br>
    proceed to our next mission --</p>
  <p>2 OMITTED</p>
  <p>3 INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD is relaxing on a recliner-type chair, reading<br>
    an antique leather-bound book. An empty brandy snifter<br>
    is nearby. CLASSICAL MUSIC plays softly.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    -- a rendezvous with the USS<br>
    Hood to assist their terraforming<br>
    efforts on Browder Four.</p>
  <p> After a moment, Picard lays the book over his chest and<br>
    closes his eyes.</p>
  <p> Almost immediately, a body-length metallic slab<br>
    MATERIALIZES directly over the sleeping Picard. The<br>
    slab emits a BEAM which scans the captain from head to<br>
    toe. Once the scan is complete, the beam stops and<br>
    Picard DEMATERIALIZES in a new, ALIEN TRANSPORTER<br>
    EFFECT.</p>
  <p>4 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> RIKER, WORF, DATA, and supernumeraries are at their<br>
    posts. Data reacts to something on his console.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - 1/15/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander, ship's sensors detect<br>
    an abnormal energy reading in the<br>
    captain's quarters.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Type?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Undetermined.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Riker to Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> No answer; after a beat, Riker turns to Worf who is<br>
    already on the move toward the turbolift.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Security team to captain's<br>
    quarters --</p>
  <p>5 INT. HOLDING BAY</p>
  <p> CLOSE on Picard as he slowly awakens and looks around<br>
    -- and is stunned to see he's no longer on the<br>
    Enterprise. Instead, he's in a large square, empty,<br>
    windowless, rather featureless room. One door -- which<br>
    is solidly shut.</p>
  <p> Each corner of the room contains a &quot;bunk&quot; (a small<br>
    padded area slightly raised from floor level); in the<br>
    center of the room is a &quot;feeder&quot; (a simple dispenser<br>
    filled with what looks like hockey pucks). Picard's on<br>
    one &quot;bunk,&quot; another is vacant. The remaining two are<br>
    occupied by unconscious -- or possibly dead --<br>
    humanoids: MITENA HARO (a &quot;Bolian&quot; -- young, female<br>
    Starfleet cadet) and KOVA THOLL (a &quot;Mizarian&quot; --<br>
    middle-aged male civilian).</p>
  <p>6 ON PICARD</p>
  <p> as he gets to his feet, taps his insignia:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard to Enterprise.</p>
  <p> No response; not even the beep to indicate the<br>
    communicator's working. Picard suspects it's futile,<br>
    but tries again;</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - 1/15/90 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    Anyone receiving this<br>
    transmission, please respond.</p>
  <p> Nothing. Picard scowls.</p>
  <p>7 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Worf and security team are at the captain's door. Worf<br>
    touches the CHIME. No response.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Security override. Priority one.</p>
  <p> but before he can finish the door OPENS to reveal<br>
    Picard -- actually a perfect replica of Picard --<br>
    staring back at Worf and the security team.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    Is something the matter,<br>
    Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> On Worf's relieved and embarrassed expression:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - REV. 1/19/90 - ACT ONE 4.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>8 INT. HOLDING BAY</p>
  <p> Picard crosses to the motionless Haro, kneels at her<br>
    side, touches her carotid artery to check for pulse.<br>
    Haro stirs, awakens -- realizes someone's close, and<br>
    panics, reflexively swinging an arm at the stranger.<br>
    Picard's ready for it, blocks the blow by seizing<br>
    Haro's wrist, whispers to calm her:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's all right. I'm not going<br>
    to hurt you.</p>
  <p> HARO<br>
    Who -- ?</p>
  <p> Haro slowly relaxes. Picard lets her go; she sits up,<br>
    notices Picard's rank.</p>
  <p> HARO (cont'd)<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> HARO<br>
    Captain Picard! We've studied<br>
    your missions at the Academy...</p>
  <p> Haro realizes she's being less than professional,<br>
    straightens up:</p>
  <p> HARO (cont'd)<br>
    Mitena Haro, first year cadet,<br>
    Starfleet Academy.</p>
  <p> Picard nods acknowledgement, but before he can respond:</p>
  <p> THOLL (O.S.)<br>
    Perhaps you can explain what this<br>
    is all about.</p>
  <p>9 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Tholl is sitting up, regarding Picard with a mixture<br>
    of suspicion and disdain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - REV. 1/22/90 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Unfortunately, I can't, Mister...</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    Tholl. Kova Tholl, of Mizar Two.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, Mister Tholl, all I know<br>
    is that I've been brought here<br>
    against my will.<br>
    (gestures)<br>
    Wherever &quot;here&quot; is...</p>
  <p> HARO<br>
    The same thing happened to me,<br>
    sir. I was alone, studying...<br>
    and I fainted. When I came to...<br>
    (gestures)<br>
    That was about three days ago.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Tholl)<br>
    And you, sir?</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    I've been here twelve days,<br>
    possibly more. I had been<br>
    meditating privately -- and for no<br>
    reason whatever, I lost<br>
    consciousness.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What can you tell me about our<br>
    captors?</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    Nothing. They've never shown<br>
    themselves.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - REV. 1/22/90 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>10 ON PICARD</p>
  <p> as he moves around, inspecting the walls. Haro follows<br>
    Picard, keeping a respectful distance.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Four sleeping areas... that<br>
    implies we'll be joined by another<br>
    captive...</p>
  <p> Picard stops at the feeder, pulls out a &quot;hockey puck&quot;<br>
    -- it's a dark, translucent disk of solid but malleable<br>
    material, sort of a gigantic gumdrop. Not very<br>
    appealing. Picard pulls off a small hunk, examines<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Food?</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    (making a face)<br>
    It's edible... but I wouldn't call<br>
    it food.</p>
  <p>11 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Picard moves to the door, examines it. Next to the<br>
    door is a small panel flush with the wall -- a key<br>
    panel? It appears to be -- it's divided into a grid<br>
    of sub-panels, each with an alien symbol upon it.<br>
    Picard presses one; it lights up briefly and makes a<br>
    short, annoying BEEP SOUND. He tries another -- same<br>
    result.</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    I wouldn't touch that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why not?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - REV. 1/22/90 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    If it's the door lock, the<br>
    combination is too complex to hit<br>
    at random -- I tried it, and was<br>
    punished.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Punished -- how?</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    Severe pain... some sort of energy<br>
    beam.<br>
    (shudders at the memory)<br>
    I won't get near that panel<br>
    again...</p>
  <p> Picard leaves the panel alone for the moment, inspects<br>
    the door itself. Haro steps up -- and a little of her<br>
    insecurity and fear show through:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - REV. 1/22/90 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> HARO<br>
    The Enterprise will find us, won't<br>
    it, sir? As soon as they discover<br>
    you're missing, they'll start to<br>
    search... Won't they?</p>
  <p> Picard realizes Haro needs a dose of morale-building:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course they will. They'll do<br>
    everything they can. In the<br>
    meantime, we keep our heads...<br>
    (wryly indicating the<br>
    room)<br>
    ... and enjoy the hospitality.</p>
  <p> Haro takes courage from Picard's words, manages a<br>
    smile.</p>
  <p> HARO<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p>12<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    14</p>
  <p>15 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Data, WESLEY, Worf, supernumeraries. False<br>
    Picard ENTERS from the turbolift.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, the Hood has arrived at the<br>
    rendezvous point. They are<br>
    expecting us in thirty-six hours.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    Thank you, Lieutenant.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Mister Data. The nearest pulsar<br>
    is in the Lonka cluster, is it<br>
    not?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Correct, sir.</p>
  <p> Everyone is a bit surprised: why has the captain<br>
    brought this up? Unfortunately for them, he's keeping<br>
    his reasons to himself.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - REV. 1/17/90 - ACT ONE 8A.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    And what do we know about that<br>
    pulsar?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - REV. 1/17/90 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A great deal, sir. It is a<br>
    rotating neutron star of<br>
    approximately four point three<br>
    five six solar masses.</p>
  <p> False Picard considers this for a moment, then:</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    Mister Crusher -- how long would<br>
    it take us to get there?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    At warp seven... thirty-four<br>
    minutes.</p>
  <p> False Picard takes another moment to consider this.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    Mister Crusher -- make it so.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> Wesley is a bit surprised.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    Set course for the Lonka pulsar.<br>
    Warp two.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Wesley hesitates before adding:</p>
  <p> WESLEY (cont'd)<br>
    Sir, at warp two -- we'll arrive<br>
    at the pulsar in thirty-one<br>
    hours...</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    Thank you, Ensign. Engage.</p>
  <p> The stars on the viewscreen STREAK into warp. Riker<br>
    is slightly puzzled; he half-expects the captain to<br>
    elaborate or explain the change in plans. After a<br>
    beat, it's clear no explanation is forthcoming.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, are we delaying our<br>
    rendezvous with the Hood?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - REV. 1/17/90 - ACT ONE 9A.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    We may have to.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - REV. 1/18/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> That's all False Picard offers. Riker takes it from<br>
    there:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Worf, contact the Hood and<br>
    inform them of our delay.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, Commander.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    Belay that.<br>
    (firm, not angry)<br>
    There'll be no further<br>
    communications off this ship<br>
    without my prior authorization.</p>
  <p> False Picard turns to Riker.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    Commander -- I'd like a word with<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> False Picard gets up and heads for the Ready Room.<br>
    Riker is right behind.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Mister Data -- you have the<br>
    bridge.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> False Picard and Riker EXIT.</p>
  <p>15A ON WESLEY</p>
  <p> glancing over towards Data.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Data -- any guesses as to what<br>
    this is all about?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I see no point in randomly<br>
    selecting alternative motivations<br>
    for the captain's actions<br>
    considering that not enough<br>
    information has been offered to<br>
    make any one &quot;guess&quot; superior to<br>
    another.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - REV. 1/17/90 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>15A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    In other words, you don't know<br>
    either.</p>
  <p> Wesley returns his attention to his console.</p>
  <p>15B INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> False Picard is leaning on his desk; Riker stands<br>
    before him.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    Number One... You know I like to<br>
    keep you well informed as to the<br>
    nature of our missions.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    And if I don't inform you --<br>
    there's a reason.</p>
  <p> Riker nods.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    I don't like keeping you in the<br>
    dark, Commander... but for the<br>
    next few days I won't be able to<br>
    be as communicative as usual.<br>
    It may make things difficult for<br>
    you...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Don't worry about me, sir. I can<br>
    handle it.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    And the crew?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You can count on us all, sir.</p>
  <p> False Picard eyes Riker carefully. Riker has complete<br>
    faith in the captain.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    I appreciate that, Number One.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - 1/15/90 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>16 OMITTED</p>
  <p>17 INT. HOLDING BAY</p>
  <p> Picard, Haro, Tholl. Picard is again examining the<br>
    keypad next to the door. He thinks it over, starts<br>
    pushing just one of the panels in a repeating sequence<br>
    of numbers -- 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. Haro looks on with<br>
    interest, Tholl with ill-concealed skepticism.</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    Picard -- what are you doing?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Attempting to show our captors<br>
    that we possess intelligence.</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    You don't think they know that<br>
    already? They can hear us<br>
    talking...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They may not realize we are<br>
    communicating through language.</p>
  <p> HARO<br>
    Captain Picard's letting them know<br>
    that we comprehend mathematics...<br>
    by tapping out the first six prime<br>
    numbers.</p>
  <p> Tholl gives Haro a look -- &quot;you think I'm stupid?&quot;</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    I know what he's doing. I'm<br>
    trying to understand why.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    To get their attention.</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    Oh, you may get their attention,<br>
    all right... and they'll give you<br>
    a dose of agony for using the<br>
    keypad.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll take the chance. It's<br>
    imperative that we communicate<br>
    with our abductors... find out<br>
    what they want.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - REV. 1/22/90 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    Obviously, they want us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Obviously. But why? What made<br>
    our captors choose us? What makes<br>
    us special?</p>
  <p> Picard looks from Tholl to Haro. Haro's at a loss.<br>
    Her -- &quot;special?&quot;</p>
  <p> HARO<br>
    I couldn't say, Captain. I'm<br>
    certainly not special -- I'm just<br>
    one cadet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (points out)<br>
    You're a Bolian. There are very<br>
    few Bolians in Starfleet.</p>
  <p> HARO<br>
    I am one of three in the Academy.<br>
    The other two have academic<br>
    records much better than mine...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's your best area of study?</p>
  <p> HARO<br>
    Impulse propulsion systems. I'm<br>
    really good with field coils...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good enough to be useful to our<br>
    abductors?</p>
  <p> HARO<br>
    (it's a new thought)<br>
    I don't know. Maybe.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    But if they needed an engineer,<br>
    sir, why didn't they take a &quot;real&quot;<br>
    one? Why pick a Starfleet cadet?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That, I can't answer.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    The Bolians are maintaining an<br>
    uneasy truce with the Moropa,<br>
    are they not?</p>

  <p>17 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> HARO<br>
    That's right.<br>
    (looks around)<br>
    But this doesn't look like Moropa<br>
    technology... and, even assuming<br>
    the Moropa wanted me, why would<br>
    they want either of you?</p>
  <p>18 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Picard turns to Tholl, who anticipates his question.</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    I've never even heard of the<br>
    Moropa. My race has no enemies.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    None? In the last three hundred<br>
    years of Mizarian history, your<br>
    planet has been conquered six<br>
    times!</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    And we've survived by not<br>
    resisting. Mizarians value peace<br>
    above confrontation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then you have no idea who might<br>
    have done this.</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    No. I don't know of anyone who<br>
    bears malice toward my race.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Or against you personally?</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    You can't mean to suggest that<br>
    someone with a personal grudge<br>
    against me has gone to all this<br>
    trouble...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not suggesting anything. I'm<br>
    merely trying to come up with an<br>
    explanation for your abduction.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - REV. 1/22/90 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    I'm sorry, Picard -- I can't give<br>
    you one. I am neither important<br>
    enough to hold for ransom nor<br>
    radical enough to be dangerous.<br>
    I'm a simple public servant...<br>
    assistant to the regent of<br>
    Pozaron, our third-largest city.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nonetheless, Mister Tholl --</p>
  <p> Picard stops as an odd SOUND catches everyone's<br>
    attention. They turn to see:</p>
  <p>19 ANGLE TO INCLUDE THE EMPTY BUNK (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as a FORM begins to APPEAR (ALIEN TRANSPORTER EFFECT).</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It would seem a new arrival is<br>
    imminent...</p>
  <p> The FORM COALESCES -- revealing ESOQQ (of the Chalnoth<br>
    race) -- a large, hairy, nasty-looking brute of an<br>
    alien. Bad-tempered... and if his sharp teeth are any<br>
    indication, a meat-eater.</p>
  <p>20 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Esoqq looks around with surprise -- plainly he has<br>
    no idea what's happening to him. He sees the three<br>
    others in the room -- and his face contorts with rage.<br>
    He draws a weapon -- a mean-looking dagger or blade<br>
    of some sort.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stop! We mean you no harm...</p>
  <p> Picard spreads his hands in a gesture of peace. Esoqq<br>
    warily takes a step back -- and assumes an attack<br>
    posture. Picard motions for Tholl and Haro to stand<br>
    absolutely still. On the tense standoff, we --</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT ONE </p>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>21 INT. HOLDING BAY</p>
  <p> Esoqq holds the knife threateningly. Tholl and Haro<br>
    remain motionless as Picard tries to calm Esoqq:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are prisoners, like yourself!<br>
    We are not the enemy!</p>
  <p> The command in Picard's voice is compelling.<br>
    Gradually, Esoqq lowers the knife, eyes Picard darkly.</p>
  <p> ESOQQ<br>
    Who has done this?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We don't know. We were brought<br>
    here the same way you were. Our<br>
    captors refuse to show<br>
    themselves.</p>
  <p> Esoqq, unsure whether to believe Picard or not, looks<br>
    as if he may attack at any second.</p>
  <p> ESOQQ<br>
    I don't trust you...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You must trust us. We wish only<br>
    to return to our worlds. Were<br>
    you abducted from Chalna?</p>
  <p> ESOQQ<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    You know my planet?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - REV. 1/23/90 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. I visited there twelve<br>
    years ago.</p>
  <p> A long beat as it hangs in the balance. Then Esoqq<br>
    makes up his mind, sheathes his knife. Haro closes<br>
    her eyes, relieved. Picard merely nods acceptance.</p>
  <p>22 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> The poker game is on; Riker, Geordi, Worf, Troi, and<br>
    Data are seated at the table, enjoying the game as well<br>
    as the drinks and snacks. Troi has the largest pile of<br>
    chips. Riker tosses chips into the pot.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Your five... and twenty more.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Ouch.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If it's too rich, fold.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm thinking, I'm thinking...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Think less, play more.</p>
  <p> Geordi looks at his cards again. Riker, looking at<br>
    Geordi, makes a CLUCKING sound -- &quot;chicken!&quot;</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I say he folds.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe you are incorrect,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - REV. 1/16/90 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA (Cont'd)<br>
    In situations where more than two<br>
    players have asked for three cards<br>
    and the minimum raise was ten,<br>
    Geordi has stayed in the game<br>
    seventy-three percent of the<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I still say he folds.</p>
  <p> They all look at Geordi: &quot;Well?&quot; Geordi puts in his<br>
    chips.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't want to hurt my average.</p>
  <p> As everyone CHUCKLES, the CHIME SOUNDS.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Enter.</p>
  <p> The doors OPEN and the False Picard ENTERS. The<br>
    CHUCKLES die down -- everyone's surprised to see the<br>
    captain.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    Counselor, gentlemen. Forgive<br>
    the intrusion... I was just<br>
    passing by.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are always welcome, Captain.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    Don't let me interrupt... please<br>
    continue.</p>
  <p> The mood of the table has shifted somewhat with the<br>
    captain's presence. The play continues but the<br>
    frivolity and banter are muted.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Bet is twenty-five to you,<br>
    Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> Worf scowls at his cards, locks eyes with Riker.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You are bluffing.</p>
  <p> Riker's expression is unreadable. Worf gives in:</p>

  <p>22 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF (cont'd)<br>
    So was I.</p>
  <p> Worf folds. Riker turns to Troi, but before he can<br>
    speak:</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    I was wondering, Mister La<br>
    Forge... what's our engine<br>
    efficiency status?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Operating at ninety-three percent,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> False Picard considers this information, then:</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    That's good, but I'd like to<br>
    increase that efficiency to<br>
    ninety-five percent.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - REV. 1/16/90 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll get on it right away, sir.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    It wasn't an order, Mister La<br>
    Forge. You can get to it later.</p>
  <p> An awkward moment -- Geordi's not quite sure if the<br>
    captain is kidding.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    I don't wish to disrupt your<br>
    recreation.</p>
  <p> Geordi decides the captain is just being considerate.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No problem, sir.<br>
    (regarding the game)<br>
    Lady Luck left me long ago.</p>
  <p> Geordi tosses in his hand, EXITS.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Would you care to join us, sir?<br>
    We have an opening.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    I'd rather just observe, if you<br>
    don't mind.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Of course not.<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Your bet, Counselor.</p>
  <p> All eyes go to Troi, who matches the bet. Data does<br>
    also.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Pair of threes.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Flush. Queen high.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That beats my three fours.</p>
  <p> As Troi takes the pile of chips:</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    Well played, Counselor.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    May I have a word with you?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Certainly, sir.</p>
  <p> As Worf shuffles and deals, Troi gets up and follows<br>
    False Picard.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    Forgive me, gentlemen. I'll<br>
    return your player in a moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (in fun)<br>
    Take your time, sir... she's won<br>

  <p>23A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    I wanted to ask you about the<br>
    crew... how are they reacting to<br>
    our sudden change in course?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I've sensed no unusual reaction,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> Troi is curious about the captain's question; there<br>
    hardly seems a reason to be concerned.</p>
  <p> TROI (cont'd)<br>
    After all -- such a change is<br>
    hardly out of the ordinary.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    Aren't they curious or concerned<br>
    as to why?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Curious, yes -- concerned, no.<br>
    They trust you.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    And how far do you think that<br>

  <p> That's an odd question from Picard. Troi is taken<br>
    aback.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> False Picard realizes he's pushing it. He backs off:</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    I'd inform you, sir... of course.</p>
  <p> False Picard nods, then prepares to exit.</p>

    My given name is Esoqq.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Has it a meaning?</p>
  <p> ESOQQ<br>
    Yes... it means &quot;fighter.&quot;</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    (with disdain)<br>
    I'll bet half the names in the<br>
    Chalnoth language mean &quot;fighter.&quot;</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - REV. 1/22/90 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Esoqq looks disparagingly at Tholl.</p>

    A race of cowards.<br>

    And you? I don't know your<br>

  <p> Haro doesn't know how to deal with Esoqq, looks<br>
    nervously to Picard for guidance. Picard nods to her<br>
    -- go ahead and answer.</p>
  <p> HARO<br>
    I am Mitena Haro, of Bolarus Nine.<br>
    (then adds)<br>
    I'm a Bolian.</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>

    Yes, that would follow.</p>

    I'm not a &quot;child&quot; --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (intervenes)<br>
    Esoqq -- I've been trying to<br>
    determine if we have a common<br>
    enemy... someone who'd have reason<br>
    to confine us here.</p>
  <p> Esoqq gives it thought.</p>

    You have many enemies?</p>
  <p> ESOQQ<br>
    None of consequence. I've slain<br>

  <p> Haro can't help a GASP. Esoqq hears it.</p>

    That shocks you, Bolian?</p>

    A little...</p>
  <p> Esoqq looks to Tholl -- &quot;and you?&quot;</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    I'm not surprised... I've heard<br>
    about your race. You're<br>
    uncivilized -- you have no laws,<br>
    no system of government --</p>
  <p> ESOQQ<br>
    The Chalnoth have no use for laws<br>
    or governments! We are strong<br>
    -- we obey no one.</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    You live in anarchy, murdering<br>

    The Federation's in conflict with<br>
    half the galaxy.</p>
  <p> Haro jumps to the Federation's defense:</p>
  <p> HARO<br>
    That's not true --</p>
  <p> Picard signals Haro to calm down and let Tholl speak.</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    Isn't it? How long have you and<br>
    the Romulans been adversaries?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (unruffled)<br>
    Quite a while, Mister Tholl. And<br>
    I'm perfectly willing to entertain<br>
    the hypothesis that our captors<br>
    are Romulans.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    But what would Romulans want with<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    My brainpower, perhaps. It's well<br>

    The only food?</p>

    It would seem so.</p>

  <p> Beverly doesn't quite buy it; her logical conclusion is<br>
    that there is something wrong that Picard isn't telling<br>
    her. With genuine concern and openness, Beverly looks<br>
    False Picard in the eye:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    We can no longer afford to be<br>
    patient. If we don't act soon,<br>
    Esoqq will starve...</p>

  <p> HARO<br>
    The design is simple... crosscircuiting<br>

  <p> False Picard, dressed in formal evening attire, sits<br>
    across a table from Beverly -- looking lovelier than<br>
    ever in her evening dress. Soft MUSIC and candlelight<br>
    set the atmosphere. The captain and Beverly have<br>
    finished their meal and are enjoying the last few sips<br>
    of a dessert champagne. Beverly smiles.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Out with it, Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    Out with what?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Whatever's been on your mind all<br>
    evening long.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    Has it been that apparent?</p>

  <p> FALSE PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    You know me well, don't you?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    After all this time, I ought to.</p>
  <p> False Picard gazes at the candles for a beat, then<br>
    turns to Beverly:</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    I have been preoccupied. I've<br>
    been thinking about us... and the<br>
    choices I've made.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We've both made choices...</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    And I've been wondering if they've<br>
    been the right ones.<br>

    Sometimes I feel we've allowed<br>

    Our positions necessitate a degree<br>

    too detached... in never allowing<br>
    ourselves to get closer.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (direct)<br>
    Is that what you want, Jean-Luc?<br>
    To get closer?</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    You're a very attractive woman.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And you're a very attractive man.<br>
    But we both know it's not as<br>
    simple as that.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    Would it be simpler if I weren't<br>
    your commanding officer?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Simpler, perhaps, but... that's not<br>
    the only issue.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Right now, I guess, I'm comfortable<br>
    with our relationship the way it is.</p>
  <p> False Picard nods, understanding her position.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    Then I'll respect that.</p>
  <p> Beverly smiles -- &quot;you're a good friend.&quot; False Picard<br>
    smiles back.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    Would you care to dance?</p>
  <p> Beverly holds out her hand.</p>

  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    I don't know if I've ever told<br>
    you... but I'm glad you're back<br>
    on the Enterprise. I missed<br>

    So did I...</p>
  <p>33 CLOSER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the captain holds her near... His arm curls around<br>
    hers... They get closer... cheek-to-cheek. As they<br>
    dance, the mood changes -- the sexual tension becomes<br>
    undeniable. False Picard's arm tightens around her<br>
    waist...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - REV. 1/17/90 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> They continue to dance... the captain and Beverly look<br>
    at one another -- their lips almost touching... and<br>
    then False Picard kisses her. Immediately, Beverly<br>
    pulls away.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jean-Luc, if I didn't know you<br>
    better... I'd think you were<br>
    playing games with me.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    Are you sorry you came here<br>
    tonight?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I didn't say that.</p>
  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    Good. Because I'm delighted you<br>
    did. But perhaps we should call<br>
    it a night.</p>
  <p> And with that, the captain leads Beverly to the door;<br>
    it OPENS.</p>
  <p> Beverly is momentarily bewildered -- she didn't expect<br>

    feet away.</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    I warned you not to provoke our<br>
    captors. The next beams might<br>
    be lethal.</p>

  <p> ESOQQ<br>
    Not to you. You moved far from<br>
    the door...</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    Of course I did! Being stunned<br>
    once was enough.</p>
  <p> ESOQQ<br>
    You claim you were hit by the stun<br>
    beam... before the rest of us<br>
    arrived. You could be lying.<br>
    Maybe our enemy is watching us...<br>
    from inside.</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>

  <p> Getting steadily angrier, Esoqq advances toward Tholl.<br>
    Even Haro is looking at Tholl with new eyes. Tholl's<br>
    getting desperate:</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    This is nonsense! What if you're<br>
    an impostor?<br>
    (to Picard and Haro)<br>
    Esoqq was the last one to<br>

    with a weapon...</p>
  <p> ESOQQ<br>
    Which I may still use...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tholl -- our captors have<br>
    transporters and stun beams. I<br>
    hardly think they'd try to keep<br>
    us at bay with a knife.</p>
  <p> Tholl looks about for a new scapegoat:</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    (re Haro)<br>
    Then maybe she's an impostor.<br>
    She could have triggered the stun<br>
    beams deliberately.</p>
  <p> HARO<br>
    I was hit, too...</p>

  <p> Haro, despite herself, takes a second look at Picard:<br>
    is it possible? Might he be a double?</p>
  <p> THOLL<br>
    You've wasted our time with failed<br>

    You're endangering this ship...<br>

  <p> FALSE PICARD<br>
    No reason you're aware of.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's not good enough. Your<br>
    behavior has been erratic --</p>

    as if he expected exactly that, hands the knife back.</p>
  <p> Haro reaches into the bulkhead, manipulates circuitry<br>

    even more surprised to see what the open door reveals:</p>

  <p> ESOQQ<br>
    How do you know?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's the only explanation. Look<br>

    our rendezvous with the Hood...<br>
    Warp eight.</p>
  <p> Everyone's delighted to have the real captain back.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Aye aye, sir.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    It's good to have you back.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - REV. 1/19/90 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>64 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Smiles of agreement from the rest of the bridge crew.<br>
    Picard permits himself the tiniest of smiles in<br>
    acknowledgement, turns to Riker:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Status, Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ship and crew functioning<br>
    normally, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then my doppelganger caused no<br>
    serious damage.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Was the replica convincing?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Very convincing, sir -- but not<br>
    perfect.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not perfect in what way?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well, sir...<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    ... for one, I simply cannot<br>
    believe you're that good a singer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A singer?</p>
  <p> Riker can't hide his grin. Picard looks at him<br>
    suspiciously, decides not to pursue it for the moment.<br>
    In b.g. Beverly ENTERS.</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    I look forward to reading your<br>
    report, Commander. At least, I<br>
    think I do.</p>
  <p> Picard notices that Beverly's on the bridge. They nod<br>
    in greeting:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor...</p>
  <p> Their eyes meet for a moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Allegiance&quot; - REV. 1/19/90 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>64 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Course laid in, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Engage.</p>
  <p>65 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> turning to its new heading... and blasting into warp.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
