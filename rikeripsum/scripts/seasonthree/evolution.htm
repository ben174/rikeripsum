  <p> at impulse speed entering a double star system<br>
    composed of a small neutron star orbiting a red giant<br>
    star.</p>
  <p>2 INT. SICKBAY LAB - CLOSE ON A TEXTBOOK</p>
  <p> something in advanced genetics... lying flat on a lab<br>
    tabletop. The camera moves slowly along the table to<br>
    see the paraphernalia of a long night of studying --<br>
    containers, microscope, some half-eaten new generation<br>
    pizza and an almost finished glass of milk... finding a<br>
    still hand... and moving up the arm to find WESLEY;<br>
    face flat on the table, eyes closed... and for a beat<br>
    we may wonder what's happened to him... but then --</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Commander Riker to Ensign Crusher.</p>
  <p> Wesley's eyes jerk open... head turns -- where am I,<br>
    omigod, I fell asleep....</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>

    Go ahead....</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Forget to set your alarm, Wesley?</p>

  <p> Wesley scurrying around to clean up the lab top... put<br>
    away his experiment and equipment...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Evolution&quot; - REV. 7/25/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> he notices one of the containers is open, briefly<br>
    reacts, quickly closes it... it's barely noted and<br>
    buried in the humor of the moment.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Uh, yessir. I'm... very sorry.<br>
    I'll be right there.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    I didn't think you'd want to miss<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> Wesley takes one more last look around the room...<br>
    exits quickly, brushing his hair into some semblance of<br>
    neatness.</p>
  <p>5 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - VIEWSCREEN - THE DOUBLE STARS<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43102.8.<br>
    We have entered a spectacular<br>
    double star system in the Kavis<br>
    Alpha sector on a most critical<br>
    mission of astro-physical<br>
    research.</p>
  <p> Finding a slightly disheveled man in his sixties (DOCTOR<br>
    STUBBS) in casual clothes observing data processing<br>
    on the bridge. The sparkle in his eye is the only hint<br>
    of his excitement and anticipation... otherwise, he<br>
    has the confidence of a man who already knows the<br>
    answer to a question about to be posed.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Our eminent guest, Doctor Paul<br>
    Stubbs, will attempt to study the<br>
    decay of globules of neutronium<br>
    expelled at relativistic speeds<br>
    by a massive stellar explosion<br>
    which will occur here in a matter<br>
    of hours.</p>
  <p> Wesley ENTERS the bridge, looking embarrassed, glances<br>
    at Stubbs who smiles at him. Wesley sits at his<br>
    station.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Evolution&quot; - 7/24/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It is virtually a<br>
    once-in-a-lifetime opportunity<br>
    as dictated by the forces of<br>
    nature. But frankly, Doctor<br>
    Stubbs seems much calmer about<br>
    it all than those of us who are<br>
    simply charged with the<br>
    responsibility of delivery and<br>
    observation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ensign, our position....</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Approaching ten million kilometers<br>
    from the neutron star...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Slow to one third impulse power...</p>
  <p> Stubbs stands by Wesley as the viewscreen shows a<br>
    stream of hydrogen and helium torn from the red giant<br>
    spiraling toward the neutron star.</p>
  <p> STUBBS<br>
    Spectacular, isn't it, my young<br>
    friend?</p>
  <p> His voice is as warm as a grandfather's.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yessir.</p>
  <p> And he might as well be in his classroom, the professor<br>
    sharing the excitement with a young student.</p>
  <p> STUBBS<br>
    Over and over again, the intense<br>
    gravitational pull of the little<br>
    neutron star sucks up the star material<br>
    from the red giant, and<br>
    it builds up on the surface until<br>
    it explodes... every one hundred<br>
    and ninety six years. Like<br>
    clockwork. And it is but eighteen<br>
    hours away.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Eighteen hours, seven minutes,<br>
    and ... ten seconds, Doctor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Evolution&quot; - REV. 7/25/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> STUBBS<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    The interstellar counterpart to<br>
    Earth's &quot;Old Faithful&quot;. The only<br>
    predictable burst of energy in<br>
    the universe that can accomplish<br>
    our goal.</p>
  <p> PICARD ENTERS from the Ready Room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor Stubbs, if you want to make<br>
    a final inspection of the unit...</p>
  <p> STUBBS<br>
    Captain, I've been inspecting the<br>
    egg for twenty years... you may<br>
    lay it when ready.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker react to his offhanded confidence...</p>

    Standing by, Commander...</p>

  <p> STUBBS<br>

    experiment will last, Wesley... ?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>

  <p> STUBBS<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    Now, how would you know that?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Evolution&quot; - REV. 7/25/89 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    When I heard we were going to be<br>
    part of your experiment, I read<br>
    all your published works.</p>
  <p> Stubbs reacts, impressed.</p>

  <p>25 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Wesley moving... sees a trio of other teenagers, two<br>
    attractive girls and one boy, dressed in ski clothes...</p>
  <p> ERIC<br>
    (friendly)<br>
    Hey, Wesley, you need some work<br>
    on your right turns...</p>
  <p> Wesley pauses, responding a little too seriously for<br>
    a teenager.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    They're running a check to find<br>
    out what happened. Everything's<br>
    okay now...</p>
  <p> One of the girls, ANNETTE, is clearly interested in<br>
    Wes.</p>
  <p> ANNETTE<br>
    We're going into the Holodeck to<br>
    ski in Switzerland, Wes... want<br>
    to come?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Oh... I can't... I have to check<br>
    on Doctor Stubbs. He's in<br>
    Sickbay...</p>
  <p> Annette looks disappointed. Eric takes him aside out<br>
    of earshot... puts his arm around his shoulder.</p>
  <p> ERIC<br>
    Wesley, I have this awkward<br>
    situation... Two gorgeous ladies,<br>
    only one of me and a terrific<br>
    program where we get snowed in<br>
    at the ski lodge... just the fire<br>
    and each other to keep us warm...<br>
    (looks for a reaction)<br>
    I can hold the storm for you...<br>
    meet us at the lodge later on.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I can't, Eric. There's just too<br>
    much to do...</p>
  <p> ERIC<br>
    (strained)<br>
    Yeah, okay... next time.</p>
  <p> Annette glances at him as they split up.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Evolution&quot; - REV. 7/25/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>26 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Several bruises from the incident are being treated...<br>
    DOCTOR CRUSHER treats Stubbs' back as Wesley ENTERS.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    The captain asked me to tell you<br>
    that our systems are back to<br>
    normal and we can make another<br>
    launch attempt as soon as you're<br>
    ready.</p>
  <p> Stubbs nods with a deceptively amiable grin. Beverly<br>
    uses a medical tricorder.</p>
  <p> STUBBS<br>
    Quite a dynamic family team, you<br>
    Crushers....</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (smiles at her son)<br>
    It's nice to be back together.<br>
    I was at Starfleet Medical for<br>
    a year... I missed about two<br>
    inches of him.</p>
  <p> And a lot more. We may sense here that as she listens,<br>
    Beverly is considering her relationship with her son...</p>
  <p> STUBBS<br>
    I'm not sure I'd want my mother<br>
    to be flying through space with<br>
    me... no, I take that back. I<br>
    am sure. I wouldn't want her.<br>
    I love her dearly you understand.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (poking)<br>
    Does that hurt?</p>
  <p> He acknowledges. She treats it as Stubbs says to<br>
    Wesley--</p>
  <p> STUBBS<br>
    My mother's a formidable woman<br>
    too. A woman of letters.<br>
    (with many layers)<br>
    A great critic.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I know.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Evolution&quot; - REV. 7/25/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> STUBBS<br>
    Good Lord, son. You didn't read<br>
    that unauthorized biography too...<br>
    (off his acknowledgment)<br>
    I totally deny the story about<br>
    the consulate's wife on Beldoron.<br>
    We were only good friends. Is<br>
    that all the boy does, Doctor,<br>
    fly the ship and read? Doesn't<br>
    he have any fun?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Sure he does...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    My studies keep me pretty busy.<br>
    I'm trying to get into the<br>
    Academy... I earn credits for<br>
    my work on the Enterprise... but<br>
    it's not the same as being<br>
    there...</p>
  <p> Doctor Crusher finishes the treatment, nods to the<br>
    nurse.</p>
  <p> NURSE<br>
    Ready to sit up?</p>
  <p> Doctor Stubbs pulls himself up.</p>
  <p> STUBBS<br>
    I am whole again, thank you,<br>
    Doctor.<br>
    (he stands)<br>
    Come along, Wesley, let's make<br>
    sure Humpty Dumpty is still in<br>
    one piece.</p>
  <p> Beverly thinks about the conversation as Wes follows<br>
    Stubbs out. The doctor's attention is drawn to:</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We're analyzing the engineering<br>
    systems data, Captain... so far<br>
    nothing unusual in the computer<br>

    ... As well as the food slots in<br>
    Sickbay.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    Jean-Luc, how would you feel if<br>
    you were a seventeen year old and<br>
    the only starship officer whose<br>
    mother was on board... ?</p>
  <p> Picard takes a moment... he's less comfortable in<br>
    dealing with her on a personal level... but tries his<br>
    best.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you're concerned about Wesley,<br>
    I see no evidence that there's<br>
    a problem.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I know. In a funny kind of way...<br>
    that's exactly my point. We talk.<br>
    We smile. It's almost too<br>
    polite.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Beverly, this is simply a matter<br>
    of time. I know how difficult<br>
    it was to be away.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (vulnerable)<br>
    Tell me about him.</p>
  <p> A beat as Picard is somewhat nonplussed at how to<br>
    respond to a mother who wants to know her son.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He's... become a fine officer.<br>
    He works as hard as any member<br>
    of the crew... Riker says his<br>
    studies...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No, tell me about him.</p>
  <p> And this is way out of Picard's comfort zone.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He seems well adjusted...</p>

    fast. And since I've been back<br>
    I don't feel...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    His dependence?<br>
    (beat, as she considers)<br>
    He is seventeen, Beverly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What were you doing when you were<br>
    seventeen?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Getting into a lot more trouble<br>

    The fact of the matter is we're<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's hard to accept.</p>

    I run a clean place here.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I know. It's not that. I just...</p>
  <p> He's obviously in trouble... their eyes meet. He can't<br>
    lie to her. Can anyone?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Guinan, I'm scared. Everything<br>
    that's been going wrong may be<br>
    my fault.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Pull up a stool, Wesley.</p>
  <p> They sit.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I've been working on my final<br>
    project for Advanced Genetics.<br>
    It's on nanotechnology. And I've<br>
    been studying the nanites we have<br>
    in the Sickbay genetic supplies.<br>
    They're just like tiny little<br>
    robots with gigabytes of<br>
    mechanical computer memory, tiny<br>
    enough to enter living cells and<br>
    conduct repairs. They're supposed<br>
    to be strictly confined to the<br>
    lab.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Are you trying to say some nanites<br>
    are on the loose?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (sighs)<br>
    Two of them. That's all. See,<br>
    I just wanted to see how they<br>
    would interact and function in<br>
    tandem. In my project, I had<br>
    proposed a theory that they could<br>
    actually combine their skills to<br>
    improve their usefulness. And<br>
    it was working.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You made a better nanite.</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I was pulling an all-nighter to<br>
    get my final data... and I fell<br>
    asleep. When I woke up, I<br>
    realized the container was still<br>
    open...<br>
    (off her look)<br>
    It was just a science project.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    A doctor once said the very same<br>
    thing to me... what was his<br>
    name... Frankenstein, I think.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    They're really harmless. They<br>
    only have the most basic skills.<br>
    It's almost impossible that they<br>
    could be responsible...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Almost.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    I stopped by your quarters, Wes.<br>
    I assumed you'd be there, since<br>
    you're off duty.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I was just... I had some things<br>

  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Orders are orders, Mister Crusher.</p>
  <p> Wesley sighs, glances at Guinan.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You won't tell anybody...</p>
  <p> A beat as Guinan looks at him.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>

  <p> Everyone at their stations... Troi is also on the<br>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    We have even considered sabotage,<br>
    but Counselor Troi has not<br>
    detected any such sentiments.<br>
    We have engines back and will<br>
    attempt to complete our mission...<br>
    but without a reliable computer,<br>
    Doctor Stubbs' experiment is in<br>
    serious jeopardy.</p>
  <p> Stubbs watches this time with greater intensity.</p>

  <p> As he does,</p>

  <p> Suddenly over the loudspeakers, blasting music --<br>
    Sousa's &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;....</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What in heaven's name... ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;<br>
    by John Phillip Sousa, a popular<br>
    American composer of band music<br>
    in the early twentieth century...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes... yes... I know...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Computer, shut off the music....</p>
  <p> The music plays on.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The music is on all communications<br>

    Power... weapons...<br>
    communications. We're being<br>
    stripped one system at a time...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Shut off the power to the bridge.</p>
  <p> The music stops and the lights go out... after a beat,<br>
    emergency lighting comes on. Picard looks at Troi...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I feel no hostile emotions<br>
    present. No friendly feelings<br>
    either. Nothing.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not now, Doctor.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll try, Captain. I don't want<br>
    to overload the engines...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do it gently. But do it.</p>
  <p> Geordi EXITS. Doctor Stubbs does not even look at Picard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'll circuit in auxiliary power<br>
    to the bridge... and find some<br>
    way to silence Sousa if he tries<br>
    an encore.</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges, to Riker --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The priority is to find out who<br>
    or what is doing this and why.<br>

    Those of us not involved in that<br>

  <p> He EXITS. Wesley glances at Doctor Stubbs who looks away<br>
    and EXITS.</p>
  <p>54 INT. SHUTTLE BAY</p>
  <p> Stubbs stands with his egg in a stark shot of a man<br>
    considering the meaning of his life. Moving to find<br>
    Wesley entering behind him...</p>
  <p> STUBBS<br>
    The egg that Stubbs laid.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Nobody will say that...</p>
  <p> STUBBS<br>
    Nobody will say... anything,<br>
    Wesley. We will not even be<br>
    mentioned.</p>
  <p> Wesley can't speak, feeling guilty.</p>
  <p> STUBBS<br>
    (continuing; sighs)<br>
    I could live with failure.<br>
    ... Well, maybe not. But never<br>
    even to try. To miss your one<br>
    chance at bat. Do you know<br>
    baseball?</p>

    My dad taught it to me when I was<br>
    little.</p>
  <p> STUBBS<br>
    Once, centuries ago, it was the<br>
    beloved national pastime of the<br>
    Americas, Wesley. Abandoned by<br>
    a society that prized fast food<br>
    and faster games. Lost to<br>
    impatience. But I have seen the<br>
    great players make the great<br>
    plays.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Do you recreate them on a<br>
    Holodeck?</p>
  <p> STUBBS<br>
    No, in here...<br>
    (his mind)<br>
    With the knowledge of<br>
    statistics... runs, hits and<br>
    errors... times at bat... box<br>
    scores. Men like us do not need<br>
    Holodecks, Wesley. I have played<br>
    seasons in my mind. It was my<br>
    reward to myself. For patience.<br>
    Knowing my turn would come. Call<br>
    your shot. Point to a star. One<br>
    great blast and the crowd rises.<br>
    A brand new era in astro-physics.<br>
    Postponed one hundred and<br>
    ninety-six years on account of<br>
    rain.</p>
  <p>55 INT. SICKBAY LAB</p>
  <p> Wes has collected his traps. He's scanning a few with<br>
    no results... but then there's an audio response from<br>
    his scanner on one. Before he can make a visual<br>
    check, the door slides open and his mother ENTERS.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We have to talk.</p>
  <p> He glances up at her -- does she know? Did Guinan tell<br>
    her? She sits by him.</p>

    I know. It's okay. Really.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (gentle)<br>
    No, it's not. Really.</p>
  <p> She takes his hand, stops him from the work.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm just checking some traps that<br>
    I set... to see if I can find out<br>
    what's happening to the ship.</p>

    Mom, you don't understand...</p>

    I'm an acting officer... I have<br>
    responsibilities....</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (cautiously)<br>

    we're all expecting too much of<br>
    you.</p>

    here.</p>
  <p> That pretty well gets down to it. And Beverly<br>
    understands that conflicts come with being a real<br>
    parent... and is ready to resume that role.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm here now, Wesley.</p>
  <p> Wesley, like any normal teenager, does not seem to get<br>
    it at all, but somewhere deep inside, a part of him may<br>
    begin to feel her love and concern. This is not going<br>
    to be resolved soon.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    C'mon, I'll help you finish this<br>
    up... what are you looking for?</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's true. I'm reponsible. I<br>

  <p> Troi studies Doctor Stubbs carefully, is worried about<br>
    what she feels. And then she suddenly feels something<br>
    else... she isn't sure at first what it is...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor Stubbs, your own actions<br>
    have provided evidence to the<br>
    contrary. After you destroyed<br>
    the nanites in the core, they<br>
    immediately responded by<br>
    interfering with our life-support<br>

  <p> Worf nods to a GUARD who takes Stubbs by the arm and<br>
    escorts him out. Suddenly, the chaos ends. The ship<br>

    Your single-mindedness, your need<br>
    to have this experiment work...</p>
  <p> STUBBS<br>

    I pledge to you that we will<br>
    provide any assistance you need<br>
    for your continued survival.</p>
  <p> DATA/NANITE<br>
    Thank you, but we have evolved<br>
    beyond any need for your<br>
    assistance. This vessel has<br>
    become too confining. We require<br>
    relocation.</p>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43104.7.<br>
    Doctor Stubbs has generously used<br>
    his influence to arrange the<br>
    designation of planet Kavis-Alpha-Four<br>
    as the new home of the Nanite<br>
    Civilization. Plans to negotiate<br>
    a treaty are underway.<br>

  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    Commander Data's neural network<br>
    has been vacated... He has been<br>
    returned to us, unharmed, and with<br>
    the help of the nanites, our<br>
    computer core has been<br>
    reconstructed in time for the<br>
    experiment...</p>
  <p>93A INT. SHUTTLE BAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The unit is launched into space...</p>

  <p> All the main crew... Stubbs is at a back science<br>
    station. Data is Data again and at his post.</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    We're at forty million kilometers<br>
    from the neutron star.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hold your position.</p>
  <p> On the viewscreen, the neutron star explodes in a<br>
    dazzling fireworks show... swallowing the unit in<br>
    blinding light.</p>
  <p>95 STUBBS</p>
  <p> at Science One, completely enthralled in his work...<br>
    collecting data as it pours into the computer...</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor?</p>
  <p> Doctor Stubbs doesn't hear Picard or at least doesn't<br>
    acknowledge... we don't know if the experiment has been<br>
    successful or not... he is awash with numbers, facts<br>
    figures. Picard and Riker exchange a glance.</p>

  <p>96 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> But the last look is Wesley's who watches the doctor<br>
    alone in his own world, obsessed with the moment he's<br>
    given his life for.</p>

  <p> Beverly sits at the bar with Guinan.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Do you have any children, Guinan?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    A lot.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Ever have any trouble relating<br>
    to them?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Just one.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    One?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    He wouldn't listen.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well, they all go through that.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Not in a species of listeners.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Did he grow out of it?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Well, it's taken a few hundred<br>
    years or so but I've brought him<br>
    around.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    A mother shapes her child in ways<br>
    she doesn't even realize.<br>
    Sometimes just by listening.</p>
  <p> She motions Beverly to see --</p>

  <p> entering. Beverly exchanges a glance with Guinan,<br>
    pleased.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Cute couple.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Now, see, that's healthy for a<br>
    boy his age. I mean that as a<br>
    doctor not just a mother. It's<br>
    good to see him having fun... with<br>
    an attractive young woman... who<br>
    obviously looks at him with<br>
    extraordinary affection...</p>
  <p> Raised eyebrow...</p>

    What do you know about this girl?</p>
