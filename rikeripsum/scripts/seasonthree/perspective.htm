    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. HOLODECK/ART CLASS</p>
  <p> Open on side view of painting canvas. PICARD'S hand<br>
    comes into picture from o.s. with paintbrush and works<br>
    on the as-yet-unseen painting. PULL BACK to reveal<br>
    PICARD sitting in an art class along with TWO<br>
    SUPERNUMERARIES. They are all painting something that<br>
    is presently o.s.</p>
  <p>2 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> shows that the class is painting a NUDE FEMALE MODEL.</p>
  <p>3 ON HOLODECK DOORS</p>
  <p> The doors OPEN and DATA ENTERS. He walks over to<br>
    address Picard.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (sotto voce)<br>
    We have arrived at Tanuga Four,<br>
    Captain. The away team has<br>
    completed its survey of Doctor<br>
    Apgar's work and is ready to<br>
    return to the ship.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (putting aside<br>
    paintbrush)<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> Data is curious about Picard's artwork and is trying<br>
    to get a better look at it when Picard notices his<br>
    interest.</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    (gestures)<br>
    Please... and examine the work<br>
    of the other students as well.</p>
  <p> Data moves in front of all three paintings as the other<br>
    students move aside.</p>

  <p>4 DATA AT PICTURE #1</p>
  <p> Woman with flowers.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ensign Williams' striking style<br>
    is heavily influenced by geometric<br>
    constructivism.</p>
  <p> Moving to...</p>
  <p>4A DATA AT PICTURE #2</p>
  <p> Woman with violin.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Lieutenant Wright has effectively<br>
    fused the incongruities of the<br>
    surrealists with the irrationality<br>
    of Dadaism.</p>
  <p> Returning to...</p>
  <p>5 PICARD'S PAINTING</p>
  <p> Picard tries not to betray his feelings as Data<br>
    prepares to pronounce judgment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Interesting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How so?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    While suggesting the free<br>
    treatment of form usually<br>
    attributed to Fauvism, this quite<br>
    inappropriately attempts to<br>
    juxtapose the disparate cubistic<br>
    styles of Picasso and Leger. In<br>
    addition, the use of color<br>
    suggests a haphazard melange of<br>
    clashing styles.<br>

  <p> DATA (Cont'd)<br>
    Furthermore, the unsettling<br>
    overtones of proto-Vulcan<br>
    influences...</p>
  <p> Picard's features have become progressively clouded<br>
    during this speech and finally he's had enough.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (strained)<br>
    Thank you... Mister Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are welcome, sir. If I may<br>
    be of any further assistance --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No... thank you.</p>
  <p> Data turns and EXITS. Off Picards reaction...</p>
  <p>5A ALTERNATE</p>
  <p> Picard slowly walks toward his painting; picks up a<br>
    jar full of paint brushes, removes the brushes and<br>
    proceeds to throw the bright red liquid onto his<br>
    canvas.</p>

    Captain's log, Stardate 43610.4.<br>
    After completing a delivery of<br>
    dicosilium to the Tanuga Four<br>
    research station, our away team<br>
    is receiving an update from<br>
    Doctor Nel Apgar on his efforts<br>
    to create Krieger Waves, a<br>
    potentially valuable new power<br>
    source.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Perspective&quot; - REV. 11/28/89 - TEASER 3A.</p>
  <p>8 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard and Data ENTER from the turbolift. WORF at<br>
    Tactical. GEORDI is at an Aft Science Station going<br>
    over some information on the console. Data goes to<br>
    Ops.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Welcome back, Mister La Forge.<br>
    Where's Commander Riker?</p>
  <p> And Geordi answers evenly, but there is a trace of<br>
    tension in his voice...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Perspective&quot; - REV. 11/28/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Still on the station, sir. Doctor<br>
    Apgar wanted a word with him.</p>
  <p> Picard notices...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any problems... ?</p>
  <p> Hesitating, this is really something Riker should tell<br>
    Picard about...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not... with the scientific part<br>
    of the mission, sir...</p>
  <p> Picard's curiosity is raised even further by Geordi's<br>
    evasiveness, but before he can pursue it, Riker's voice<br>
    breaks in over the com line.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    (a little stiffly)<br>
    Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready<br>
    to leave now.</p>
  <p> Saved by the bell... to Picard's unspoken question --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm sure Commander Riker will<br>
    explain, sir...</p>
  <p> What is going on, wonders Picard. As...</p>

  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Stand by, Commander. Engaging<br>
    transport.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN energizes the transporter console. Nothing<br>
    happens. O'Brien frowns at his console:</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (to com panel)<br>
    Transporter Room to Engineering.<br>
    I have a power drain...</p>

  <p>9A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Near the space station... which suddenly EXPLODES.</p>
  <p>10 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ON PICARD AND MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAAL)</p>
  <p> Picard is moving toward the command center. In the<br>
    b.g. the aftermath of the explosion is clearly visible<br>
    on the Main Viewer. Data at Ops. Supernumerary at<br>
    Conn.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (urgently)<br>
    Transporter Room! Is Commander<br>
    Riker aboard?</p>
  <p>11 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> O'Brien working furiously at the console.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Not yet, Captain. I'm having<br>
    trouble clearing the signal...</p>
  <p> He continues to fight to bring Riker aboard. On the<br>
    transporter pad, the TRANSPORTER EFFECT shimmers,<br>
    weakens, shimmers again... finally RIKER begins to take<br>
    shape. The EFFECT ENDS and Riker steps off the pad.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN (cont'd)<br>
    Transporter Room to bridge. He's<br>
    aboard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You sound surprised, Mister<br>
    O'Brien...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    For a moment, we weren't sure you<br>
    left the space station in time...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    In time for what... ?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    It just exploded, sir.</p>
  <p> On Riker's reaction --</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>12 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is in orbit as before. The space station is<br>
    gone, but perhaps there is a faint cloud of particles<br>
    or debris left over from the explosion seen earlier.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental:<br>
    Commander Riker has informed me<br>
    that Doctor Apgar was the only<br>
    one aboard the space station when<br>
    it exploded. We remain in orbit<br>
    investigating the accident...</p>
  <p>13 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Geordi... WESLEY is at Conn, Worf at<br>
    Tactical, Data at Ops...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE<br>
    I've gone through the whole<br>
    system, sir... I can't find any<br>
    malfunction in the transporter,<br>
    nothing that would cause an<br>
    explosion like that...</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>13A INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Why was there a power drain before<br>
    transport?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I don't know, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    I want an answer to that<br>
    question... I'm sure the Tanugans<br>
    will too...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Yessir.</p>
  <p> END INTERCUT:</p>

  <p>13B INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, the radiation and debris<br>
    are consistent with an overload<br>
    of the station's reactor core.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Perspective&quot; - REV. 11/29/89 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>13B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Riker and Geordi...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any indications of reactor core<br>
    problems while you were on the<br>
    station?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker's brow is wrinkled... his mind is not in the<br>
    room. Picard notices...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One... ?</p>
  <p> Riker looks up, shakes his head, no.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Commander La Forge suggested this<br>
    was not an entirely routine<br>
    mission...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (sighs)<br>
    It's a long story, Captain...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    ... but I'm sure it doesn't have<br>
    anything to do with this accident.</p>
  <p> His voice sounds uncertain.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, Chief Investigator Krag<br>
    of the Tanugan security force<br>
    requests permission to beam<br>
    aboard.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts, stares at Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Granted, Lieutenant, please escort<br>
    our guest to the bridge.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    ...slowly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf EXITS...</p>

  <p>13B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Perhaps you should tell me as much<br>
    as possible prior to his arrival,<br>
    Number One.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Perspective&quot; - REV. 11/28/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>

  <p>17A INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As Inspector Krag MATERIALIZES. His curious eyes<br>
    examine his surroundings, study the Klingon who greets<br>
    him, and O'Brien behind the console.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am Lieutenant Worf, head of<br>
    ship's security. I will take you<br>
    to the captain.</p>
  <p> Krag nods and follows; he could be intimidated here,<br>
    away from his usual turf, but he isn't...</p>
  <p>18 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As before. Worf ENTERS from the turbolift along with<br>
    Krag. Geordi is at the science station. Data and<br>
    Wesley are at their accustomed stations. Krag is at<br>
    all times soft-spoken, calm, rather British in nature<br>
    (no accent)... qualities of the men of his race... but<br>
    also fine qualities for an investigator. He is also<br>
    quite relentless and determined to get to the truth.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Chief Investigator, welcome to<br>
    the Enterprise. I'm Captain<br>
    Picard... my first officer,<br>
    Commander William Riker.</p>
  <p> Krag all but ignores Picard at the mention of Riker's<br>
    name.</p>
  <p> KRAG<br>
    Commander Riker, I am here to take<br>
    you into custody...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    On what charge?</p>
  <p> KRAG<br>
    Suspicion of murder.</p>
  <p> All over the bridge, heads turn in shock.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Perspective&quot; - REV. 11/29/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    Murder... now wait a minute...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Chief Investigator... we are more<br>
    than willing to cooperate fully<br>
    with you, but...</p>
  <p> KRAG<br>
    Then you will release the prisoner<br>
    for transportation to the planet.</p>
  <p> Picard holds up a hand: &quot;just wait a second&quot;, realizes<br>
    the bridge is no place to have this discussion...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Krag)<br>
    Why don't we discuss this in<br>
    private...</p>
  <p> Indicating the way... Riker moves to join them, but<br>
    Picard, as his captain, looks him back with purpose...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You have the bridge, Number One.</p>
  <p> Riker is about to protest, but instead says nothing<br>
    and remains on the bridge as Picard and Krag EXIT into<br>
    the Ready Room. The rest of the bridge crew can't help<br>
    but steal glances at Riker.</p>
  <p>19 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard indicates a chair for Krag as he seats himself<br>
    at the desk. Krag remains standing and is waiting for<br>
    Picard to make the first move.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Just what is your evidence against<br>
    my officer?</p>
  <p> KRAG<br>
    Two witnesses have come forward<br>
    to describe Commander Riker's<br>
    threats against Doctor Apgar...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Perspective&quot; - REV. 11/28/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Threats... ? I am aware of an<br>
    altercation between the two of<br>
    them...</p>
  <p> KRAG<br>
    It apparently was much more than<br>
    just an altercation, Captain...<br>
    but he will have a chance to prove<br>
    his innocence...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In our system of legal<br>
    jurisprudence, a man is innocent<br>
    until proved guilty.</p>
  <p> KRAG<br>
    In ours, he is guilty until he<br>
    is proved innocent. And you are<br>
    in our jurisdiction. If I<br>
    understand the Federation<br>
    regulations on these matters, and<br>
    I just happened to look them up<br>
    before I...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    I'm aware of the Federation<br>
    regulations, sir... and if you<br>
    will check further, they say the<br>
    captain will decide if extradition<br>
    is warranted...</p>
  <p> KRAG<br>
    Are you saying it is not?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm saying...</p>
  <p> ... backing off the conflict, knowing it does not help<br>
    matters.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    If I find that there is sufficient<br>
    cause to warrant a trial, I<br>
    will... release Commander Riker<br>
    to your custody.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Perspective&quot; - REV. 11/28/89 - ACT ONE 10A.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> KRAG<br>
    (thoughtful beat)<br>
    Would you say you're close to your<br>
    first officer, Captain?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Perspective&quot; - REV. 11/29/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's irrelevant here...</p>
  <p> KRAG<br>
    Really, Captain, you cannot<br>
    believe that. And how can I<br>
    expect a fair and impartial<br>
    decision?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will protect the rights of my<br>
    officer...</p>
  <p> KRAG<br>
    I appreciate that. But you'll<br>
    have to do it on the planet, not<br>
    here. After all, what if you were<br>
    suddenly to decide to leave this<br>

    You have my word as an officer<br>
    of Starfleet that I will not.</p>
  <p> KRAG<br>
    Unacceptable. You must turn him<br>
    over to me for interrogation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Interrogate him here.</p>
  <p> KRAG<br>
    Captain, we must recreate<br>
    step-by-step, moment-by-moment,<br>
    the events leading to the<br>
    explosion... we need immediate<br>
    access to all the witnesses, as<br>
    well as the data from the lab's<br>
    ground computers. It would be<br>
    impossible to accomplish here.</p>
  <p> A beat. Looking for a compromise --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps not.<br>
    (keys insignia)<br>
    Mister Data, please report to my<br>
    Ready Room.<br>
    (to Krag)<br>
    In fact, I may be able to assist<br>
    you in recreating the events.</p>

    Commander Data, Chief Inspector<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, by taking testimony from<br>
    both the away team and from<br>
    witnesses provided by Investigator<br>
    Krag, would it be possible to<br>
    program the Holodeck to recreate<br>
    what happened aboard the science<br>
    station?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It would require construction and<br>
    design specifications, full<br>
    orthographic representations of<br>
    the Krieger equipment, as well<br>
    as visual representations and<br>
    voice analyses of the persons<br>
    involved... but yes, it is<br>
    possible.</p>
  <p> Krag considers this. Picard is clearly unmovable on<br>
    releasing Riker. He nods.</p>
  <p> KRAG<br>
    Very well. Arrangements will be<br>
    made to provide you with all<br>
    available information. I shall<br>
    return shortly with our witnesses.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, escort the chief inspector<br>
    to Transporter Room Three.</p>
  <p> As they EXIT, stay on Picard a beat, see his frown as<br>
    he considers the situation...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Perspective&quot; - REV. 11/27/89 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>20 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As before. Riker is sitting in command and trying not<br>
    to throw glances at the Ready Room door. Picard ENTERS<br>
    from the Ready Room. TROI is now on the bridge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge, Ensign Crusher,<br>
    we are going to recreate the<br>
    research station on the Holodeck.<br>
    I want you to work with Mister<br>
    Data on the preparations. In<br>
    addition, Mister La Forge, you<br>
    and Commander Riker will give the<br>
    computer detailed depositions on<br>
    everything you heard and saw while<br>
    aboard. Counselor, you will<br>
    assist me during this inquiry.</p>
  <p> Picard pauses for a second as he considers the impact<br>
    of his next words on his trusted first officer.</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    (quiet yet firm)<br>
    My decision on extradition will<br>
    be based upon the evidence<br>
    presented in these re-creations.</p>
  <p> Riker can't really believe all this is happening, but<br>
    Picard's expression is set.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, may I have a word with<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Under these circumstances, I<br>
    believe it would be inappropriate,<br>
    Number One.</p>
  <p> Picard exits. PUSH IN on Riker's reaction...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT ONE</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Perspective&quot; - REV. 12/3/89 - ACT TWO 14-14A. </p>
  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>20A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As before.</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    Second officer's log, Stardate<br>
    43611.6. Programming of the<br>
    Holodeck has taken eighteen hours<br>
    and is now complete.</p>
  <p>21 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as Picard, Riker, Troi, and Krag approach the Holodeck<br>
    doors.</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    All participants have entered<br>
    their depositions. Technical<br>
    schematics, and complete records<br>
    from the lab's ground computers,<br>
    as well as Doctor Apgar's personal<br>
    logs, have been included. The<br>
    recreation has a nominal<br>
    eight-point-seven percent margin<br>
    of error.</p>
  <p> The participants ENTER the Holodeck.</p>
  <p>22 INT. HOLODECK/SPACE STATION LABORATORY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> This is the main laboratory of the space station. The<br>
    walls are lined with consoles, readouts, and computer<br>
    equipment, most of which is inactive at the moment.<br>
    Dominating the room is a large array of energy-focusing<br>
    condensers, field coils, refractors, and so forth.<br>
    Nearby is a medium-sized power reactor.</p>
  <p> Picard and Krag step into the center of the simulation.<br>
    Picard nods approval. Even the normally poker-faced<br>
    Krag is impressed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Perspective&quot; - REV. 12/3/89 - ACT TWO 15.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there anything you'd like to<br>
    say before we begin, Number One?</p>
  <p> To Krag --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Just this. I'm not a murderer.<br>
    I went to the Tanugan lab as an<br>
    official representative of<br>
    Starfleet. And I acted<br>
    accordingly. I was there to<br>
    evaluate Apgar's progress on<br>
    development of a Krieger Wave<br>
    converter. That's all I was<br>
    interested in. Computer. Load<br>
    deposition program, Riker One.</p>
  <p>23 ANGLE ON THE LAB (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The holograms of APGAR and TAYNA APPEAR, frozen in<br>
    position.</p>
  <p> Apgar is male, older than Riker, cold, intelligent,<br>
    antisocial... and like Krag, he is soft-spoken,<br>
    reserved. Tayna is female, early twenties, the<br>
    deferential assistant.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Run the simulation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Perspective&quot; - REV. 12/3/89 - ACT TWO 16.</p>
  <p>24 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Apgar and Tayna holograms &quot;come to life&quot; just as<br>
    (holograms of) Geordi, and Riker MATERIALIZE in the lab<br>
    (the away team beaming onto the station). (It's<br>
    important to note that in Riker's presentation of the<br>
    story, he is extremely business-like, almost flat in<br>
    character... he is not as charming or personable as<br>
    we know he can be. Nevertheless, for him, this is the<br>
    truth.)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Doctor Apgar? I'm Commander<br>
    William Riker; Lieutenant<br>
    Commander Geordi La Forge.</p>
  <p> Apgar's making an effort to be polite, but he's plainly<br>
    less than overjoyed to see them. And impatient to get<br>
    it over with.</p>
  <p> APGAR<br>
    My assistant Tayna... well, let's<br>
    get on with it, shall we?</p>
  <p> From off camera, heads turning to the voice of --</p>
  <p> MANUA (O.S.)<br>
    Don't be in such a hurry, dear...</p>
  <p>24A ANGLE - MANUA</p>
  <p> entering... and it's a moment... like that first look<br>
    that Bacall gave Bogart in &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot;, she<br>
    gives that look to Riker... female, thirties, strong,<br>
    outgoing -- she takes your breath away. But Riker's<br>
    hologram is quite unmoved.</p>
  <p> MANUA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Perhaps our guests would like some<br>
    refreshment...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Perspective&quot; - REV. 12/3/89 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>24A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She moves to Riker, looks him in the eyes...</p>
  <p> APGAR<br>
    My wife, Manua...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (pleasant but routine)<br>
    Pleasure to meet you, Mrs.<br>
    Apgar.</p>
  <p> His attention is on Apgar...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Doctor, if you're prepared to get<br>
    started, so are we...</p>
  <p> APGAR<br>
    (defensive)<br>
    Prepared? Of course I'm<br>
    prepared...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    All right... then why don't you<br>
    give me the overview of your<br>
    research while Mister La Forge<br>
    and your assistant look at the<br>
    experimental data...</p>
  <p> APGAR<br>
    Fine. Whatever. I must say,<br>
    Commander, I resent your early<br>
    arrival. Starfleet will get its<br>
    converter... I've had a few<br>
    setbacks, that's all...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Perspective&quot; - REV. 12/4/89 - ACT TWO 17A.</p>
  <p>24A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (sympathetic)<br>
    Doctor, we're not here to pressure<br>
    you, we just want an update on<br>
    your progress.</p>
  <p> Apgar grunts, disbelieving. Riker glances toward --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Perspective&quot; - REV. 12/3/89 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>24B ANGLE - MANUA</p>
  <p> revealing she is bored beyond description, leaning<br>
    languidly against a counter with her elbows back,<br>
    supporting her and her chest thrust out rather<br>
    invitingly, her eyes undress Riker.</p>
  <p> APGAR<br>
    Tayna -- show the commander's<br>
    assistant whatever he wants to<br>
    see. Give him full access to our<br>
    records.</p>
  <p> TAYNA<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    If you'll come with me...</p>
  <p> Tayna leads Geordi over to the other side of the lab,<br>
    shows him the large array of condensers.</p>
  <p> TAYNA<br>
    Our Lambda Field generator is on<br>
    the planet since it requires a<br>
    minimum of five thousand kilometers<br>
    for the field to collimate.</p>
  <p> ... And out of earshot.</p>
  <p>25 ON MANUA</p>
  <p> turning to Riker and smiling warmly.</p>
  <p> MANUA<br>
    (to her husband)<br>
    Really, darling, you're being<br>
    rude... after all, Commander Riker<br>
    is willing to sit through all your<br>
    prattle about Krieger Waves...</p>
  <p> Apgar bristles at his wife's digs... she takes Riker's<br>
    arm... and Riker is embarrassed for Apgar, but it would<br>
    be extraordinarily awkward for him to throw down her<br>
    arm now that she has it...</p>
  <p> MANUA<br>
    Commander, let me get you a<br>
    drink... and we'll hear all about<br>
    Krieger Waves...</p>
  <p> And Riker is clearly uncomfortable as she leads him<br>
    to another room... Apgar follows as they exit.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Perspective&quot; - REV. 11/30/89 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>26 INT. HOLODECK/SPACE STATION LIVING AREA</p>
  <p> CLOSE on champagne being poured into three flutes.<br>
    WIDEN to reveal Manua doing the pouring. Riker and<br>
    Apgar are seated. Manua hands a glass to Riker; as<br>
    Riker takes it, their hands touch. Manua smiles.<br>
    Almost as an afterthought, she hands Apgar his glass.</p>
  <p> Riker raises his glass in a friendly toast:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    To your success, Doctor.</p>
  <p> MANUA<br>
    (pointed)<br>
    ... and the rewards that come<br>
    with it.</p>
  <p> Apgar scowls, makes a point of not joining in their<br>
    toast. Apgar gets down to business, states his<br>
    grievances:</p>
  <p> APGAR<br>
    Riker -- what is Starfleet doing<br>
    here anyway? My delivery wasn't<br>
    scheduled for another three<br>
    months.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Actually, we're in this sector<br>
    on another mission... and you had<br>
    asked Starfleet for additional<br>
    dicosilium.... it seemed like a<br>
    good opportunity.</p>
  <p> MANUA<br>
    How interesting. Tell us about<br>
    this other mission.</p>
  <p> As though she's interested in anything other than her<br>
    husband's work.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's just a study of a proto-star<br>
    cloud. The Enterprise will be<br>
    returning tomorrow.</p>
  <p> APGAR<br>
    (even less pleased)<br>
    The Enterprise just left you here?</p>
  <p> Riker can't understand why Apgar has such a negative<br>
    attitude. He tries to placate Apgar:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Perspective&quot; - REV. 12/1/89 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We have no wish to inconvenience<br>
    you. We've arranged for quarters<br>
    on the planet...</p>
  <p> MANUA<br>
    (smoothly)<br>
    I won't hear of such a thing.<br>
    Commander, I insist you and Mister<br>
    La Forge stay with us.</p>
  <p> Again the inviting smile from Manua. Apgar protests:</p>
  <p> APGAR<br>
    I hardly think --</p>
  <p> MANUA<br>
    (to Apgar, firm)<br>
    I know you'd prefer to be alone<br>
    with your important work... but<br>
    I, for one, am glad for the<br>
    company.</p>
  <p> Apgar sullenly clams up. Manua beams at Riker.</p>
  <p> MANUA<br>
    Good.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    I must apologize for my husband's<br>
    lack of social graces. He may<br>
    be one of the great scientific<br>
    minds in the galaxy... but he<br>
    does come up a bit short in other<br>
    areas.</p>
  <p> Riker doesn't know what to say to that, takes a sip<br>
    of champagne.</p>

    definite feminine touch.</p>
  <p> MANUA<br>
    Our guest quarters aren't<br>
    luxurious... but I've tried to<br>
    make this room warm... and<br>
    inviting.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll be very comfortable, thank<br>
    you. Good night.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's late. And I'm tired.</p>

  <p> KRAG<br>
    That's very odd, Commander. Very<br>
    odd. Captain Picard, isn't it<br>
    true that your sensors picked up<br>
    a power drain just before<br>
    transport?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That is correct.</p>
  <p> KRAG<br>
    Have you been able to explain it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not to my knowledge.</p>
  <p> KRAG<br>
    (nods)<br>
    We have. Our readings are quite<br>
    clear about it. Information<br>
    retrieved from the lab's ground<br>
    computers show that a focused<br>
    energy pulse was fired just as<br>
    Commander Riker began transport.<br>
    Furthermore, by analyzing the<br>
    trajectory and angle, it is clear<br>
    that it came from the very spot<br>
    that Commander Riker was standing.<br>
    In short, allow me to show you<br>

  <p> MANUA<br>
    I never said that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nevertheless, it seems clear that<br>
    your husband was motivated to earn<br>
    the kind of rewards that would<br>
    please you, Mrs. Apgar.</p>
  <p> MANUA<br>
    (defensive)<br>
    What's wrong with that?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He wouldn't have earned great<br>
    profits from his dealings with<br>
    Starfleet... We were only<br>
    interested in a new power<br>
    source...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But if he could turn this into<br>
    a weapon... it would be worth a<br>
    lot to the Ferengi or the<br>
    Romulans or a few others. Doctor<br>
    Apgar had been ordering extra<br>
    dicosilium for months... that's<br>
    a pretty good indication he was<br>
    trying to create larger reflective<br>
    coils.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    When the away team arrived early<br>
    he must have been worried that<br>
    Starfleet was getting suspicious.<br>
    He needed more time to finish his<br>
    work. Apgar said that in all<br>
    three versions. No doubt, he was<br>
    afraid that Commander Riker might<br>
    learn the truth and cut off his<br>
    support prematurely.<br>

  <p> APGAR<br>
    What are you going to put in your<br>
    report, Riker? That there's no<br>
    justification for all the extra<br>
    discosilium I've requested? That<br>
    is why they sent you early, isn't<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> APGAR<br>

    I can explain why I needed it.<br>
    They have no idea what my problems<br>
    are... there are explanations for<br>
    all of it...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    I don't need explanations.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Perspective&quot; - REV. 12/3/89 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>

  <p> A moment as they study each other. Apgar seems to<br>
    understand where he stands now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Freeze.</p>
  <p> The holograms freeze.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    To Apgar, that must have seemed<br>
    as though Commander Riker was<br>
    confirming his worst fears. And I<br>
    believe this is when Apgar decided<br>
    finally to kill him.</p>
  <p> KRAG<br>
    You forget, Picard... we know the<br>
    energy pulse which blew up the<br>
    reactor was fired from Commander<br>
    Riker's position not Doctor<br>
    Apgar's.</p>
  <p> Picard glances to Geordi.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We are hypothesizing that Doctor<br>
    Apgar energized the converter at<br>
    the moment of Commander Riker's<br>
    beam-out hoping to make his death<br>
    look like a transporter accident.<br>
    But something went wrong... the<br>
    energy pulse hit the Transporter<br>
    beam and reflected back to the<br>
    lab's reactor which caused the<br>
    explosion.</p>
  <p> KRAG<br>
    An interesting hypothesis. But<br>
    impossible to prove.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not really. We know that the<br>
    field generator on the planet<br>
    has been repeating a discharge<br>
    command ever since the explosion.<br>

  <p> GEORDI (Cont'd)<br>
    The intervals are like<br>
    clockwork... except the explosion<br>
    occurred point-zero-zero-one-four<br>
    seconds after the first<br>
    discharge... the only explanation<br>
    for that variance is the time it<br>
    would take the energy pulse to<br>
    bounce back from the transporter<br>
    beam to the reactor.</p>
  <p> MANUA<br>
    I haven't the slightest idea what<br>
    anyone's talking about.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nor should you, Mrs. Apgar.<br>
    We have arranged a demonstration<br>
    to illustrate. Mister La Forge,<br>
    I believe it is almost time is<br>
    it not?</p>

    The next discharge from the field<br>
    generator is scheduled to occur<br>
    in a few moments. We have aligned<br>
    the Holodeck program to recreate<br>
    the final events as Commander<br>
    Riker described them... only this<br>
    time our facsimile will<br>
    automatically process the energy<br>
    charge from the planet and reflect<br>
    it just as the original convertor<br>
    did before the explosion.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If we're correct, we'll know it<br>
    instantly.</p>

    Stand by, Commander. Engaging<br>

  <p> Riker begins to DEMATERIALIZE... Apgar glances up...<br>
    suddenly an energy beam shoots from the converter hits<br>
    the transport effect and reflects back past Apgar into<br>
    the reactor... and then there is a huge explosion that<br>
    wipes out everything except of course the gallery...<br>
    when it clears, we are in:</p>
  <p>75 INT. HOLODECK</p>

    Doctor Apgar killed himself...<br>

    Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> A long beat.</p>

  <p>76 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker at their command stations. Everyone<br>
    else in their usual positions. Troi is ENTERING from<br>
    the aft turbolift. As she walks down to her chair she<br>
    takes the long way so she can pass by Riker, and lay a<br>
    hand briefly on his shoulder.</p>
  <p> He looks up at her, and a glance is exchanged. &quot;I'm<br>
    glad you're safe.&quot; &quot;I'm glad you were there.&quot;</p>
  <p> She takes her chair.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, Number One... have we any<br>
    &quot;further business&quot; in the Tanuga<br>
    system?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not that I know of, sir. I'm more<br>
    than willing to put it behind me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then perhaps you'd be so good as<br>
    to get this ship underway?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    With pleasure, sir.</p>
  <p> They exchange a glance. Riker then turns toward<br>
    Wesley.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Crusher, set a course for<br>
