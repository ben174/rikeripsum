    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around a bright green planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 43980.7.<br>
    The Enterprise has been in<br>
    attendance at the biennial Trade<br>
    Agreements Conference on Betazed.</p>
  <p>2 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> A busy place. Conference delegates from different<br>
    worlds are here, including three Ferengi: TOG, FAREK,<br>
    and NIBOR. In b.g., a MUSICIAN entertains the<br>
    gathering, playing a complex RHYTHM on a strange<br>
    percussion instrument. RIKER plays three-dimensional<br>
    chess with Nibor as WESLEY looks on. PICARD, TROI, and<br>
    DATA socialize with their guests as Log is completed:</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    For the first time, the Ferengi<br>
    are present, and I have<br>
    reluctantly consented to their<br>
    boarding the Enterprise for the<br>
    closing reception.</p>
  <p>2A ANGLE ON RIKER AND NIBOR</p>
  <p> It is clear they are near the end of their game, and<br>
    the Ferengi is in trouble. Captured pieces litter the<br>
    table at Riker's elbow.</p>
  <p> Nibor makes a move, he is confident. Riker smiles,<br>
    moves his piece.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Check... and mate.</p>
  <p> Nibor falls back flabbergasted in his chair. Wesley is<br>
    enjoying the moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/19/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Perfect. A queen's gambit...<br>
    finished off with the Aldabren<br>
    Exchange.</p>
  <p> The Ferengi is still stunned by his defeat.</p>
  <p> NIBOR<br>
    (re: the musician)<br>
    Unfair. I couldn't concentrate<br>
    with all that noise...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's Algolian ceremonial rhythms.</p>
  <p> Riker and Wesley nod. Nibor shakes his head.</p>
  <p> NIBOR<br>
    Hyoo-mans...</p>
  <p>2B ANGLE ON PICARD AND DATA</p>
  <p> talking with REITTAN GRAX, the Betazoid conference<br>
    director.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (lifting glass)<br>
    A toast to the success of the<br>
    trade conference, Reittan. I must<br>
    admit, I had some doubts when you<br>
    invited the Ferengi.</p>
  <p> REITTAN GRAX<br>
    They made a profit and behaved<br>
    themselves. What more could one<br>
    ask? Still, they trouble me. We<br>
    Betazeds are uncomfortable with<br>
    species like the Ferengi... whose<br>
    minds we can't read.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (ever the scientist)<br>
    Perhaps your telepathic abilities<br>
    are ineffective owing to the<br>
    anomalous construction of the<br>
    Ferengi brain, which is composed<br>
    of four different...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/13/90 - TEASER 2A.</p>
  <p>2B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (not now, Data)<br>
    Thank you, Data.<br>
    (to Reittan Grax)<br>
    It was thoughtful of you to<br>
    include Lwaxana Troi as part of<br>
    the Betazed delegation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/19/90 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> REITTAN GRAX<br>
    Her first husband and I were old<br>
    friends. And I've known Deanna<br>
    since she was a child.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure Counselor Troi<br>
    appreciates this opportunity to<br>
    spend time with her mother.</p>
  <p>3 ANGLE ON TROI AND LWAXANA</p>
  <p> Lwaxana's plate is piled with food, her synthehol glass<br>
    is refilled continually as she gives new meaning to<br>
    the old Auntie Mame adage, &quot;Life is a banquet.&quot; Between<br>
    bites and sips, she plies her daughter with thought<br>
    transmissions.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (TELEPATHIC V.O.)<br>
    It's so marvelous to see you,<br>
    Deanna, darling.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    At least pretend you're happy to<br>
    see me.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (aloud)<br>
    Mother, we're among non-telepaths...<br>
    it's impolite not<br>
    to speak aloud.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (TELEPATHIC V.O.)<br>
    You mean talk with my mouth full?<br>
    Deanna, please!</p>
  <p> She does manage to laugh with her mouth full, but<br>
    Deanna doesn't think it's especially funny.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (aloud)<br>
    All right, I will say something<br>
    aloud. Have you considered if<br>
    you had stayed on Betazed just<br>
    where your life might have...</p>
  <p> They've had this conversation before.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/19/90 - TEASER 3A.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Let's not guess what I might have<br>
    done. I love my work aboard the<br>
    Enterprise...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/19/90 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    I know. But all business and no<br>
    play? You should enjoy life more,<br>
    like I do. Find the right man,<br>
    think of your future. Think of<br>
    my future...</p>
  <p> Interrupted by Riker; his timing couldn't be better.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Deanna, Lwaxana. Anything I can<br>
    do for you?</p>
  <p> Troi throws her mother a look. Don't answer that!</p>
  <p>4 ANGLE ON BAR</p>
  <p> as the other two Ferengi watch Mrs. Troi. Daimon Tog,<br>
    the Captain, seems fascinated by this Betazoid female.<br>
    Tog is tall for a Ferengi, although not by human<br>
    standards, and Ferengi women probably find him as close<br>
    to a &quot;hunk&quot; as their men ever get. He's talking with<br>
    his companion and ship's doctor, Farek. In b.g.,<br>
    Lwaxana LAUGHS. Farek winces at the sound.</p>
  <p> FAREK<br>
    (re: Lwaxana)<br>
    She is as repulsive as the rest<br>
    of them.</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    Repulsive? I find her exotic!<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    And what an advantage their<br>
    telepathy would be in<br>
    negotiations...</p>
  <p> FAREK<br>
    To read our competitors' minds...<br>
    yes, that would be valuable.</p>
  <p> Tog can't take his eyes off Lwaxana. Farek notices,<br>
    gives Tog a look -- &quot;be serious.&quot;</p>
  <p> FAREK (cont'd)<br>
    She'd never agree to use her<br>
    powers to help us...</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    I'm not so sure.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/19/90 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> In b.g., Riker and Troi move on. This is the moment<br>
    Tog's been waiting for. He moves quickly off.</p>
  <p>5 ANGLE ON TOG AND LWAXANA</p>
  <p> as he seats himself at her table.</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    Lwaxana Troi of Betazed, I<br>
    believe.<br>
    (with pride)<br>
    I am Daimon Tog of the Ferengi<br>
    vessel Krayton. May I join you?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (coolly)<br>
    I was just going to see Captain<br>
    Picard. Excuse me.</p>
  <p> She rises, maneuvering past Tog to where Picard is<br>
    still conversing with Data and Reittan Grax. She<br>
    interrupts:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Jean-Luc! Come have a drink and<br>
    tell me what you've been up to.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (thinking fast)<br>
    Uh... perhaps later, Lwaxana.<br>
    Data and I were just about to show<br>
    Reittan Grax the new door<br>
    mechanisms on the aft Turbolifts.<br>
    Would you excuse us?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/20/90 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> And off they go, leaving Lwaxana standing alone in the<br>
    middle of Ten Forward. And, oh God, here comes that<br>
    nasty little Ferengi again... oops, too late.</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    Lwaxana Troi, I desire you.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Wha... what?</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    Your Betazed skills would be very<br>
    useful to me... and I find you<br>
    attractive. I'm willing to pay<br>
    handsomely for you.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (growing angrier)<br>
    I don't believe this...</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    You must be aware that every<br>
    female has her price.</p>
  <p> Lwaxana is now infuriated. Almost without realizing<br>
    it, her voice will rise during the next speech until<br>
    all other activity in Ten Forward comes to a halt as<br>
    everyone's attention focuses on her:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Let's get one thing straight. I<br>
    am not for sale. And I'd rather<br>
    eat Orion wing-slugs than deal<br>
    with a toad-faced troll like you.<br>
    Go find someone else to become<br>
    your property.</p>
  <p>6 WIDER ANGLE</p>
  <p> to include a horrified Deanna. There is a pause as<br>
    everyone waits to see what Tog will do. He is silent<br>
    for a moment, then:</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    (oddly reserved)<br>
    As you wish.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/19/90 - TEASER 6A.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> As everyone else resumes their activities, Tog<br>
    retreats to the bar where Farek is tossing down another<br>
    synthehol.</p>
  <p> FAREK<br>
    Now that you've totally humiliated<br>
    us, may we return to our vessel?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/19/90 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    (ignoring him)<br>
    She's exhilarating, isn't she?</p>
  <p> Farek gives him a look. Is he kidding?</p>
  <p> TOG (cont'd)<br>
    Now I want her more than ever.<br>
    Lwaxana Troi will be mine.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>7 OMITTED</p>
  <p>8 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR - PERSONAL QUARTERS</p>
  <p> On the way to her cabin, Troi encounters WORF. They<br>
    walk together as Deanna continues to her quarters.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    Are we at war with the Ferengi<br>
    yet?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Daimon Tog has returned to his<br>
    vessel and the Ferengi have left<br>
    orbit.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm sure Mother will be relieved.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I hear she handled the situation<br>
    quite skillfully. An admirable<br>
    woman.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'll be sure to tell her you said<br>
    so.</p>
  <p> Worf leaves Deanna at her door, continues on his way.<br>
    Before her door opens, she hears a voice in her head:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (TELEPATHIC V.O.)<br>
    Come in, Little One.</p>
  <p> Troi reacts and enters.</p>
  <p>9 INT. TROI'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Lwaxana lies with her eyes open as if unseeing.<br>
    Unusual Betazed candles burn at each side of her head.<br>
    The room lighting adds to the effect of her appearing<br>
    dead, but actually she's in a meditative state.<br>
    Betazed is visible through the window.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/20/90 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother.<br>
    (more firmly)<br>
    Mother, please.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (TELEPATHIC V.O.)<br>
    Just a moment, Little One. I'm<br>
    at one with All Being.</p>
  <p> Troi is silent for a beat, then Lwaxana's eyes flutter,<br>
    and she returns to her familiar feisty self.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    After that horrible little Ferengi<br>
    insulted me, I needed to center<br>
    myself.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Can you imagine that creature<br>
    talking to me like that? Didn't<br>
    he realize I am the Daughter of<br>
    the Fifth House of Betazed, keeper<br>
    of the Chalice of Rixx?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother, the Chalice of Rixx is<br>
    an old clay pot with mold growing<br>
    inside it!</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    My dear, when you become old<br>
    enough and wise enough, you'll<br>
    understand. Now sit down and<br>
    talk to me. We don't spend enough<br>
    time together.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (sincerely)<br>
    That's true. I'm sorry, and I<br>
    didn't mean to be upset with you<br>
    at the reception.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Deanna... you must understand,<br>
    you're all I've got. My only<br>
    concern is for your happiness.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (a tad irritated)<br>
    I am happy. Why can't you believe<br>
    that?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/16/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    I wish I could. How much<br>
    happiness is there in always being<br>
    there for someone else, but never<br>
    being there for yourself?</p>
  <p> Troi feels the anger heating up inside her, fights to<br>
    control it. After all, she's a trained psychologist.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I get great satisfaction out of<br>
    my work.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    I'm sure it's rewarding, in its<br>
    way. But what about a family?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    This is my family -- my friends<br>
    -- here on the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (hurt)<br>
    I am your family, or have you<br>
    forgotten? And if I have to spell<br>
    it out for you, I'm talking about<br>
    finding a husband, having a child.<br>
    That's what made me happy. At<br>
    least until now.</p>
  <p> Troi suppresses her growing anger, hoping to avoid a<br>
    fight.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Look, Mother. Perhaps some day<br>
    I'll marry. But you've got to<br>
    let me make my own choices...<br>
    live my own life, not the life<br>
    you'd choose for me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/13/90 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (driving it home)<br>
    You had a chance... with Commander<br>
    Riker. And look how you ruined<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> That does it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (angry now)<br>
    I did not ruin anything. We<br>
    became very good friends.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    All the better. You certainly<br>
    wouldn't want to marry an enemy.<br>
    (on Troi's look:)<br>
    But I see we can't discuss this.<br>
    So have it your way, Little One.</p>
  <p> That really does it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Little One? When I was five you<br>
    called me that. Stop demeaning<br>
    me and address me as an adult.</p>
  <p> Troi storms out.</p>
  <p>10 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Troi's not even sure where she's going; she just had to<br>
    get out of there. And as she walks, she hears:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (TELEPATHIC V.O.)<br>
    I'll be home on Betazed if you<br>
    need me, Lit --<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Deanna.</p>
  <p>11 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker have been listening to a briefing from<br>
    Data, Geordi and Wesley on equipment to be used in<br>
    the next mission. Wesley is concluding his report.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/20/90 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Adding preprocessors to the<br>
    neutrino counters boosted<br>
    efficiency by eleven percent.<br>
    Of course, Commander La Forge and<br>
    Commander Data did most of the<br>
    work...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not so fast, Wesley.<br>
    Preprocessing the data with an<br>
    optical chip was your idea.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Correct, sir. Although Commander<br>
    La Forge and I designed the chip,<br>
    Ensign Crusher derived the<br>
    equations governing its operation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The point is, you've completed<br>
    our upgrade well ahead of<br>
    schedule. Most impressive.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Indeed, Number One. Fine work<br>
    -- especially you, Mister Crusher.<br>
    We're going to miss you.</p>
  <p> Wesley can't help it. He knows what's coming and the<br>
    grin just grows until he's all smiles.</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    As you might guess, your final<br>
    entrance examination scores for<br>
    Starfleet Academy have arrived.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Congratulations. As soon as you<br>
    complete the oral exam, you'll<br>
    be formally admitted.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/20/90 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'll have you back at Betazed<br>
    in plenty of time to meet the<br>
    Academy transport ship.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That will be all.</p>
  <p> They begin to EXIT.</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    A moment, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your science team is very<br>
    efficient. How many days would<br>
    you say they managed to shave off<br>
    our mission?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Approximately three. Thanks to<br>
    the equipment upgrade, we'll be<br>
    able to complete our survey in<br>
    less than twenty-four hours.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Splendid, Number One.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    You'd agree that this is a rather<br>
    routine mapping mission?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (what's he getting at?)<br>
    Yes, sir...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor Troi had the good sense<br>
    to request shore leave. I see<br>
    I'm going to have to suggest it<br>
    to you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/14/90 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Riker opens his mouth to protest, then begins to think<br>
    it over. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad. At his slight<br>
    smile:</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    Have a good time, Number One.</p>
  <p>12 EXT. BETAZED - DAY - MATTE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A 24th-century &quot;city&quot; -- technologically advanced<br>
    yet so well blended in with nature so that the effect<br>
    is relaxing and pastoral.</p>
  <p>13 EXT. BETAZED CLEARING - DAY</p>
  <p> A secluded spot in the greenbelt. Lush plants surround<br>
    this open area, and a dirt path leads off into dense<br>
    foliage. Riker and Troi are looking for something in<br>
    the greenery. Their mood is light as they enjoy this<br>
    brief shore leave.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sure it was around here<br>
    somewhere...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's been a few years. Maybe it<br>
    died.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You know Muktok plants live for<br>
    hundreds of years...</p>
  <p> Riker brushes aside some leaves to reveal an<br>
    exotic-looking plant with bluish foliage and eight<br>
    silver flowers.</p>
  <p> RIKER (cont'd)<br>
    Here it is...</p>
  <p> Troi joins Riker as he touches the blooms. SOUND of<br>
    MUSICAL NOTES, an alien melody.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's lovely. I remember this<br>
    music... and all the good times<br>
    we had.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/19/90 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A certain junior lieutenant will<br>
    always remember meeting a very<br>
    serious psychology student. It<br>
    was the best thing about being<br>
    assigned to Betazed.</p>
  <p> It's a rare moment of closeness for them, and it seems<br>
    quite natural for Riker to put his arm around her and<br>
    give her a warm kiss. The moment is interrupted by the<br>
    sound of a voice.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (O.S.)<br>
    Put the food down over there,<br>
    Mister Homn.</p>
  <p> Startled, Troi pulls away from Riker. She gives him a<br>
    look: It can't be her! Riker and Troi step out of the<br>
    greenery to see Lwaxana supervising Mister Homn as he<br>
    empties the contents of a metal container onto a<br>
    silvery blanket. Lwaxana looks up, sees Riker and her<br>
    daughter.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Isn't it a beautiful day for a<br>
    picnic?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (irritated)<br>
    Mother! How did you know about<br>
    this place?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Your father used to bring me<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/13/90 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Mr. Homn pours glasses of some mead-colored liquid,<br>
    passes it around and begins imbibing at an incredibly<br>
    fast pace. Riker and Troi realize they have no choice<br>
    but to make the best of it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (keeping it light)<br>
    And you even brought provisions.<br>
    Very thoughtful.</p>
  <p> Lwaxana passes him something yellow with purple veins.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Try this oskoid. The sap keeps<br>
    it deliciously warm.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (trying it)<br>
    Very, very tasty.<br>
    (he eyes her)<br>
    Tell me, Lwaxana, the last time<br>
    we met, you were searching for<br>
    a husband. Did you have any luck?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Alas, no, but what happens to me<br>
    isn't important. I'm more<br>
    concerned about other people<br>
    getting on with their lives.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother, this isn't the time or<br>
    the place...</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (who me?)<br>
    Did I mention any names?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (angry)<br>
    You didn't have to.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/16/90 - ACT ONE 17.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Can I help it if all my friends<br>
    are becoming grandparents?<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    How about you, Will. Have you<br>
    ever thought of having children?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (an honest answer)<br>
    There was a time when I thought<br>
    having children and a career in<br>
    Starfleet were incompatible. But<br>
    with Galaxy class starships having<br>
    families aboard, I've considered<br>
    that possibility...</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Yes, the Enterprise would be a<br>
    perfect environment to raise a<br>
    family... with someone...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (warning)<br>
    Mother!</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (ignoring her)<br>
    Mister Homn, I saw some<br>
    uttaberries along the path. Be<br>
    a dear and pick some for<br>
    dessert...</p>
  <p> He nods, goes off down the path with the metal<br>
    container.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (cont'd)<br>
    Mister Homn and I can go back home<br>
    if you two want to be alone. It's<br>
    such a romantic setting...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (furious now)<br>
    Mother, stop it!</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Darling, you're so excitable these<br>
    days. Have you thought about a<br>
    leave of absence? I could talk<br>
    to Jean-Luc...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/19/90 - ACT ONE 18.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to keep peace)<br>
    Deanna, try one of the oskoids.<br>
    They're different.</p>
  <p> But now their attention is diverted by the SOUND of<br>
    an alien transporter beam.</p>
  <p> RIKER (cont'd)<br>
    What the... ?</p>
  <p>14 ANGLE ON DAIMON TOG (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as his image COALESCES in a Ferengi TRANSPORTER BEAM.</p>
  <p>15 BACK TO SHOT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker jumps to attention. The others are equally<br>
    surprised. Tog extends a bunch of sorrowful Ferengi<br>
    daisies to Lwaxana.</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    A gift for one whose beauty<br>
    surpasses even these pericules.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Daimon Tog! I thought the<br>
    Krayton left orbit hours ago.</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    It did. But when I tried to put<br>
    the image of Lwaxana Troi out of<br>
    my mind... I could not succeed.</p>
  <p> Lwaxana tosses the flowers into the pond.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    This is ludicrous! You came back<br>
    to Betazed -- for me?</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    Why continue to search for<br>
    perfection once you've found it?<br>
    And when I considered how useful<br>
    you would be...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't believe this...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/19/90 - ACT ONE 19.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (to Tog)<br>
    Look, Demon Tog, or whatever you<br>
    call yourself, I am the Daughter<br>
    of the Fifth House of Betazed,<br>
    Keeper of the Holy Rings. And<br>
    unless you want to create an<br>
    interstellar incident, you had<br>
    better beam back to your ship.</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    Returning to my ship is exactly<br>
    what I had in mind.<br>
    (using communicator)<br>
    Krayton, transport four<br>
    immediately.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, Tog!</p>
  <p> Riker goes for his phaser, realizes he hasn't brought<br>
    it to this usually peaceful place.</p>
  <p> He moves toward the Ferengi when the four of them<br>
    DISAPPEAR in the Ferengi TRANSPORTER BEAM, leaving only<br>
    an empty clearing.</p>
  <p>16 ANGLE ON PATH</p>
  <p> as Mister Homn returns, his container full of green<br>
    berries. His lips are stained dark green -- he's been<br>
    eating much of what he's picked. He looks around at<br>
    the empty clearing -- where is everyone? Probably off<br>
    playing a game, so he pops another uttaberry into his<br>
    mouth while he waits for them to return.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>17 EXT. SPACE - FERENGI VESSEL KRAYTON (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> traveling at warp speed.</p>
  <p>18 INT. FERENGI HOLDING TANK (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Typical of a Ferengi ship: an ill-designed,<br>
    unattractive room. The furnishings are sparse. One<br>
    end of the room opens into an area where a companel<br>
    station is staffed by Nibor. A three-dimensional chess<br>
    board is on the console. Separating this holding tank<br>
    from Nibor is a lighted arch, suggesting a forcefield.<br>
    Riker, Troi, and Lwaxana are unconscious. Riker is<br>
    the first to come to, immediately going to Deanna and<br>
    her mother.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Deanna? Lwaxana?</p>
  <p> He rouses them to consciousness.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Where are we?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (indicating Nibor)<br>
    From the smell of things, I'd<br>
    say we're aboard a Ferengi vessel.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    The Ferengi can't do this! You're<br>
    Starfleet officers!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Tog must have missed that chapter<br>
    in the Ferengi Book of Etiquette.</p>
  <p> Riker tries his communicator. Nothing happens. He<br>
    adjusts, tries again.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Enterprise is too far out of<br>
    range.</p>
  <p> He moves to the arch, tests it, gets repelled hard by<br>
    the forcefield.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/19/90 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>

  <p> NIBOR<br>
    Daimon... they have regained<br>
    consciousness.</p>
  <p> TOG'S COM VOICE<br>
    Very good.</p>
  <p> Riker turns to Lwaxana in time to see both the women<br>
    DISAPPEAR in a FERENGI TRANSPORTER EFFECT. Oddly,<br>
    their clothing has not travelled with them! Riker<br>
    picks up Troi's uniform, turns to Nibor:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (angry)<br>
    What have you done with them?</p>
  <p> But Nibor doesn't answer, leaving Riker to ponder the<br>
    fate of the Trois.</p>
  <p>19 INT. FERENGI LAB (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Another example of tasteful Ferengi interior<br>
    decorating. Not a pleasant setting. Various pieces of<br>
    strange and dangerous-looking equipment are everywhere.<br>
    Compounds have spilled over and crusted on table<br>
    surfaces. It's the kind of place you'd like to scrub<br>
    down with Lysol. Troi and Lwaxana MATERIALIZE here,<br>
    completely naked. Lwaxana reacts to this.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    I should have known. Even their<br>
    transporters can't be trusted.</p>
  <p> Dr. Farek ENTERS from a side room.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why have you removed our clothing?</p>
  <p> FAREK<br>
    Females do not deserve the honor<br>
    of clothing.</p>

    We are not Ferengi females.<br>

    They're as bad as humans. Look<br>
    at the leer on his face.</p>
  <p>20 ANGLE TO INCLUDE TOG (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> who ENTERS as Lwaxana is speaking.</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    No, his is an expression of<br>
    revulsion. But it is a feeling<br>
    I do not share, Lwaxana.</p>
  <p> Lwaxana and Troi have found something with which to<br>
    partially cover themselves. Lwaxana throws a quick<br>
    look at Tog.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    It's cold in here. Do you want<br>
    me to become ill?</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    No, I don't. Farek, please<br>
    arrange for their clothing to be<br>
    returned.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Thank you, Daimon Tog.</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    (so charming)<br>
    You must forgive the Doctor. He<br>
    is not accustomed to dealing with<br>
    Betazoid females.<br>
    (eyeing Lwaxana)<br>
    I have a business proposition for<br>
    you...</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Thanks, but I'm not interested<br>
    in any of your propositions.</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    Hear me out. Your telepathic<br>
    powers could bring us both great<br>
    profit.</p>

    Lwaxana is a sensible female...</p>
  <p> TROI (TELEPATHIC V.O.)<br>

    mother.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (TELEPATHIC V.O.)<br>

    Just the two of us.</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    A wise choice. Farek, leave us.<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    And you may rejoin your friend.</p>
  <p> Farek EXITS. Tog goes to a companel, hits a specific<br>
    series of lighted areas. Troi DEMATERIALIZES in the<br>
    FERENGI TRANSPORTER EFFECT.</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    (hot to trot)<br>
    And now, Lwaxana Troi, let us<br>
    &quot;talk&quot;...</p>
  <p> Tog leers at Lwaxana. This is the moment he's been<br>
    waiting for. Tog presses another panel, and a bed<br>
    slides out from a wall.</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Thanks, Data. Now if I can just<br>
    do well on the oral exam...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You will. And when you return,<br>
    we'll be gaining the best ensign<br>
    in the fleet.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Actually, there is no guarantee<br>
    Wesley will be reassigned to the<br>
    Enterprise. Eighty-four per cent<br>
    of Starfleet graduates are not<br>
    posted to Galaxy class starships<br>
    for their first assignment.</p>
  <p> Wesley reacts to this unexpected bit of news.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I never thought about that... I<br>
    always assumed I'd be coming back<br>
    to the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm sure Captain Picard will<br>
    request you... if he's still<br>
    commanding the Enterprise when<br>
    you graduate.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I hadn't thought about that,<br>
    either.<br>

  <p> Riker stands, crosses to the arch, studies the<br>

    I wouldn't do that...</p>

  <p> Nibor ignores Riker, makes the move anyway. The<br>
    Ferengi crewman promptly makes his move -- and Nibor<br>

    suppress the subspace<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Meaning if I set up a simple<br>

    (studying schematic)<br>
    The trick is to create a message<br>
    that the Enterprise will<br>
    understand... but that the Ferengi<br>
    will think is just normal<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Ferengi transmissions are<br>
    routinely scrambled and encoded,<br>

    confidence in your ability to<br>
    perform the impossible.</p>
  <p> Geordi, Wesley, and Data keep working as the various<br>
    scanned SIGNALS continue. One signal contains a<br>
    particular pattern of rhythmic POPPING that catches<br>
    Wesley's attention for a moment -- though Wesley can't<br>
    put his finger on why. Then another SIGNAL in the scan<br>
    replaces it.</p>

    Wesley steps onto the pad.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Something the matter?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    We've been scanning Ferengi<br>

  <p> Picard is surprised, but before he can respond, Wesley<br>
    ENTERS from the Turbolift. Everyone reacts.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Captain, I think there's a pattern<br>
    to the subspace interference I<br>
    heard on one of the Ferengi<br>
    messages.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wesley, unless you leave<br>

  <p> Wesley nods -- he knows what he's doing -- and<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    The interference itself could be<br>

  <p> We HEAR the various CODED RADIO SIGNALS as before.<br>
    Wesley listens intently until he hears the SIGNAL with<br>
    the pattern of INTERFERENCE POPPING that caught his<br>
    attention before.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Wait -- repeat that one. Put it<br>
    on a continuous replay.</p>
  <p> Data does so. The SIGNAL keeps playing.</p>
  <p> WESLEY (cont'd)<br>
    Hear that popping noise? Data,<br>
    can you filter out everything but<br>
    that sound?</p>
  <p> Data works the console. We now HEAR only the rhythmic<br>
    POPPING. Now that it's isolated, it's easier to<br>
    identify --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's Cochrane distortion... a<br>
    fluctuation in the phase of the<br>
    subspace field. All warp engines<br>
    generate that kind of<br>
    interference.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But listen to the pattern... it's<br>
    the Algolian ceremonial rhythm<br>
    the musician was playing at the<br>
    reception.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Mister Crusher is correct, sir.<br>
    There is a temporal correlation.</p>

    Ingenious. He selected a signal<br>

    mine and I refuse to let you go.<br>
    Return to my side immediately.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (hopeful)<br>
    You mean... you still care?</p>
  <p> Words fail Picard. He searches his memory for<br>
    something -- anything -- to say, finally hits upon<br>
    Shakespeare:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    &quot;My love is a fever, longing still<br>
    For that which longer nurseth the disease.&quot;</p>
  <p> Reactions all around.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (melting)<br>
    Tell me more...</p>

  <p>61 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    &quot;In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,<br>
    For they in thee a thousand errors note;<br>
    But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise;<br>
    Who in despite of view is pleas'd to dote.&quot;</p>
  <p> Under this:</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    (to Lwaxana)<br>
    You didn't tell me that you and<br>
    Captain Picard were --</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (interrupting Tog)<br>
    You said you didn't want to hear<br>
    about all my romances.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I have a new love, Jean-Luc. And<br>
    you can't keep killing all my<br>
    lovers. That simply has to stop.</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    Killing?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    He's insanely jealous.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/19/90 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>61 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Listen, Tog, no one possesses<br>
    Lwaxana but me. And if I have<br>
    to destroy your ship in the<br>
    process, so be it.</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    Captain, I had no idea Lwaxana<br>
    was your woman.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (to Tog)<br>
    Don't let him threaten you. You<br>
    can defeat him.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    The only way you'll get me back<br>
    is over Tog's dead body!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That can be arranged. Mister<br>
    Worf, arm all phaser banks and<br>
    photon torpedoes. If my beloved<br>
    is not in my arms in ten seconds,<br>
    throw everything you've got at<br>
    the Krayton.</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    But you'll destroy Lwaxana!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    'Tis better to have loved and lost<br>
    than never to have loved at all...<br>
    Eight, seven...</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    No, wait!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Six... five...</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    (hits companel)<br>
    Beam her to their Bridge... now!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Three... two...</p>
  <p> And Lwaxana MATERIALIZES on the Bridge. Playing her<br>
    part in the charade, she rushes to Picard, throws her<br>
    arms around him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/20/90 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>61 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    You wonderfully jealous fool.</p>
  <p> TOG<br>
    I trust there will be no further<br>
    action taken against us?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Such as reporting this incident<br>
    to your superiors who may question<br>
    your competency as Daimon? I'll<br>
    think about it.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Screen off.</p>
  <p> And Picard cuts the communication. He looks to Lwaxana<br>
    -- &quot;charade's over.&quot; Lwaxana, however, doesn't let<br>
    go.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (amorously)<br>
    Thank you, Jean-Luc. You were<br>
    most convincing.<br>
    (purring)<br>
    You certainly convinced me...</p>
  <p> Picard has some difficulty extricating himself from<br>
    Lwaxana's arms.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mrs. Troi, I'm truly grateful that<br>
    you risked your life for my...<br>
    (breaks free)<br>
    ...people. I'll have you home<br>
    within hours.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Really, that isn't necessary,<br>
    Captain...<br>
    (provocatively)<br>
    I'd love to hear more of that<br>
    poetry...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps another time. Mister<br>
    Crusher, set course for Betazed.<br>
    (glancing at Lwaxana)<br>
    Warp Nine.</p>
  <p> Lwaxana turns to Troi:</p>

  <p>61 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (TELEPATHIC V.O.)<br>
    There's so much to talk about,<br>
    Little One... such as your future.<br>
    Reittan Grax was telling me the<br>
    other day that he has the nicest<br>
    nephew...</p>

  <p>64 INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard is reading something on his PADD as Wesley<br>
    enters.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You asked to see me, Captain?</p>
  <p> Picard barely looks up.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've been in touch with Admiral<br>
    Hahn at Starfleet Academy.</p>
  <p> Wesley's expression turns hopeful. Maybe there's still<br>
    a chance somehow...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/20/90 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>64 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    The Admiral regrets your missing<br>
    the oral examination and hopes<br>
    you'll reapply next year.</p>
  <p> Wesley hides his disappointment. No loopholes here.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I understand, sir.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    I do intend to reapply.</p>
  <p> Picard nods -- good.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In the interim... the Academy's<br>
    loss is our gain. I'm gratified<br>
    the Enterprise will continue to<br>
    benefit from your talents for<br>
    another year.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Thank you, Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard returns his attention to the PADD. Wesley<br>
    stands, waits to be dismissed. Nothing. Wesley's<br>
    beginning to feel awkward. Finally:</p>
  <p> WESLEY (cont'd)<br>
    Is that all, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There is one more thing.</p>
  <p> Picard looks up.</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    For some time now I have been<br>
    contemplating a certain action.<br>
    Your conduct today has convinced<br>
    me to take that action.</p>
  <p> Wesley stands mute, wondering if he's in trouble.</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    I've reviewed your service record<br>
    thoroughly... and I've decided<br>
    upon the appropriate course.</p>
  <p> Is there a twinkle in Picard's eye?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Menage a Troi&quot; - REV. 3/20/90 - ACT FIVE 57A.</p>
  <p>64 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    I am granting you a field<br>
    promotion to full Ensign.</p>
  <p> Wesley's face lights up. Before Wesley can speak:</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    Congratulations.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    You're dismissed.</p>

    Lwaxana Troi has beamed down to<br>

  <p> Wesley ENTERS, now in the crimson Starfleet uniform<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Notify Starfleet we are en route<br>

    rendezvous with the Zapata.</p>

    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign Crusher, take us out of<br>

    Aye, sir.<br>

    Course set.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Engage.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks proudly over at Wesley, who takes a<br>
    moment to relish his new status. Yes! This is going<br>
