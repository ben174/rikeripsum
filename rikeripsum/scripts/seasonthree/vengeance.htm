  <p> The two-man Federation scientific outpost has been<br>
    looted -- stripped of all equipment. Instrumentation<br>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>6 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> MEDICS are tending to the two scientists. Beverly's<br>
    analyzing the bloody piece of metal. Picard, Riker and<br>
    Data ENTER. Beverly reports:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The two scientists are suffering<br>
    from phaser stuns... I'd guess<br>
    several hits each.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Several... when one would surely<br>
    have sufficed.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It'll take us a while to bring<br>
    them around, but they'll recover.</p>
  <p> She indicates the sample she's analyzing.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (cont'd)<br>
    We found a sample of blood. It's<br>
    a rare iron-copper composite,<br>
    unique to one humanoid species:<br>
    the Acamarians.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Acamarians.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    That would suggest... the<br>
    Gatherers.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A likely hypothesis. The nomadic<br>
    marauders who refer to themselves<br>
    as Gatherers have raided other<br>
    outposts in neighboring sectors.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But they've never ventured this<br>
    far before.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; - REV. 10/9/89 - ACT ONE 5.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    And we cannot permit them to<br>
    spread their violent ways further.<br>
    (keys insignia)<br>
    Mister Crusher, set course for<br>
    the Acamar system.</p>
  <p> WESLEY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Assuming orbit around a planet -- Acamar Three.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43562.9.<br>
    In an effort to put an end to the<br>
    Gatherer raids, we have come to<br>
    the Acamar System to enlist the<br>
    aid of Marouk, the sovereign of<br>
    Acamar Three.</p>
  <p>8 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, TROI. At the head of the table sits an<br>
    imposing, aristocratic middle-aged woman: MAROUK,<br>
    sovereign of Acamar.</p>
  <p> Standing unobtrusively behind Marouk is a beefy male<br>
    BODYGUARD.</p>
  <p> Acamarians are humanoid, perhaps a bit unkempt and<br>
    primitive (in appearance, not in intelligence) by our<br>
    standards.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; - REV. 10/6/89 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Their raids have made this sector<br>
    unsafe. Our research facilities<br>
    have been ransacked; trade routes<br>
    disrupted...</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    The Gatherers are elusive; we've<br>
    only managed to capture a handful<br>
    of them. However, with<br>
    Starfleet's help...</p>
  <p> She's got the wrong idea. Picard interrupts sharply:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hunting them down is not what<br>
    I'm proposing.</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    Reconciliation with the Gatherers<br>
    is impossible. It's been tried.<br>
    Every time we've offered amnesty,<br>
    they've rejected it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    When was the last attempt made?</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    Eighteen years ago.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Eighteen years?</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    Yes. We gave up trying.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    Because the Gatherers aren't<br>
    willing to change! For almost<br>
    a century, they've been<br>
    parasites... moving from star<br>
    system to star system, living on<br>
    what they could find... or steal.<br>
    They're little more than<br>
    barbarians.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They are still your people.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; - REV. 10/6/89 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    No. Captain, you have to<br>
    understand our history. A hundred<br>
    years ago, before the Gatherers<br>
    split off from our culture, we<br>
    were a savage, violent race.<br>
    Clans battled clans... bloody,<br>
    vengeful feuds that lasted for<br>
    generations.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    But we overcame those ways...<br>
    broke the cycle of fighting and<br>
    revenge. All except the<br>
    Gatherers.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    After a century of wandering,<br>
    they may be ready to come home.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Despite all your progress, your<br>
    society is still divided. And<br>
    it will remain so until the<br>
    Gatherers return to Acamar.</p>
  <p> Picard's words have had an effect. Marouk thinks it<br>
    over.</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    The attempt may be futile.</p>
  <p> Picard stands.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You have much to gain and little<br>
    to lose in making the effort.<br>
    The problem affects us all... it<br>
    cannot be ignored.</p>
  <p> Marouk looks at Picard, grudgingly nods. She knows<br>
    he's right.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Vengeance Factor&quot; - REV. 10/2/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>9 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data, Wesley, Worf, supernumeraries. Picard, Riker,<br>
    Troi, Marouk, and the bodyguard ENTER from the<br>
    Observation Lounge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sovereign Marouk, how soon will<br>
    you be ready to leave Acamar?</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    I am ready now, Captain. I need<br>
    only bring aboard two more<br>
    servants...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll see to that... and to your<br>
    accommodations, Sovereign.</p>
  <p> Marouk nods a thank you to Riker, turns to Picard:</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    I have reason to believe there<br>
    is a Gatherer encampment somewhere<br>
    in the Hromi Cluster.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Federation has charted but<br>
    not explored several Class M<br>
    planets in that area. Any of<br>
    those planets might well serve<br>
    as a base.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Crusher, set course for<br>
    the Hromi Cluster.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p>10 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> leaving its orbit of Acamar Three.</p>
  <p>11 INT. GUEST QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Marouk ENTERS, followed by Riker. She crosses to<br>
    the port, looks out at the stars as the ship goes into<br>
    Warp. An impressive sight. Marouk turns to Riker:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; - REV. 10/9/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    A fine ship, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're very proud of her.</p>
  <p> In b.g., the bodyguard and two more servants ENTER,<br>
    carrying suitcases. One new arrival is a middle-aged<br>
    female MAID.</p>
  <p> The other is YUTA, a fragile girl in her early<br>
    twenties; pretty, with a delicate, quiet manner. Like<br>
    all Marouk's servants, if she has a personality it's<br>
    invisible.</p>
  <p>12 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Yuta sets down the suitcase, looks up. Her eyes<br>
    happen to meet Riker's. A friendly smile from Riker.</p>
  <p> Some women would turn away, blushing shyly; some would<br>
    smile back in friendship -- or invitation. Yuta does<br>
    neither -- just looks incuriously at Riker. No<br>
    reaction at all.</p>
  <p> MAROUK (O.S.)<br>
    Yuta --</p>
  <p>13 WIDER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Yuta turns to Marouk.</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    A light meal in twenty minutes.</p>
  <p> Yuta nods in obedience, but Marouk has already turned<br>
    away to look out the port at the stars streaking by.</p>
  <p>14 ON YUTA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> approaching Riker. In b.g., the other servants are<br>
    unpacking the suitcases.</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    May I be shown to the kitchen,<br>
    Commander?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; - REV. 10/9/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're the chef?</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    Yes. I'll prepare all meals for<br>
    the sovereign and her servants.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We can provide you with a kitchen<br>
    if you wish... but it's not really<br>
    necessary. The food dispensers<br>
    can synthesize anything you want.</p>
  <p> Yuta absorbs this without reaction. Riker leads Yuta<br>
    to a food slot.</p>
  <p> RIKER (cont'd)<br>
    I'll show you.<br>
    (to Marouk)<br>
    Sovereign, may I offer you a<br>
    drink?</p>
  <p> Marouk doesn't turn from the port:</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    Yes, thank you. Cold water.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to food slot)<br>
    A glass of water... five degrees.</p>
  <p> A glass of water MATERIALIZES in the food slot. Yuta<br>
    shows mild interest. Riker takes the glass, starts<br>
    to deliver it to Marouk. Yuta politely blocks him,<br>
    extends her hand for the glass.</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    Please.</p>
  <p> Riker's about to say &quot;it's all right, I'll do it&quot; --<br>
    but there's something immovable about her stance. He<br>
    hands her the glass. She sniffs it, calmly takes a<br>
    sip. Riker doesn't know whether to be amused or<br>
    horrified.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're also the food taster?</p>
  <p> Yuta looks at him -- what's so odd about that?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; - REV. 10/9/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    That's part of the cook's duties.</p>
  <p> Satisfied she hasn't been poisoned, Yuta takes the<br>
    glass to Marouk, who accepts it without comment. Yuta<br>
    returns to Riker.</p>
  <p> YUTA (cont'd)<br>
    I'm sure the sovereign will wish<br>
    to sample many of the cuisines<br>
    your ship has to offer, but there<br>
    are certain Acamarian dishes she<br>
    will insist upon.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll arrange for a technician to<br>
    help you program your recipes<br>
    into the computer. I'd like to<br>
    try some myself. What's your<br>
    specialty?</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    I have none.</p>
  <p> A simple statement of fact. Riker smiles at her. His<br>
    natural good will and charm would melt an ice cap.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Don't be modest. You can't tell<br>
    me you haven't come up with a<br>
    few original triumphs...</p>
  <p> And, wonder of wonders, Yuta smiles back. Not much of<br>
    a smile... but it's a start.</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    There is a spiced parthus dish...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    &quot;Parthus?&quot;</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    A green vegetable with fleshy<br>
    roots.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ah. Parthus... a la Yuta. I<br>
    look forward to tasting it.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; - REV. 10/6/89 - ACT ONE 12.</p>

  <p> RIKER (Cont'd)<br>
    (to Marouk, taking his<br>
    leave)<br>
    Sovereign...</p>
  <p> But Marouk's still gazing with fascination out the<br>
    port, doesn't hear him. Riker turns back to Yuta,<br>
    gives her a respectful nod:</p>
  <p> RIKER (cont'd)<br>
    Chef...</p>
  <p> Riker exits. Yuta's small smile increases a bit.<br>
    Servants don't get this sort of attention; she's not<br>
    quite sure how to respond... but she likes Riker.</p>

  <p> Riker, Worf, GEORDI, and Data MATERIALIZE in the midst<br>
    of a &quot;junkyard&quot; of high-tech equipment scattered about.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; - REV. 10/10/89 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf scans the area with his tricorder as Geordi, Data<br>
    and Riker inspect the various piles of stuff.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Artonian lasers, Tonkian homing<br>
    beacons... quite a collection.</p>
  <p> Data looks at a pile of scrap metal.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Noranium alloys. Their salvage<br>
    value is low.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Looks like the Gatherers aren't<br>
    very discriminating in what they<br>
    steal.</p>
  <p> Worf looks over the array, then announces with disgust:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The spoils of animals without<br>
    honor.</p>
  <p> Worf lifts a tarp on another pile.</p>
  <p> WORF (cont'd)<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> Riker, Data, and Geordi step up to examine Worf's find<br>
    -- a small reactor.</p>
  <p>18 CLOSE ON WORF</p>
  <p> frowning suddenly. He sniffs the air, then grabs<br>
    Riker, Data, and Geordi, pulls them to the ground --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Ambush!</p>
  <p>19 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as THREE GATHERERS (BRULL, TEMAREK, and one n.d.) --<br>
    armed with phaser rifles -- pop out from behind a ridge<br>
    and take aim at the away team. (Like their Acamarian<br>
    cousins, the Gatherers are muscular humanoids with a<br>
    &quot;primitive&quot; appearance -- belied by their sophisticated<br>
    weapons.) They FIRE.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; - REV. 10/9/89 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>20 ON RIKER, WORF, GEORDI, AND DATA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as a PHASER BLAST just misses them.</p>
  <p>21 WIDER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data, Riker, and Geordi scramble behind some rocks as<br>
    Worf provides a BLAST of cover FIRE, then he too finds<br>
    cover.</p>
  <p>22 ON RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> his back against a rock, and phaser in hand.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Rigellian phaser rifles. Not very<br>
    powerful.</p>
  <p> Another BLAST scorches the rock nearby.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Powerful enough...</p>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>23 EXT. GATHERER CAMP - NIGHT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As before. The three Gatherers have positioned<br>
    themselves well -- Riker, Data, and Geordi are pinned<br>
    behind a cluster of equipment while Worf is behind<br>
    another. Riker yells to the Gatherers:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We want to talk --</p>
  <p> A phaser BLAST from the Gatherers confirms they aren't<br>
    interested in chatter.</p>
  <p>24 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Worf moves closer to Riker, Data, and Geordi --<br>
    his adroit maneuvering sparing him from a phaser HIT.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Your words are wasted, Commander.<br>
    (holding up his phaser)<br>
    They understand only this.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (convincing himself as<br>
    well)<br>
    We're here to establish a<br>
    dialogue.</p>
  <p> A phaser bolt STREAKS OVERHEAD. Then Riker has a<br>
    thought:</p>
  <p>24A RIKER'S POV</p>
  <p> of the pile of scrap metal Data looked at earlier.</p>
  <p>24B ON RIKER</p>
  <p> as he turns to Data.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data... noranium vaporizes at... ?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; - REV. 10/10/89 - ACT TWO 16.</p>
  <p>24B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Two thousand three hundred<br>
    fourteen degrees. Of course,<br>
    noranium carbide alloys vaporize<br>
    at a slightly higher temperature.</p>
  <p> Riker indicates the pile of alloys -- Worf, Data, and<br>
    Geordi catch on.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Phaser setting seven ought to do<br>
    it...</p>
  <p> Riker nods; all four adjust their phasers.</p>
  <p>25 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Riker, Data, Geordi, and Worf FIRE at the pile of<br>
    noranium. The noranium quickly bellows huge clouds of<br>
    SMOKE -- filling the area almost immediately.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Now!</p>
  <p>25A ANGLE</p>
  <p> In a quick moment, Riker gives the others sotto voce<br>
    instructions, then using the smoke as cover, the four<br>
    make a break for it.</p>
  <p>26 ON THE GATHERERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> trying to peer through the smoke. We hear:</p>
  <p> RIKER (O.S.)<br>
    Enterprise -- four to beam up!<br>
    Energize!</p>
  <p> Brull, the Gatherer leader, sneers with contempt.</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    Cowards.</p>
  <p> Brull turns his attention to the rising smoke. He<br>
    grabs a bucket of sand and pours it on the noranium.<br>
    The two others Gatherers follow suit. After a beat,<br>
    the smoke ceases.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; - REV. 10/11/89 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>27 ON BRULL</p>
  <p> as he breathes a sigh of relief -- his precious loot<br>
    not completely lost.</p>
  <p> As the smoke clears --</p>
  <p>28 ANGLE ON RIKER, WORF, DATA, AND GEORDI</p>
  <p> emerging from the smoke -- phasers aimed at Brull and<br>
    the two Gatherers.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Brull)<br>
    Your ambushes would be more<br>
    successful if you bathed more<br>
    often.</p>
  <p> Brull GRUMBLES, but he knows there is nothing he or<br>
    his Gatherers can do.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've brought the sovereign of<br>
    Acamar...</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Marouk... here?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nods)<br>
    With an offer of amnesty.</p>
  <p> Brull and the other two Gatherers are curious, but<br>
    suspicious.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>29 OMITTED</p>
  <p>30 EXT. GATHERER CAMP - NIGHT</p>
  <p> CLOSE on Yuta taking a sip of wine. WIDEN to reveal<br>
    Marouk, her bodyguard, Picard, Riker, Troi, Worf,<br>
    Brull, and other Gatherers (including VOLNOTH, a old<br>
    man, and Temarek) sitting in a circle around a FIRE.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; - REV. 10/11/89 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MAROUK (O.S.)<br>
    Full dispensation will be extended<br>
    to all Gatherers who are willing<br>
    to return to Acamar Three.</p>
  <p> After a beat, Yuta nods -- &quot;it's okay&quot; -- and hands the<br>
    chalice to Marouk, who drinks. Brull frowns</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    You don't trust me.</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    Should I?</p>
  <p> Marouk passes the chalice to Brull.</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    Oh, but you expect me to trust<br>
    you. Perhaps you just poisoned<br>
    it yourself.</p>
  <p> He gruffly hands the chalice to Temarek... all this<br>
    for show...</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    Taste it.</p>
  <p> Temarek looks and says who me? Brull finally grabs<br>
    his hair, and pours the wine down his throat,<br>
    laughs... Marouk is furious, insulted, standing, looks<br>
    to Picard...</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    Barbarians... this is futile...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sovereign...</p>
  <p> Rising voices upon voices --</p>

    Go home, old woman...</p>

    Brull...</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    You people haven't changed in a<br>
    hundred years.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; - REV. 10/11/89 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    You were there. You should know.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sit down.</p>
  <p> They both stop and look at Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are here to talk.</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    It is a waste of time, Captain...<br>
    they don't care how they live...</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    And I am supposed to believe that<br>
    you do care how we live?</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    She is here, isn't she, Brull?</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    Perhaps you forced her...</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    Nobody forces me anywhere,<br>
    Brull... nobody.</p>
  <p> Brull looks at her, believes it, grins, sits down.<br>
    Picard looks at Marouk, she sits.</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    (feigning disinterest)<br>
    What is there for us on Acamar<br>
    Three?</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    A life. A home. You can end your<br>
    wandering, your miserable<br>
    existence...</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    Do I look miserable?</p>
  <p> Marouk's first instinct is to go back at him... but<br>
    Picard looks her off.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; - REV. 10/11/89 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    The clan wars are over, Brull.<br>
    It is a past we are ashamed of.<br>
    It is why you had to leave.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Now it is time to come home.</p>
  <p> Brull thinks it over. Maybe it's a worthwhile offer.<br>
    But being a good poker player, he keeps a gruff face as<br>
    he commands:</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    I want to talk privately with<br>
    Picard and Marouk. Everyone else<br>
    -- leave.</p>
  <p> The other Gatherers get to their feet. Yuta and<br>
    Marouk's bodyguard look to Marouk. She nods to them --<br>
    &quot;go.&quot; Picard indicates to Riker, Worf, and Troi that<br>
    they should go, too.</p>
  <p>30A NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As everyone -- including Riker, Troi, and Worf -- leave<br>
    Picard, Marouk, and Brull to negotiate. Riker looks to<br>
    Troi:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Any insights, Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Brull's ready to negotiate. He<br>
    wants privacy so he won't appear<br>
    weak in the presence of the other<br>
    Gatherers.</p>
  <p> Riker nods agreement. They look back at Picard,<br>
    Marouk, and Brull in the b.g.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; REV. 10/10/89 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>30B ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> A few yards away, Volnoth passes Yuta, taking a second<br>
    look at her, as if she's vaguely familiar. Yuta looks<br>
    calmly back at him. Volnoth walks off.</p>
  <p> FOLLOW Yuta as she follows Volnoth.</p>
  <p>31 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Yuta turns a corner, is out of sight of Riker and<br>
    the others. She continues walking until she comes<br>
    upon:</p>
  <p>32 ANGLE ON VOLNOTH</p>
  <p> alone, warming his hands over a fire pit.</p>
  <p> YUTA (O.S.)<br>
    You are of the clan Lornack.</p>
  <p> VOLNOTH<br>
    (crossly)<br>
    So?</p>
  <p> Volnoth looks up as Yuta steps into the firelight. He<br>
    scowls.</p>
  <p> VOLNOTH (cont'd)<br>
    I've seen you before.</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; REV. 10/10/89 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> VOLNOTH<br>
    But it's impossible.</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    No. Look closer.</p>
  <p> Yuta moves closer. She's absolutely calm. Volnoth<br>
    squints at her, confused.</p>
  <p> YUTA (cont'd)<br>
    I am Yuta --</p>
  <p> Yuta reaches out to touch Volnoth's face --</p>
  <p> YUTA (cont'd)<br>
    -- of the clan Tralesta.</p>
  <p>33 CLOSE ON VOLNOTH</p>
  <p> as Yuta's fingertips come in contact with his skin.<br>
    It's a feather-light touch -- but Volnoth's suddenly<br>
    in horrible pain. He opens his mouth to scream --<br>
    nothing comes out but a desperate GASP.</p>
  <p>34 WIDER</p>
  <p> as Volnoth's legs give out; he collapses, writhing in<br>
    pain.</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    I am the last of my line. But<br>
    my clan will outlive yours.</p>
  <p> Volnoth stiffens in agony and dies.</p>

  <p>36 EXT. GATHERER CAMP - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Picard, Brull and Marouk are standing. Riker returns<br>
    to the edge of the group, stands by awaiting orders<br>
    from Picard.</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    (grudgingly)<br>
    Marouk's offer has value...<br>
    still, I'm not sure...</p>
  <p> In the b.g., Yuta rejoins the bodyguard, Riker, Troi,<br>
    Worf, and the other Gatherers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (trying to pin him down)<br>
    But you agree it's worth<br>
    presenting to your leader.</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    (more decisive)<br>
    Chorgan is a better judge of such<br>
    things... I will go to him... you<br>
    will hear from me in twenty days.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Brull, in twenty days, I hope to<br>
    be... very far away from here.</p>
  <p> That has a couple levels of meaning...</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    With all due respect, Brull, I<br>
    would like to make the offer to<br>
    Chorgan myself.</p>
  <p> Brull grunts, well, maybe... Picard seizes it and<br>
    motions for Riker and the others to join him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; - REV. 10/11/89 - ACT THREE 23A.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We will gladly take you with<br>
    us aboard the Enterprise. It will<br>

  <p> BRULL<br>
    I'll come alone. If this is a<br>
    trap --</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    It isn't.</p>
  <p> Brull nods sourly as if he's not a hundred percent convinced.<br>
    He turns to the other Gatherers:</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    Mallon -- you'll take charge while<br>
    I'm gone. If I don't return in<br>
    ten days --</p>
  <p> TEMAREK (O.S.)<br>
    Brull!</p>

  <p>37 ANGLE - THE SECLUDED AREA</p>
  <p> where Volnoth was killed. Temarek is leaning over the<br>
    corpse of Volnoth. Brull ENTERS, followed by Picard,<br>
    Riker, and Marouk. Troi, Worf, and the others<br>
    approach, but keep in the b.g.</p>

    Away team to Enterprise. Medical<br>
    Emergency.</p>
  <p>37B WIDER</p>
  <p> Brull looks at Riker curiously --</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    Volnoth was an old man. There's<br>
    nothing to be done.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There's a chance our doctors can<br>
    do something...</p>
  <p> Brull shrugs -- &quot;why bother?&quot;</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    (to Temarek)<br>
    You found him?</p>
  <p> TEMAREK<br>
    Yes. And there are no other<br>
    members of the Lornack clan<br>
    here... so I claim his<br>
    possessions.</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    (a formality)<br>

    Have you no respect for the dead?</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    What's there to respect about a<br>
    corpse?</p>
  <p> Marouk looks helplessly to Picard -- how can you deal<br>
    with such barbarians? She walks away. Beverly<br>
    MATERIALIZES. Moves quickly to scan the body... Riker<br>
    has to push Temarak, who is stripping the corpse, out<br>
    of the way. She shakes her head.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He's been dead too long.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Cardiac arrest...</p>
  <p> But there's a look, an edge to her voice... she stands<br>
    and Temerek goes back at the body... Riker moves with<br>
    out of earshot of the others...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You don't sound convinced.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No, it was a heart attack, all<br>
    right. But I can't figure out<br>

  <p> Alone at a secluded table in b.g. is Wesley, doing<br>
    homework on a PADD. He's got his feet up, has a goodly<br>
    supply of snack food at hand (can't study without<br>
    munchies).</p>
  <p> Yuta pours a bit more Acamarian brandy for Marouk and<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    For centuries, my planet was in<br>
    chaos. Loyalty to one's clan was<br>
    absolute, and the slightest injury<br>
    to one member demanded violent<br>
    retaliation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And these blood feuds could last<br>
    for decades?</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    The obsession for vengeance would<br>
    be passed on from generation to<br>
    generation. And with each act<br>
    of retribution, the violence would<br>
    escalate...</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's not unlike the history of<br>
    my own planet, Marouk.</p>
  <p> In b.g., Riker and Troi ENTER, cross to a table. Yuta<br>
    sees, politely approaches Marouk:</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    Your pardon, Sovereign; may I be<br>
    excused briefly? Commander Riker<br>
    requested I prepare him an<br>
    Acamarian dish.</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    Of course, Yuta.</p>
  <p> Yuta moves off, EXITS -- just as Brull ENTERS. Brull<br>
    crosses toward the bar.</p>
  <p>42A ANGLE ON THE BAR</p>
  <p> as a bartender hands Brull a drink. Brull takes a<br>
    slug, looks around, sees Wesley in the corner, starts<br>
    toward him.</p>
  <p>43 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Brull steps up to Wesley's table, sits down, helps<br>
    himself to some of Wesley's snacks. Wesley's taken<br>
    aback, but tries to be polite.</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    What are you doing?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; REV. 10/9/89 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    My studies.</p>
  <p> Brull picks the PADD out of Wesley's hands, inspects<br>
    it. It's covered with complex equations.</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    What is this?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Math.</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    I can see that. What's it mean?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's the locally Euclidean<br>
    metrization of a k-fold<br>
    contravariant Riemannian tensor<br>
    field.</p>
  <p> Brull nods as if he knows what Wesley's talking about.</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    You good at it?</p>
  <p> Wesley shrugs noncommittally. He's getting impatient<br>
    with Brull. Brull picks up on it:</p>
  <p> BRULL (cont'd)<br>
    You don't like me.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I didn't say --</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    (cutting him)<br>
    That's no problem. I have many<br>
    friends that don't like me.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    What do you know about me?</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You're a thief.</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    I do it to survive -- not because<br>
    I enjoy it.</p>
  <p> Brull looks challengingly at Wesley. Wesley, not<br>
    wanting to get into an argument, avoids Brull's gaze.</p>
  <p> BRULL (cont'd)<br>
    And we Gatherers value freedom.<br>
    We do as we want and answer to<br>
    no creature.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (curious)<br>
    But you're helping Sovereign<br>
    Marouk to change all that...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; REV. 10/9/89 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    Maybe I just want something<br>
    better... for me, and for my<br>
    children.</p>
  <p> Wesley's surprised. Brull doesn't exactly look like<br>
    a father figure.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You have children?</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Two sons. One's almost your age.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    He's not so good at math.</p>
  <p> Wesley smiles; maybe this guy isn't such a bad guy.</p>
  <p>43A ANGLE ON RIKER AND TROI</p>
  <p> in quiet conversation. Yuta steps up, carrying a tray<br>
    with a covered plate. Riker smiles.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Parthus a la Yuta?</p>
  <p> Yuta nods modestly.</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    With the help of one of your food<br>
    stations.</p>
  <p> Yuta sets the tray on a table, unveils the dish, hands<br>
    forks to Riker and Troi. They taste the dish and are<br>
    impressed.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's wonderful.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; REV. 10/9/89 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>43A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Truly excellent.</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Will you join us?</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    I don't want to intrude...</p>
  <p> Troi gets to her feet, offers Yuta her chair.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Not at all; I was just about to<br>
    leave. Please -- sit down.</p>
  <p> Yuta takes Troi's seat. Troi smiles a knowing smile at<br>
    Riker, then EXITS. Riker takes another forkful.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It really is delicious.</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    I am glad it pleases you,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm not your commander. My name<br>
    is William.</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    I will call you William if you<br>
    prefer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I do. You say &quot;Commander&quot; to me<br>
    the same way you say &quot;Sovereign&quot;<br>
    to Marouk.</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    (understands)<br>
    As a servant.</p>
  <p> Riker nods as he takes another bite.</p>

  <p>43A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> YUTA (cont'd)<br>
    You're an excellent commander,<br>
    but you'd make a poor sovereign.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why's that? Not that I<br>
    disagree...</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    You're not comfortable with<br>
    servants.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No. I prefer the company of<br>
    equals.</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    So you treat me as an equal.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And you're not comfortable with<br>
    that?</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    I'm not used to it. I've always<br>
    been a servant. I'm not<br>
    complaining -- the sovereign<br>
    treats me well. I have all that<br>
    I could want.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What about freedom?</p>
  <p> A long beat. Yuta's expression turns melancholy,<br>
    fatalistic.</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    I can never have that.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're the property of the<br>
    sovereign?</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    No. I'm not her slave. I can<br>
    leave whenever I wish.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (a guess)<br>
    But you have no place to go?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; REV. 10/9/89 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>43A CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    Just the opposite. My path is<br>
    all too clear.</p>
  <p> Yuta falls silent. Riker attempts to lighten the<br>
    moment:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yuta, you're an excellent cook,<br>
    but you talk in riddles.</p>
  <p> Yuta smiles without humor.</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    I've never been very good at<br>
    conversation.</p>
  <p> Yuta looks over at Marouk in the b.g. Marouk's smiling<br>
    as she watches Yuta. It makes Yuta self-conscious.</p>
  <p> YUTA (cont'd)<br>
    I think the sovereign wants me<br>
    to return. Enjoy the Parthus.</p>
  <p> Yuta crosses back to Marouk's table. Riker watches<br>
    her go, then returns to his meal. After a beat, his<br>
    communicator BEEPS.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Sickbay to Commander Riker. I've<br>

  <p> Beverly is frowning with concentration as she works<br>
    at a computer station. Riker ENTERS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Doctor, you're scowling.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm thinking.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The old Gatherer on the planet?<br>
    I've found what caused his heart<br>
    attack.</p>
  <p> Beverly indicates the computer monitor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (cont'd)<br>
    The medical tricorder almost<br>
    missed it, but there was a<br>
    microvirus in his body... it<br>
    attached to parasympathetic<br>
    nerves and acted as a<br>
    cholinesterase inhibitor, blocking<br>
    autonomic nerve impulses.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    And that stopped his heart?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (nods)<br>
    But here's the interesting part.<br>
    The microvirus will only attach<br>
    to cells which contain a very<br>
    specific DNA sequence.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How specific?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Without knowing more about their<br>
    genetic makeup, I can't be sure...<br>
    but my guess is, this virus would<br>
    only kill one Acamarian in a<br>
    million.</p>
  <p> Riker WHISTLES.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's an awfully single-minded<br>
    bug.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Too single-minded. I can't<br>
    believe it's a naturally occurring<br>
    virus.</p>
  <p> Riker sees where this is leading:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Meaning somebody engineered it...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Meaning Volnoth was murdered.</p>

    Sir, Acamar Three has agreed to<br>

  <p> RIKER (cont'd)<br>

  <p> Yuta ENTERS, stops just inside the door.</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    I'm disturbing you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not at all.</p>
  <p> Yuta steps forward. The door closes.</p>
  <p> YUTA<br>
    As the sovereign has no further<br>
    need of my services this evening,<br>
    she suggested I might spend some<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    What a charming suggestion...</p>

    Chorgan. May I introduce<br>
    Sovereign Marouk.</p>
  <p> The two leaders acknowledge each other with a slight<br>
    nod. Chorgan wants to control the meeting.</p>
  <p> CHORGAN<br>
    You may sit.</p>
  <p> Marouk waits for her bodyguard to pull the chair for<br>
    her, then sits as if she owned the chair. Picard waits<br>
    for her to sit, then takes the other chair. Brull<br>
    stands to one side while Yuta, carrying a small bag,<br>
    remains in the b.g.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Chorgan)<br>
    I think you will find Marouk's<br>
    proposal --</p>
  <p> CHORGAN<br>
    You know, Picard -- I could take<br>
    you prisoner.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; - REV. 10/12/89 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard looks at him evenly, is determined to get on<br>
    with the business at hand. Chorgan smiles, backing<br>
    down.</p>
  <p> CHORGAN<br>
    Don't worry, I've no intention<br>
    of doing so. You've gone to a<br>
    lot of trouble to get here -- I'm<br>
    curious why.</p>
  <p> Picard was never worried. Shrewdly, he allows Chorgan<br>
    to save face:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then let's proceed.</p>
  <p> Marouk smiles, having not missed a beat of the<br>
    dynamics.</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    Quite simply, I propose amnesty<br>
    for every Gatherer...</p>
  <p> CHORGAN<br>
    Amnesty. You mean slavery.</p>
  <p> BRULL<br>
    Chorgan, if you want to know what<br>
    I think...</p>
  <p> CHORGAN<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    I don't.<br>
    (to Marouk)<br>
    Say what you came to say. But<br>
    I tell you right now I doubt that<br>
    I'll believe it.</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I didn't believe this very<br>
    persuasive Federation captain<br>
    when he suggested that we could<br>
    reconcile our differences. But<br>
    I am convinced now it is the right<br>
    thing not just for you, but for<br>
    us too. We need you back.</p>
  <p> And Picard looks at Marouk with appreciation... as<br>
    Chorgan grumps.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; - REV. 10/12/89 - ACT FOUR 44A.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Marouk turns, indicates Yuta:</p>
  <p>53A ANGLE ON YUTA</p>
  <p> quietly opening her bag, withdrawing a decanter of<br>
    brandy, and moving toward Chorgan.</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    I've brought some Acamarian<br>
    brandy... I'm sure it's been a<br>
    long time...</p>
  <p>53B NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Chorgan barely looks at Yuta and the brandy, waves her<br>
    off rudely. Yuta patiently returns to her place near<br>
    Marouk. There will be other opportunities.</p>
  <p> CHORGAN<br>
    You have spent a century hunting<br>
    us down --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    She's trying to put an end to<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> CHORGAN<br>
    By luring us back and putting us<br>
    in prisons.</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    No -- by accepting you back as<br>
    free men.</p>
  <p> CHORGAN<br>
    (sarcastic)<br>
    And will you feed and clothe us,<br>
    too?</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    (sharply)<br>
    No, of course I won't!<br>
    (gaining control)<br>
    What I will do is give you the<br>
    means to feed and clothe<br>
    yourselves. We've already set<br>
    aside land you can...</p>
  <p> CHORGAN<br>
    Do we look like farmers to you?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; - REV. 10/12/89 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>53B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    Then don't farm. Use the land<br>
    as you wish. It is yours. And<br>
    the moment you set foot on it,<br>
    you'll be better off than you are<br>
    today. You won't be running any<br>
    longer...</p>
  <p> CHORGAN<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We would need autonomy...</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let us acknowledge, Sovereign,<br>
    that Chorgan appears willing to<br>
    discuss your offer...</p>
  <p>53C ON YUTA</p>
  <p> In the b.g., biding her time.</p>
  <p> MAROUK (O.S.)<br>
    There are many levels of autonomy,<br>
    certainly your region would have<br>
    home rights...</p>
  <p> CHORGAN (O.S.)<br>
    Those rights will be spelled out<br>
    before I agree to anything...</p>

  <p> Riker joins her as she punches up the record. Text<br>

    Chorgan with his Gatherer guard and Brull standing<br>

    The discussion is heated:</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    Three seats on the ruling council?</p>
  <p> CHORGAN<br>
    If we're going to be subject to<br>
    your laws, we want a part in<br>

  <p> MAROUK<br>
    I agree you're entitled to<br>
    representation... but not on the<br>
    ruling council.</p>
  <p> CHORGAN<br>
    Unacceptable. The real power is<br>
    in the council. You're trying<br>
    to shut us out already --</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>
    No -- you're trying to take too<br>
    much! No group has three seats<br>
    on the council.</p>
  <p> CHORGAN<br>
    (heating up)<br>
    I don't care what others have --</p>
  <p> MAROUK<br>

    Yes -- you only care about what<br>
    you can take.</p>
  <p> Picard steps in to cool things down:</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> MAROUK<br>
    You're right, Captain.<br>
    (to Chorgan)<br>

  <p>71 CLOSE ON RIKER</p>
  <p> His haunted expression tells us he hasn't heard a word<br>
    of Chorgan's...</p>

  <p>74 INT. TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> Riker's sitting alone at the bar, gazing into an<br>
    untouched drink in front of him. Picard ENTERS.<br>
    takes a beat to study him, then proceeds to sit down<br>
    next to him. After a beat, Riker glances up, knows<br>
    why the captain is there, nods an acknowledgement...<br>
    there's not a lot of eye contact.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    New orders from Starfleet.</p>
  <p> Riker cocks his brow.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The rendezvous with the Goddard<br>
    has been postponed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And in the meantime?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Starbase three four three. We're<br>
    to take on medical supplies for<br>
    the Alpha Leonis system.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sounds pretty routine.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    With the Gatherer truce in effect,<br>
    it should be.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    We won't require a full ship's<br>
    complement. I'm going to extend<br>
    shore leave on the starbase to<br>
    anyone who wants it.</p>
  <p> Riker gives Picard a long look, appreciating what<br>
    Picard's taking pains not to say...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll pass that along to the crew,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard nods, takes his leave of Riker, EXITS.</p>

  <p>75 ON RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> a beat as he stands, crosses to a food slot.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Parthus. A la Yuta.</p>
  <p> As the dish MATERIALIZES, we:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
