  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> In orbit. Another starship, transport class, has<br>
    joined them.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43997.6.<br>
    Admiral Hanson and Lieutenant<br>
    Commander Shelby of Starfleet<br>
    Tactical have arrived to review<br>
    the disappearance of New<br>
    Providence colony. No sign<br>
    remains of the nine hundred<br>
    inhabitants.</p>
  <p>6 INT. CAPT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Hanson -- fifties, high ranking, hard<br>
    driving -- and Shelby. She is late twenties, very<br>
    beautiful, energetic, extremely motivated and<br>
    ambitious. The mood is somber.</p>
  <p> HANSON<br>
    The truth is... hell, we're not<br>
    ready. We've known they were<br>
    coming for over a year... we've<br>
    thrown every resource we've got<br>
    into this but still...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then, you're convinced it is the<br>
    Borg... ?</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    That's what I'm here to find out.<br>
    The initial descriptions of these<br>
    surface conditions are almost<br>
    identical to your reports from<br>
    system J-two-five.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    Mister Riker wrote those<br>
    reports... he agrees with you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; - REV. 4/6/90 - ACT ONE 4.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> HANSON<br>
    (setting protocol)<br>
    Commander Shelby took over Borg<br>
    tactical analysis six months ago.<br>
    I've learned to give her a wide<br>
    latitude when I want to get things<br>
    done... That's how I intend to<br>
    operate here.</p>
  <p> It is clear that she's in charge as far as the admiral<br>
    is concerned.</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    My priority has been to develop<br>
    some kind, any kind of defense<br>
    strategy...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Obviously nothing we have now can<br>
    stop them.</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    We've been designing new<br>
    weapons... but they're still on<br>
    the drawing board.</p>
  <p> HANSON<br>
    We expected much more lead time.<br>
    Your encounter with the Borg was<br>
    over seven thousand light years<br>
    away...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If this is the Borg, it would<br>
    indicate they have a source of<br>
    power far superior to our own...</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    I'd like to see the colony site<br>
    as soon as possible, Captain.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It'll be night at the site in<br>
    thirty minutes. We've scheduled<br>
    an away team for dawn.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Why don't you show the commander<br>
    to her quarters...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; - REV. 4/6/90 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Riker rises to escort her to the door...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's our poker night, Admiral.<br>
    There's always an open seat for<br>
    you...</p>
  <p> HANSON<br>
    (would love to, but... )<br>
    Next time, Commander. Your<br>
    captain and I have a lot to cover.<br>
    But rumor has it that Commander<br>
    Shelby's played a hand or two...</p>
  <p> Riker reacts, exchanges a look with Shelby who grins<br>
    as they EXIT. Hanson smiles. After the door closes...</p>
  <p> HANSON<br>
    Keep your eye on her, Jean-Luc.<br>
    One impressive young lady...</p>
  <p> Picard grins, obviously has a special affection for<br>
    this particular admiral.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You seem rather taken with her,<br>
    J.P.</p>
  <p> HANSON<br>
    Just an old man's fantasies. When<br>
    Shelby came into tactical, every<br>
    damned admiral's uncle had a take<br>
    on this Borg business... she cut<br>
    through it, put us on track.</p>
  <p> Picard moves to a teapot, pouring...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Earl Grey?</p>
  <p> HANSON<br>
    Four sugars.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    She'd make you a hell of a first<br>
    officer.</p>
  <p> Picard raises an eyebrow...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I already have a hell of a first<br>
    officer.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; - REV. 4/6/90 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> HANSON<br>
    Don't tell me he's gonna pass up<br>
    another commission?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    One's available?</p>
  <p> HANSON<br>
    The Melbourne. It's his if he<br>
    wants it. Hasn't he told you?</p>
  <p> Picard sighs, shakes his head, no... resigned to the<br>
    inevitable.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, I guess I knew this day<br>
    would have to come... he'll make<br>
    a fine captain, J.P.</p>
  <p> HANSON<br>
    You may want to tell him that.<br>
    (off Picard's look)<br>
    We're still waiting for his<br>
    decision. Hell, this is the third<br>
    time we've pulled out the<br>
    captain's chair for Riker. He<br>
    just won't sit down. And I'll<br>
    tell you something -- there are<br>
    a lot of young hotshots like<br>
    Shelby on their way up. Riker<br>
    could suddenly look like he's<br>
    standing still next to them. He's<br>
    hurting his career by staying put.<br>
    If I were you, I'd kick him in<br>
    the rear end for his own good.</p>
  <p> As he drinks again, Picard reacts and...</p>
  <p>7 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Riker moving with Shelby.</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    We know the Borg have no interest<br>
    in power or political conquest...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    They identify what's useful to<br>
    them, then consume it. Or try<br>
    to at least...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; - REV. 4/6/90 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> At her quarters, they pause...</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    But here's the question -- after<br>
    they take what they want... what<br>
    happens to the rest?<br>
    (off his look)<br>
    There has to be some evidence...<br>
    residue... something that tells<br>
    us they've been here.</p>
  <p>8 INT. SHELBY'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> As the door slides open and they ENTER.</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    I don't know exactly what I'm<br>
    looking for... but we've tested<br>
    the sections of the Enterprise's<br>
    hull that were damaged by the<br>
    Borg. There were some unusual<br>
    magnetic-resonance traces...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A Borg footprint?</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    That's my theory. I'll see if<br>
    it holds up tomorrow.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I've reviewed your personnel...<br>
    I'll be assigning Mister La Forge<br>
    and Mister Data to accompany me<br>
    on the away team...</p>
  <p> Riker barely reacts... isn't prepared to allow her to<br>
    make crew assignments...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've... already assigned them to<br>
    the away team, Commander. And<br>
    I'll be with you as well.</p>
  <p> A quick awkwardness.</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Of course. I appreciate any<br>
    assistance you can offer.</p>
  <p> She measures him for a beat. Examining the quarters---</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; - REV. 4/6/90 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    Tell me, something, Commander...<br>
    is serving aboard the Enterprise<br>
    as extraordinary an experience<br>
    as I've heard?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Every bit of it.</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    Good.<br>
    (intimately sharing a<br>
    secret)<br>
    Because I intend to convince<br>
    Captain Picard that I'm the right<br>
    choice for the job.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Job? Which job... ?</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    Yours, of course.<br>
    (off his look,<br>
    &quot;embarrassed&quot;)<br>
    I'm sorry... I heard you were<br>
    leaving.</p>
  <p> And she's very good -- it could be taken as an innocent<br>
    faux pas by a lesser man, but Riker knows a fishing<br>
    expedition when he sees one... their eyes connect, he<br>
    won't bite...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If I am... I'm sure you'll be the<br>
    first to know, Commander.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Poker's at seventeen hundred<br>
    hours, my quarters, deck eight...</p>
  <p> He EXITS. Hold just a beat on her reaction and...</p>
  <p>8A INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS - POKER TABLE</p>
  <p> Troi is the dealer, Wesley, Geordi, Riker, Data,<br>
    Shelby... five card stud... four cards have been dealt.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will buy another card,<br>
    Counselor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; - REV. 4/6/90 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>8A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Throws a pair of chips in...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Got another king in the hole,<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am afraid I cannot answer that<br>
    Wesley. And as you are a newcomer<br>
    to the game, may I say it is<br>
    inappropriate to ask.</p>
  <p> Troi deals Data his last card.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No help there.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (bad night)<br>
    Fold. Again.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm in.</p>
  <p> Throws in his chips. His card is a third jack.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Three jacks looking back for the<br>
    handsome young ensign.</p>
  <p> Reactions around the table. Data folds.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Beginner's luck.</p>
  <p> Shelby puts her chips out... gets a worthless card.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Pair of deuces stands.</p>
  <p> Riker throws in his chips... gets a card that continues<br>
    his straight flush... reactions.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Possible flush, possible straight<br>
    flush. The bet is yours, Mister<br>
    Crusher.</p>
  <p> Wes looks nervously at Riker.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm in for ten...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; - REV. 4/9/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>8A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> He throws in a pair of chips. Shelby studies Wesley<br>
    carefully... and then throws in her two chips to stay<br>
    in. But the tension is clearly between Riker and<br>
    Wesley. Riker gives him his best poker face.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    Time to put on the long pants,<br>
    Wes. I'll see your ten. And<br>
    raise you a hundred.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    He's got the straight flush.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Not necessarily. Commander Riker<br>
    may be bluffing, Wesley.</p>
  <p> Wes studies Riker's face. Breaks...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I don't think so. I fold.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (groans)<br>
    With three jacks?<br>
    (shakes his head)<br>
    Wesley, you may get straight A's<br>
    in school, but you've still got<br>
    a little to learn about poker...</p>
  <p> And so the attention turns to Shelby... who looks at<br>
    Riker and they look at each other and after a long look<br>
    beat...</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    I've only got two pair, Commander.<br>
    But I've got to see that blind<br>
    card. I'll call.</p>
  <p> She puts in her chips. Riker blinks... looks down at<br>
    his card... turns it over. It busts his straight<br>
    flush. He's bluffing. Reactions. Wesley groans,<br>
    hangs his head.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (delighted)<br>
    You got him!</p>
  <p> Riker and Shelby's eyes meet. She collects the<br>
    winnings.</p>

    Sir, Captain Picard has been<br>

    Altered... ?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He is a Borg, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts, stunned.</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    We'll go back... I need more<br>
    people... we need to retune the<br>
    phasers again... we'll get him<br>
    out of there...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Commander, reading subspace field<br>
    fluctuations within the Borg ship.<br>
    Looks like they're regenerating...<br>
    restoring power. They could be<br>
    capable of warp any minute.</p>
  <p> Riker's mind working... covering the options...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is the deflector ready?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    the pending decision)<br>
    Ready, sir.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is our only chance to destroy<br>
    them... if they get back into warp,<br>
    our weapon becomes useless.</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    We'll go back... we'll sabotage<br>
    them again if we have to...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (shakes his head)<br>
    We can't maintain pursuit. We<br>
    don't have the power.<br>

    Prepare to fire.</p>
  <p> SHELBY<br>
    At least consult with Starfleet<br>

    Get Admiral Hanson on subspace...</p>

    I am Locutus of Borg. Resistance<br>
