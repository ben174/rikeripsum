    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise in orbit around a planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43510.7.<br>
    The Enterprise has put in at Rutia<br>
    Four to deliver medical supplies<br>
    following an outbreak of violent<br>
    protests.</p>
  <p>2 EXT. PLAZA - DAY - ESTABLISHING</p>
  <p> Shops, a cafe, people strolling. A modern community.<br>
    Beverly, Data and Worf are walking through the plaza.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Although non-aligned, the planet<br>
    has enjoyed a long trading<br>
    relationship with the Federation.</p>
  <p> Beverly spots the cafe, and stops.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We've still got a few minutes<br>
    before our next meeting...</p>
  <p> Worf scans the plaza. Everything seem calm. They<br>
    ENTER, and seat themselves at a table.</p>
  <p> A WAITER stands by the door staring intently into the<br>
    plaza. He does not acknowledge the presence of the<br>
    Starfleet officers. Beverly is becoming annoyed, she<br>
    lifts her hand, signalling for service.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Excuse me --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The High Ground&quot; - REV. 11/6/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Suddenly, a bomb EXPLODES destroying a shop...<br>
    wounding several passers-by... people react, scared,<br>
    running...</p>
  <p> QUICK PAN TO:</p>
  <p>3 INT. INDOOR/OUTDOOR CAFE</p>
  <p> DATA, WORF, BEVERLY at a table... already reacting,<br>
    Beverly on her feet, moving to help... Worf concerned<br>
    for her safety...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Doctor...</p>
  <p> She ignores him, moves into the plaza... From outside<br>
    they HEAR SCREAMS and CRIES, and the WAILING of an<br>
    alert. Worf and Data are moving after her... behind<br>
    them, at the door, the waiter watches with interest,<br>
    also moves outside...</p>
  <p>4 EXT. PLAZA</p>
  <p> A scene of chaos. Shattered glass lies glittering on<br>
    the pavement. Dust and debris from the explosion is<br>
    settling. A jet of some escaping gas pours from a<br>
    broken pipe. Three people are down, all of them<br>
    showing blood.</p>
  <p>5 ANGLE - TWO POLICEMEN</p>
  <p> ENTER. Beverly starts to move to the first victim, but<br>
    an officer draws a phaser, and blocks her way.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Put that thing away. I'm a<br>
    doctor.</p>
  <p> Beverly isn't waiting for permission. She shoulders<br>
    past him. Beverly drops down next to a casualty, pulls<br>
    out her tricorder and examines him...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Just lie still... don't try to<br>
    move...</p>
  <p> Turning to Worf and Data --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The High Ground&quot; - REV. 11/8/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Lieutenant, I need bandages...<br>
    Disinfectant... something with<br>
    alcohol in it ...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Doctor, it is not safe...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's an order, Mister Worf...</p>
  <p> Worf hesitates only briefly, exchanging a glance with<br>
    Data, goes toward the restaurant... as she moves to<br>
    look at another victim...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There's a lot of bleeding, but<br>
    it's not as bad as it looks.<br>
    Don't be afraid.</p>
  <p> The policeman looks at Data...</p>
  <p> POLICEMAN<br>
    The Klingon is right. These<br>
    Ansata... they're madmen... there<br>
    could be another bomb.<br>
    (to the others)<br>
    Clear this area. Everyone out<br>
    of the plaza.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor, a return to the Enterprise<br>
    would be prudent.</p>
  <p> She just looks at him, continues her work.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This planet does have<br>
    physicians...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Who aren't here yet. I am.</p>
  <p> Worf comes back out of the restaurant with some<br>
    ripped-up tablecloths, some liquor bottles... he's<br>
    helped by the waiter who crosses to Beverly... as she<br>
    takes the materials, immediately begins to utilize them<br>
    in emergency care... she barely glances up at the<br>
    waiter who is interested in what she's doing... a<br>
    throwaway line --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The High Ground&quot; - REV. 11/8/89 - TEASER 3A.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> WAITER<br>
    Not at all, Doctor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The High Ground&quot; - 11/3/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> He moves away... takes a beat at the entrance to the<br>
    cafe to look back again, thoughtfully, then enters...</p>
  <p>6 ANOTHER ANGLE - DATA</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, there has been an<br>
    incident.</p>
  <p> INTERCUT TO:</p>
  <p>7 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker at their usual stations.<br>
    Supernumeraries at Conn and Ops.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... A bomb has been detonated by<br>
    the Ansata terrorists.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your security status?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Vulnerable, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Transporter Room Three, lock onto<br>
    the away team, prepare to beam<br>
    them back...</p>
  <p> ENGINEER'S VOICE<br>
    Yes, Captain.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, I recommended such a course,<br>
    but there are several wounded<br>
    people and Doctor Crusher...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (frowns, interrupting)<br>
    Yes, I understand. Picard to<br>
    Doctor Crusher...</p>
  <p>8 ANGLE ON BEVERLY</p>
  <p> keys her insignia... continues to work...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The High Ground&quot; - REV. 11/6/89 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Go ahead.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've been advised of your<br>
    situation by Mister Data.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I already know what you're going<br>
    to say.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (annoyed)<br>
    Doctor, will you at least allow<br>
    me to...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The longer we argue, the<br>
    longer...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are endangering yourself and<br>
    the away team...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain, right now, I'm trying<br>
    to pull a life back into a wounded<br>
    body with brandy and sleight of<br>
    hand. I'm not going anywhere...<br>
    Data and Worf don't have to stay.<br>
    Crusher out.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Transporter Room, do you have lock<br>
    on the away team?</p>
  <p> ENGINEER'S VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir. Shall I transport them?</p>
  <p> Picard looks in frustration to Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I wouldn't want to be in the<br>
    Transporter Room to greet her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Picard to Data. Hold your<br>
    position until the Rutian medics<br>
    arrive.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The High Ground&quot; - 11/3/89 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye, Captain.</p>
  <p> END INTERCUT.</p>
  <p>9 EXT. PLAZA</p>
  <p> The WAILING of emergency vehicles is much closer.<br>
    Beverly continues to treat the wounded. Worf is<br>
    running tricorder scans of the buildings. Data moves<br>
    to him...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The tricorder is not reading any<br>
    other explosive devices in this<br>
    vicinity...</p>
  <p>10 ANGLE - AN WOMAN IN AUTHORITY (ALEXANA)</p>
  <p> arrives, accompanied by security guards... glances at<br>
    Data and Worf as she passes... examines the scene...</p>
  <p>11 ANGLE - THE WAITER</p>
  <p> moves barely outside the door of the restaurant to<br>
    watch...</p>
  <p>12 THE SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as an extraordinary arc of light appears...<br>
    simultaneous with his arrival is a SOUND like lighting<br>
    finding ground. A CRACK of almost concussive<br>
    proportions. A MAN who seems to literally appear out<br>
    of the light. He wears a shoulder device. And he<br>
    looks to be in definite pain as he arrives. People<br>
    begin running ... because it is nothing new... in<br>
    quick cuts --</p>
  <p>13 DATA AND WORF</p>
  <p> react...</p>
  <p>14 ALEXANA</p>
  <p> is shielded by her guards...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The High Ground&quot; - REV. 11/6/89 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>15 BEVERLY</p>
  <p> turns and finds the man inches away... she recoils, but<br>
    the man catches her by the arm.</p>
  <p>16 ANGLE - A GUARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> goes for his weapon, and the terrorist shoots from the<br>
    hip killing the guard. The terrorist strengthens his<br>
    hold on Beverly as...</p>
  <p>17 DATA AND WORF</p>
  <p> reach for their phasers... they don't have a clear shot<br>
    through the crowd... and as they jockey forward for<br>
    position...</p>
  <p>18 BEVERLY AND THE TERRORIST (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You don't understand... I'm a<br>
    doc...</p>
  <p> And then they're gone... VANISHING into a new burst of<br>
    light. On Data and Worf's reaction...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The High Ground&quot; - REV. 11/10/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>19 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> In orbit.</p>
  <p>20 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker listen to Data and Worf's report...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A transporter would leave<br>
    residual ionization in the air...<br>
    but the tricorder readings found<br>
    no trace after the incident...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    People don't just appear and<br>
    disappear... there has to be some<br>
    way to track her...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We have been unable to detect the<br>
    signal from her communicator.<br>
    It has either been deactivated or<br>
    she is being held in a shielded<br>
    location.</p>
  <p> A long beat... Picard angry, deep in thought. Then,<br>
    softly --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why... her?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, I believe she was the<br>
    intended target of the abduction.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why would they want a Federation<br>
    hostage? Their fight doesn't<br>
    involve us.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It does now.</p>
  <p> On reactions...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The High Ground&quot; - REV. 11/6/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>21 INT. CAVERN</p>
  <p> A perimeter of light holds the stygian darkness at<br>
    bay. In some places movable screens augment the<br>
    natural stone wall which have formed to create a<br>
    sense of privacy.</p>
  <p> Beverly is in a secluded area with rock walls on three<br>
    sides. The alcove is furnished simply -- a cot, a<br>
    small table, and a folding chair. Beverly is seated<br>
    on the camp bed. Her hands and ankles have been bound,<br>
    and she shifts uncomfortably. She is angry and afraid,<br>
    and trying to hide it.</p>
  <p> A MAN, KYRIL FINN enters. Beverly swallows hard, lifts<br>
    her chin, and tries to stare him down, but she ends up<br>
    looking only anxious.</p>
  <p> Finn is an attractive man in his early thirties, but<br>
    he has an air of shyness and awkwardness which seems<br>
    out of place with his combat style clothing, and the<br>
    phaser he wears. His hair's a little too long and wavy<br>
    for serious bad-ass. In fact, with his hunch<br>
    shouldered stance and one hand dug deep into his pocket<br>
    he looks like a man trying to be overlooked. In his<br>
    other hand, he has a plate of food.</p>
  <p> FINN<br>
    Are you hungry? Do you want<br>
    something to eat?</p>
  <p> She just stares at him. Scared, doing bravado.</p>
  <p> FINN<br>
    I doesn't matter to me. You<br>
    want to be hungry? Be hungry.</p>
  <p> He sits in front of her... picks at the food, eating<br>
    with his hands...</p>
  <p> FINN<br>
    What's your name?</p>
  <p> No response.</p>
  <p> FINN<br>
    You're a doctor on a Federation<br>
    starship?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I always wondered what it would<br>
    be like to travel across the<br>
    galaxy.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The High Ground&quot; - REV. 11/6/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> FINN (Cont'd)<br>
    (rueful, self-deprecating)<br>
    It's not something I've exactly<br>
    had time for.</p>
  <p> Stonewalling him. He shrugs.</p>
  <p> FINN<br>
    This isn't the best way to meet<br>
    new people, is it?</p>
  <p> He stands.</p>
  <p> FINN<br>
    If you want something, just ask<br>
    for me -- Kyril Finn.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    They know me.</p>
  <p> He EXITS and takes the plate of food with him. As<br>
    he exits, she looks down, angry, helpless...</p>
  <p>22 INT. CAPT. READY ROOM - CLOSE ON WESLEY</p>
  <p> who has just heard the news. Pulling back to reveal...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We have no reason to believe she's<br>
    been hurt in any way...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In fact, it's more likely that<br>
    they will take good care of her...<br>
    if they want to use her as a<br>
    bargaining chip.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (beat)<br>
    A bargaining chip?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The innocent become the pawns in<br>
    a conflict like this, Wesley.</p>
  <p> Picard thinks a beat, stands... begins to move around<br>
    the desk toward Wes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The High Ground&quot; - 11/3/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Ansata separatists have been<br>
    trying for generations to be freed<br>
    from the rule of the Eastern<br>
    Continent. If they can get the<br>
    government to even acknowledge<br>
    their demands, then kidnapping<br>
    your mother will have served a<br>
    purpose.</p>
  <p> He leans on his desk.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That may be what they are after.<br>
    It may not. Frankly, I don't<br>
    care. All I care about is getting<br>
    her back, Wesley... In a few<br>
    minutes, we're leaving to meet<br>
    with the authorities...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Request permission to be on the<br>
    away team, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. You have an important job<br>
    to do here. If we are to find<br>
    your mother, we must have a way<br>
    to trace the movements of these<br>
    terrorists. I want you on the<br>
    team that will investigate this<br>
    new technology of theirs.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I understand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Report to Mister Data. Dismissed.</p>
  <p> He exits. Picard glances at Troi. They share a<br>
    moment. She acknowledges his efforts.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He needs your strength right now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (beat)<br>
    History has shown us that strength<br>
    may be useless in the face of<br>
    terrorism, Counselor.</p>
  <p> Off Troi's reaction...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The High Ground&quot; - REV. 11/7/89 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>23 INT. ALEXANA'S OFFICE - DAY</p>
  <p> Alexana Devos, a striking woman in her late thirties,<br>
    meets with Picard and Riker. (This is the same woman<br>
    we saw in the teaser.) Tall and athletic, she is a<br>
    natural born leader. But she is also a woman under<br>
    great pressure, caught up in a struggle that she's no<br>
    longer sure she can win. Trying to deal with a hundred<br>
    problems at once has left her preoccupied and driven<br>
    and almost burned out. She is sitting down at a desk<br>
    littered with isolinear reader chips. On one wall are<br>
    monitors that provide a running text of current police<br>
    activity. She studies them intently.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What exactly is Ansata policy in<br>
    regard to hostages?</p>

  <p> Alexana removes an armband from a drawer, and tosses<br>
    it onto the desk.</p>

    Not much, really.</p>

  <p> She's looking quite a bit more tired than before. But<br>
    she's still not willing to respond... at least not on<br>
    the first volley.</p>
  <p> He studies her... puts down the plate, moves to her...<br>
    Beverly can't control the impulse. She shrinks back in<br>
    fear.</p>

    Relax, I'm just going to...</p>
  <p> He indicates her bonds. He drops to one knee, and<br>
    releases her ankles. (And note: that despite his<br>
    rumpled, good guy attitude there is a side of this that<br>
    could be considered torture, manipulation, setting up<br>
    dependency.)</p>

    Come on. Eat something. What's<br>
    the point of not eating? You're<br>
    the only one who suffers. Do I<br>

    Okay, it's bothering me.</p>

  <p> For the first time, we see full breadth of the rebel<br>
    camp... as Finn and Beverly move by, a pair of<br>
    children, one watches while the other cleans a<br>
    weapon... people look over at Beverly, exchange looks<br>
    with Finn who nods confidently -- he's got this under<br>
    control.</p>
  <p> He leads her to a section of the cave that has been<br>
    set aside as an infirmary. A section of the cave has<br>
    been set aside as an infirmary. Five patients rest<br>
    on cots. A couple are bandaged, but don't seem to be<br>
    in much distress. The other three are thrashing,<br>
    delirious with pain. One of them is the man who<br>
    kidnapped Beverly. He motions to her -- this is my<br>
    problem... she looks at them with concern... gets down<br>
    on her knees, runs a tricorder scan checks the<br>
    readings... shakes her head...</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're telling me all these people<br>
    belong to the Ansata?</p>
  <p> ALEXANA<br>
    Not really. We suspect the<br>
    organization itself only consists<br>
    of some two hundred members. There<br>
    are over five thousand names on<br>
    this list. Citizens we know to<br>
    be sympathetic to their cause.<br>
    They pass along weaponry and<br>
    information. March in pro-Ansata<br>
    demonstrations... participate in<br>
    general strikes.. or the<br>
    occasional riot.</p>

    I can see where that could affect<br>
    your point of view.</p>
  <p> ALEXANA<br>
    But I guess the event that really<br>
    opened my eyes took place only<br>
    a few days after my arrival. A<br>

  <p>35 INT. CAVERN</p>
  <p> The infirmary. Beverly is trying to ease the three<br>
    patients who are suffering from the dimensional effect.<br>
    She is suffering with them and for them, because<br>
    there's nothing she can do except make them<br>
    comfortable. She administers a hypo to the young<br>
    woman, then sits next to her on the bed, and clasps the<br>
    girl's hand. The terrorist boy is eager to assist.</p>
  <p> Finn is seated on a low rock wall which surrounds the<br>
    infirmary. Beverly is unaware of him for she is intent<br>
    on her patients. He is sketching, but periodically<br>
    he looks up and studies Beverly.</p>
  <p>36 ANGLE ON BEVERLY</p>
  <p> As she becomes aware of the scrutiny. She looks up,<br>
    annoyed, and notices Finn.</p>

  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He is the source of all her troubles, and so frowns,<br>
    but then becomes puzzled at his actions.</p>
  <p> Beverly stands, and circles around the cots and the<br>
    walls to come up behind him.</p>
  <p>37 ANGLE ON - THE SKETCH PAD</p>
  <p> It is a very fine sketch of Beverly's hands clasping<br>
    the girl's.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You should be drawing, not<br>
    killing people.</p>
  <p> FINN<br>
    I can do both.</p>
  <p> And his attitude infuriates her.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How can you have such a casual<br>
    attitude toward killing?</p>
  <p> FINN<br>
    (without humor)<br>
    I take my killing very seriously,<br>
    Doctor.</p>
  <p> She shakes her head, unable to understand this man.</p>
  <p> FINN<br>
    (shrugs her off)<br>
    You are an idealist...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I live in an ideal culture...<br>
    there is no need for your kind<br>
    of violence... we've proven that.</p>
  <p> He looks at her, grunts.</p>

  <p> FINN<br>
    Your origins on Earth are from<br>
    the American continent, are they<br>
    not?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    North America.</p>
  <p> FINN<br>
    I have read your history books.<br>
    This is a war for independence.<br>
    I am no different than your own<br>
    George Washington...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Washington was a military general.<br>
    He was not a terrorist.</p>
  <p> FINN<br>
    Doctor, the difference between<br>
    a general and terrorist is only<br>
    the difference between winners<br>
    and losers. You win, you're<br>
    called a general. You lose...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You are killing innocent people...<br>
    Can't you see the immorality of<br>
    what you're doing... or have you<br>
    killed so often, you've become<br>
    blind to it?</p>
  <p> Finn looks at her, shakes his head at her naivete.</p>
  <p> FINN<br>
    How much innocent blood has been<br>
    spilled for the cause of freedom<br>
    in the history of your Federation,<br>
    Doctor? How many good and noble<br>
    societies have bombed civilians<br>
    in war? Wiped out whole cities.<br>
    And now that you enjoy the comfort<br>
    that has come from their battles,<br>
    their killing... you frown on my<br>
    immorality... ? Doctor, I am<br>
    willing to die for my freedom.<br>
    And, in the finest tradition of<br>
    your own great civilization, I'm<br>
    willing to kill for it too.</p>
  <p> And as he leaves her to think about that...</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>38 INT. ALEXANA'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Riker and Alexana have just finished interviewing one<br>
    of the detainees from the round-up. He stares sullenly<br>
    at them as Alexana dismisses him with:</p>
  <p> ALEXANA<br>
    (curtly)<br>
    All right you can go.</p>
  <p> She nods to one of her security guards who stands<br>
    inside the doorway. The security guard waits for the<br>
    detainee to get out of his chair and then escorts him<br>
    out of the office. This has been going on a long time.</p>
  <p> Riker paces around, tense and frustrated.</p>
  <p> ALEXANA<br>
    If you want, I could become more<br>
    persuasive.</p>
  <p> Riker refuses to even consider it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Alexana nods, accepting, if not totally agreeing with<br>
    his decision.</p>
  <p> The security guard enters with the waiter who is<br>
    nervous but defiant. Seats him. Alexana consults her<br>
    wall screen computer.</p>
  <p> ALEXANA<br>
    You're Katik Shaw, the waiter from<br>
    the Lumar Cafe.<br>
    (he nods)<br>
    You witnessed both the explosion<br>
    and the kidnapping.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The High Ground&quot; - REV. 11/6/89 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KATIK<br>
    I saw nothing.</p>
  <p> Riker's impatience is growing.</p>
  <p> ALEXANA<br>
    We are aware of your ties with<br>
    the Ansata... For all we know<br>
    you planted the bomb yourself...<br>
    Where have they taken her?</p>
  <p> KATIK<br>
    I don't know what you're talking<br>
    about.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've had enough of this.</p>
  <p> Before Alexana can respond, Riker places himself<br>
    between her and the prisoner.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Katik)<br>
    I want you to take a message back<br>
    to your people. Tell them the<br>
    Federation is willing to negotiate<br>
    for the release of Doctor Crusher.</p>
  <p> ALEXANA<br>
    Riker... !</p>
  <p> Riker cuts her off.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    She's a Starfleet officer. That<br>
    makes her my responsibility.</p>
  <p> Alexana's silence is a tacit agreement.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Katik)<br>
    Your side has demands, we're<br>
    willing to listen to them. We<br>
    want her back. It's as simple<br>
    as that.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The High Ground&quot; - REV. 11/7/89 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Katik studies Riker trying to deceive whether there's<br>
    any truth behind the officer's words. After a beat,<br>
    Riker moves away.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing; to Alexana)<br>
    I don't think it's necessary to<br>
    detain this gentleman any longer.</p>
  <p> Katik looks over at Alexana, figures there's no way<br>
    she'll let him go so easily. Alexana glances at Riker<br>
    who is also waiting for her response. Finally she<br>
    breaks the silence.</p>
  <p> ALEXANA<br>
    (to Katik)<br>
    Get out.</p>
  <p> Katik tries to hide his amazement. He hurries out of<br>
    the room before she can change her mind.</p>
  <p> ALEXANA<br>
    I should have him followed, but<br>
    we'll try it your way.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is that what you want?</p>
  <p> She sits down at her desk. Suddenly she seems very<br>
    weary.</p>
  <p> ALEXANA<br>
    What I want is to go home. Back<br>
    to my own country. To leave<br>
    behind the roundups, the<br>
    interrogations, the bodies lying<br>
    in the street. To be able to walk<br>
    without bodyguards, and not have<br>
    to jump at every unexpected noise.<br>
    That's what I want Riker.</p>
  <p> She leans back in her chair, angry.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The High Ground&quot; - REV. 11/6/89 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>39 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard is standing by Data who is working at Science<br>
    One. Supernumeraries at Conn, Ops and Tactical.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The dimensional jump creates a<br>
    subspace pressure modulation,<br>
    Captain. By setting up a<br>
    magnetosphere faint echogram that<br>
    can monitor each of their<br>
    movements, we may be able to<br>
    collect enough data to trace their<br>
    power source.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you estimate the number of<br>
    jumps it will take?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Dimensional shifting is such an<br>
    unstable procedure that I cannot<br>
    say.</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges... as he starts to move away, Data<br>
    continues, stops him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, I am finding it difficult<br>
    to understand many aspects of<br>
    Ansata conduct. Much of their<br>
    behavioral norm would be defined<br>
    by my program as unnecessary and<br>
    unacceptable.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And by my... &quot;program&quot; as well,<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But, if that is so, Captain, why<br>
    are their methods often<br>
    successful?<br>

    I have been reviewing the history<br>
    of armed rebellion and it appears<br>
    that terrorism is an effective<br>
    way to promote political change.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have never subscribed to the<br>
    theory that political power flows<br>
    from the barrel of a gun, Data...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In most instances, you would be<br>
    correct. But there are numerous<br>
    examples where it was<br>
    successful... the independence<br>
    of the Mexican State from Spain,<br>
    the Irish Unification of 2024,<br>
    the Kenzie Rebellion...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, I'm aware of them...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then, would it be accurate to say<br>
    that terrorism is acceptable when<br>
    the options for peaceful<br>
    settlement have been foreclosed?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, we cannot condone violence.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Even in response to violence?</p>
  <p> Picard looks at him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    These are questions that mankind<br>
    has been struggling with since<br>

    Lieutenant Worf is recovering in<br>

    Dead and injured?</p>

    Three dead, four wounded.</p>

    Another millisecond, and there<br>
    would have been a big dust cloud<br>

    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Riker surveys the damage... feels the responsibility.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why. I just asked if they would<br>
    talk...</p>
  <p> ALEXANA<br>
    You have your answer, Riker.</p>
  <p> She gives him a sympathetic look -- we've all got to<br>
    learn the hard way. The anger, the determination grows<br>
    in his eyes.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Sir, the next time the Ansata use<br>
    the dimensional jump we should<br>
    be able to get a fix on their<br>
    power source.</p>
  <p> Riker nods, impatient to move into action.</p>
  <p>59 INT. CAVERN</p>
  <p> Picard is seated on the camp bed. His hands have been<br>
    cuffed behind his back. Beverly is tending his<br>
    battered face. Picard is stunned... impossible to<br>
    believe all this... reliving the nightmare for her...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Worf went down... I don't know<br>
    if he's alive or dead... there<br>
    were other casualties...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Was... Wes... on the bridge...</p>
  <p> He looks at her, sorry he hadn't thought to anticipate<br>
    a mother's fears...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> Her look asks if he's all right... he has no way to<br>
    answer her...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He took cover... I didn't see any<br>
    more than that...<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're getting closer to tracing<br>

    was Wesley who put us onto this<br>
    dimensional jumping of theirs...</p>
  <p> Their eyes meet...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He's been extraordinary throughout<br>
    this. He'll make a fine officer,<br>

    You wouldn't dare.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    repartee, out of left field for this time and place...</p>

    around at his surroundings.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There aren't any exits to the<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then the only way out is by<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    A mode of travel I'd encourage<br>
    you to avoid. It's killing them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They're mad.</p>
  <p> She doesn't answer right away.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    Beverly, I don't have to warn you<br>
    about the psychological impact<br>
    of being a hostage...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I know. I understand that. But<br>
    their leader, Finn, he's not what<br>
    you'd expect...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, he's certainly not what I'd<br>
    expect. Without cause or reason,<br>
    his little band of outlaws has<br>
    attacked my ship...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But he did have reasons... the<br>
    medical supplies, the arrests...<br>
    Jean-Luc, if we really examine<br>
    our role in this...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Beverly, you are arguing for a<br>
    man who may have murdered your<br>
    son.</p>
  <p> And she has to swallow hard and feel where she is and<br>
    she cannot quite touch the ground and it scares the<br>

    (to Picard)<br>
    She wouldn't even tell me her<br>

    &quot;Doctor.&quot; Are you hungry? Do you<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    You've made a grave<br>
    miscalculation...</p>
  <p> FINN<br>
    Oh?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You've assaulted a Federation<br>
    starship, killed and wounded<br>
    members of her crew, kidnapped<br>
    two officers... do you not expect<br>
    a response?</p>
  <p> FINN<br>
    On the contrary, I'm counting on<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You want Federation involvement?</p>
  <p> FINN<br>
    Captain, there's a lot to admire<br>
    in the Federation, but there's<br>
    a hint of moral cowardice in your<br>
    dealings with non-aligned planets.<br>
    You do business with a government<br>
    that's crushing us. And then you<br>
    say you aren't involved. But of<br>
    course you are. You just don't<br>
    want to get dirty.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You accuse us of cowardice while you<br>
    plant bombs in shadows...</p>
  <p> FINN<br>
    I've been fighting the only war<br>
    I can against an intractable<br>
    enemy. Now, I'm fighting a big<br>
    war against a much more powerful<br>
    adversary. Can't you see how that<br>
    helps me?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm afraid I don't.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He has added a chair to the<br>

  <p>60 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> FINN<br>
    You added the chair, Captain.<br>
    I am simply forcing you to sit<br>
    in it. The Federation will<br>
    quickly tire of our little war...<br>
    they will want you back... they<br>
    will want to get as far away from<br>
    Rutia as they can. And I will<br>
    not make it easy. Eventually,<br>
    the Federation will force the<br>
    government to make concessions.<br>
    And then a few more. And then a<br>
    few more.<br>
    (sardonic)<br>
    Until we can finally reach an<br>
    honorable agreement that saves face<br>
    for all sides.<br>

  <p> And Picard studies him... and realizes his scenario is<br>
    very sound. And this is said leader to leader --</p>

  <p> Troi is on her way to her quarters when suddenly there<br>

    pain.</p>
  <p> FINN<br>
    I'm not here to hurt you. Just<br>
    hear what I have to say.</p>
  <p> Troi nods, forcing herself to remain calm. After a<br>
    beat, Red Alert SOUNDS... they know he's there...</p>
  <p> FINN<br>
    Your people are safe. How long<br>
    they stay that way depends on you.<br>
    We demand an embargo and trade<br>
    sanctions levied against Rutia.<br>
    The Federation will blockade the<br>

    (not so sure)<br>
    He could have killed you. He<br>

    one boy putting down a gun.</p>

  <p> The turbolift doors open and in come Picard and<br>
    Beverly, followed by Riker and Worf.</p>
  <p> Wesley and Beverly share a long, loving smile across<br>
    the room. He hurries over. A tight hug.</p>

    Take us out of orbit, Mister<br>
