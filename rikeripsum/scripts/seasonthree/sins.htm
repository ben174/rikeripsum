  <p> STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION <br>
    &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE AND KLINGON SHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The two ships facing each other (STOCK FOOTAGE).</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43685.2<br>
    As part of a continuing exchange<br>
    program, the Enterprise is taking<br>
    aboard a Klingon officer to return<br>
    the recent visit of Commander<br>
    Riker to the cruiser Pagh.</p>
  <p>2 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> PICARD and RIKER are walking along the corridor toward<br>
    the Transporter Room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We must take care that while he<br>
    is with us, Commander Kurn is<br>
    accorded all the rights and<br>
    responsibilities due the first<br>
    officer of this ship. If he<br>
    should feel patronized in any<br>
    way...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'd know about it, sir. One does<br>
    not patronize a Klingon warrior.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm quite sure your experience<br>
    aboard the Pagh will prove<br>
    invaluable during the commander's<br>
    tour. Be sure that the crew is<br>
    prepared for any... unusual<br>
    orders.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Klingons are very thorough,<br>
    Captain. I'm sure Commander Kurn<br>
    has studied for his assignment<br>
    with us just as I studied to serve<br>
    with them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - 1/5/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    I understand that he specifically<br>
    requested the Enterprise...</p>
  <p> Moving into --</p>
  <p>3 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker ENTER. TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN is<br>
    waiting at the console.</p>
  <p> TECHNICIAN<br>
    Commander Kurn is ready for<br>
    transport, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p> The Technician works the console and the Transporter<br>
    EFFECT begins. Kurn materializes on the stage. Kurn<br>
    is clad in full Klingon regalia... he bears a striking<br>
    resemblance to Worf and is about the same age. Picard<br>
    and Riker step forward in greeting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Welcome aboard the Enterprise,<br>
    Commander. I am Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> Kurn steps off the stage. There is a slightly awkward<br>
    moment as Kurn remembers the human custom of greeting.<br>
    He hesitates only briefly and then extends his hand.<br>
    Picard smiles and shakes his hand. Kurn responds<br>
    politely, but it sounds rehearsed and stilted.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Thank... you, Captain. I am ready<br>
    for duty.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is Commander William Riker<br>
    who will be yielding the first<br>
    officer's position to you during<br>
    your tour...</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    You are relieved.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    May I take my station, Captain?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - 1/5/90 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker react to the Klingon's impatience.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I thought that I might show you<br>
    your quarters...</p>
  <p> Riker stops as he sees fire come to Kurn's eyes<br>
    struggling to keep his temper.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I am ready for duty, sir. I ask<br>
    that I be allowed to take my<br>
    station.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker exchange a glance.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well... If you will<br>
    accompany us to the bridge...</p>
  <p> They head for the door. There is a slight moment of<br>
    awkwardness as Riker almost goes through the door ahead<br>
    of Kurn. Riker catches himself and allows Kurn to go<br>
    first. Kurn glares at this near-breach of protocol,<br>
    but says nothing.</p>
  <p>4 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> WESLEY at Conn, WORF at Tactical, DATA in Command. Picard,<br>
    Riker and Kurn ENTER from the turbolift. Picard leads<br>
    Kurn down into the Command area. Everyone watches to<br>
    see the reaction as Worf and Kurn see each other for<br>
    the first time. Worf is uncomfortable. Kurn runs his<br>
    eyes over him... silently taking his measure of Worf...<br>
    then looks away as if he'd seen nothing worth his time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    May I present your bridge crew...</p>
  <p> And it is a question, so Kurn feels free to answer --</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Unnecessary, Captain. I am<br>
    prepared to take command.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    Proceed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - 1/5/90 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (to the crew)<br>
    I am Kurn, commander rank, Klingon<br>
    Defense Force. You will address<br>
    me as &quot;Commander&quot; or &quot;sir&quot; at all<br>
    times.</p>
  <p> Moving about the bridge... making strong, challenging<br>
    eye contact... bellicose...</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    I am fully aware of all Starfleet<br>
    regulations. They will be<br>
    strictly adhered to by all<br>
    personnel while I am in command.<br>
    It is my intention to bring a<br>
    sense of discipline that you may<br>
    not be accustomed to.</p>
  <p> The last is said at Worf... then to Picard --</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    With your permission, of course,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard rather enjoys this, covers it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    By all means, Commander.</p>
  <p> Wesley throws a do-you-believe-this glance to Riker.<br>
    Kurn notices, moves face to face with Wesley...</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Do you wish to speak, Acting<br>
    Ensign Wesley Crusher?</p>
  <p> Wesley is surprised that he knows his name.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Nosir, Commander, sir.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (to the crew)<br>
    I have studied all your service<br>
    records. Impressive. We shall<br>
    see if you live up to your<br>
    reputations. The crew awaits your<br>
    orders, Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - REV. 1/8/90 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard looks around the bridge and sees his crew<br>
    sitting straight, alert, indeed ready. Picard swallows<br>
    a grin and sits in the captain's chair. It takes Kurn<br>
    a couple seconds to realize where his place is, but<br>
    then sits down with confidence in Riker's accustomed<br>
    seat. Riker moves to the seat on the other side of<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (casually)<br>
    Take us into the outer cometary<br>
    cloud, Commander.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (booming)<br>
    Set course one-one-four, mark<br>
    two-three-zero, one-third impulse<br>
    power!</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (works console)<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Execute!<br>
    (Wesley works furiously)<br>
    Execute!</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (a little rattled)<br>
    Engaged. Increasing to one-third<br>
    impulse power, sir.</p>
  <p> Kurn grunts and shakes his head. As Picard sits back,<br>
    even faced, knowing we're in for an interesting ride...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship accelerates to full impulse power.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - 1/5/90 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>7 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS, sees Wesley at a table and goes over to<br>
    him. Wesley is staring into space with a look of<br>
    unhappiness on his face.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mind if I join you?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (sits down)<br>
    Something wrong, Wesley?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Commander Kurn perhaps?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    He... just doesn't seem to like<br>
    me, sir. I can't do anything<br>
    right for him. Every time I<br>
    respond to one of his orders...<br>
    he jumps down my throat. I'm not<br>
    sure what I'm doing wrong.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He's just...</p>
  <p> Riker's voice trails off as he notices that GEORDI has<br>
    just come up to the table looking outraged.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Problem, Geordi?</p>
  <p> Geordi hesitates slightly, he doesn't really want to<br>
    bother Riker with his problems, but he's clearly at the<br>
    end of his rope.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, sir... it's our new first<br>
    officer.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - 1/5/90 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (can't help but smile)<br>
    I take it he found something wrong<br>
    in Engineering?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (exasperated)<br>
    Just the entire section. He made<br>
    a surprise inspection in the<br>
    middle of a maintenance cycle!<br>
    I tried to explain to him, but...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He wouldn't listen.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We're all going to be doing double<br>
    shifts to get things ready for<br>
    the next inspection.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to both of them)<br>
    His style of command is just<br>
    different. Klingons believe in<br>
    a strict formality of command and<br>
    obedience.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But this isn't a Klingon ship.<br>
    He's got to loosen up a little,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's not just us. He's leaning<br>
    pretty hard on everybody except...<br>
    (hesitates)</p>
  <p> Off Riker's look...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Except the one guy who wouldn't<br>
    mind it...</p>
  <p>8 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON WORF</p>
  <p> Kurn in Command, Worf at his station.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sensors picking up asteroidal<br>
    debris ahead, Commander.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - REV. 1/7/90 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Can you identify the coordinates,<br>
    Mister Worf?</p>
  <p> Kurn stands up and moves up the ramp to the Tactical<br>
    station.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Bearing zero-zero-one, mark<br>
    point-oh-three, range three<br>
    hundred thousand kilometers.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Excellent. Please scan the<br>
    asteroid field for me, Lieutenant,<br>
    and report.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Approximately two thousand small<br>
    objects, none in our direct flight<br>
    path, sir.</p>
  <p> Kurn is now standing near Worf. Kurn's attitude is<br>
    easy, gentle, almost as if he thinks he might bruise<br>
    Worf if he isn't careful. As Kurn's manner becomes<br>
    more soothing and polite, Worf slowly begins to<br>
    overheat at this treatment.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    So, no course correction is<br>
    necessary, is that what you're<br>
    saying?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (tightly)<br>
    It should not be needed,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Very good, Lieutenant. You<br>
    handled that well.</p>
  <p> This is too much for Worf. He looks sharply at Kurn.<br>
    Kurn notices... challenging --</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Yes?</p>
  <p> Worf looks away from Kurn... stares straight ahead.<br>
    Kurn studies him for a moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - REV. 1/8/90 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>8AA EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Cruising at one-third impulse.</p>
  <p>8A INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Riker is inside as the door opens and Kurn ENTERS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (greeting)<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> Kurn nods an acknowledgement...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain's mess... ?</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Resume.</p>
  <p> The doors shut and they proceed. A beat of silence<br>
    for a few steps before Riker decides to bring up what's<br>
    been on his mind.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Your knowledge of our systems and<br>
    procedures is very impressive...<br>
    (off his look)<br>
    ...Sir.</p>
  <p> Getting a little tired of this...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I would like to make one<br>
    suggestion, sir.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    A suggestion...</p>
  <p> Friendly, charming --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    When I served aboard the Pagh,<br>
    the hardest part for me was in<br>
    recognizing and adapting to the<br>
    demands of the crew. They needed<br>
    an iron hand. They wanted it.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - REV. 1/8/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>8A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER (Cont'd)<br>
    I can imagine how difficult it<br>
    must be for you to work with a<br>
    crew that is so different. I'd<br>
    be happy to guide you in this<br>
    regard if it would be helpful.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (beat)<br>
    No. It wouldn't.</p>
  <p> The door opens. As Kurn begins to exit...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (a little burned)<br>
    This is not a Klingon ship, sir.</p>
  <p> Kurn pauses, glances threateningly back at Riker --</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    No, Commander, it is not. If it<br>
    were a Klingon ship, I would have<br>
    killed you for offering your...<br>

  <p>8B INT. CAPTAIN'S DINING ROOM - CLOSE ON A ROASTED<br>
    TURKEY (REPLICATED)</p>
  <p> As a hand puts a carving knife to work... and pull back<br>
    to see Picard in a chef's apron, carving at the head of<br>
    an elaborate buffet table. Kurn observes, in line near<br>
    Geordi.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    How long has the bird been dead?<br>
    It appears to have been lying in<br>
    the sun for some time.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    It's not really dead, it's<br>
    replicated. But you do understand<br>
    we... cook many of our foods...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - REV. 1/8/90 - ACT ONE 10A.</p>
  <p>8B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Ah yes... I was told to prepare<br>
    for that... I will try some of<br>
    your burned replicated bird meat.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - REV. 1/7/90 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>8B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard puts a slice on his plate.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have attempted to select a menu<br>
    that will allow you to sample a<br>
    variety of dishes, Commander.</p>
  <p> And indeed, the table is filled with a variety of<br>
    foods... and garnished with a beautiful flower<br>
    centerpiece... all the senior officers are there,<br>
    filling up their plates... Riker, Geordi, Worf,<br>
    BEVERLY, TROI, Data. Mozart is playing in the<br>
    background.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Try some caviar...</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    The odor is not palatable. What<br>
    is it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The unhatched eggs of a large<br>
    scaleless fish.</p>
  <p> Kurn reacts, are you serious... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is from the Caspian Sea on<br>
    Earth, Commander. A delicacy and<br>
    a personal favorite of mine. Our<br>
    replicators have never done it<br>
    justice. I managed to store a<br>
    few cases aboard for special<br>
    occasions...</p>
  <p> Kurn reluctantly takes some.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (dubious)<br>
    I am honored, Captain.</p>
  <p> And as he decides to finish this process of collecting<br>
    the Earth foods, he takes a good sampling of the<br>
    flowers from the centerpiece and puts them on his<br>
    plate.</p>
  <p>8C ANGLE - THE DINNER TABLE</p>
  <p> As Kurn sits opposite Troi... the others follow to the<br>
    table... Worf chooses not to be too close to Kurn.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - REV. 1/7/90 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>8C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Are you adjusting to your new<br>
    environment, Commander?</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    I find the constraints quite<br>
    difficult to conform to... I'm<br>
    sure any Klingon warrior would...</p>
  <p> Worf reacts... as Kurn continues, casually --</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    ... just a short time ago, I had<br>
    to stop myself from killing<br>
    Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> Troi laughs before realizing Kurn is not joking.<br>
    During all this, Kurn eats with much gusto and noise<br>
    and with his hands... then slowly realizes the others<br>
    are waiting for the others to sit before they begin to<br>
    eat...</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    I believe he was trying to<br>
    communicate the crew's discomfort<br>
    with my style of command...<br>
    under different circumstances,<br>
    I would take that as a challenge<br>
    to my authority.</p>
  <p> Picard now joins them at the table... and everyone<br>
    starts to eat with their knifes and fork, quite<br>
    daintily... Kurn watches tries awkwardly to imitate...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    One of the goals of the exchange<br>
    program is for all of us to learn<br>
    tolerance, Commander. As for my<br>
    crew, it may be healthy to shake up<br>
    the status quo occasionally. Feel<br>
    free to disagree, Mister Riker...</p>
  <p> Picard is deliberately displaying a casual example of<br>
    starship command by welcoming disagreement...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well, I'd say the commander<br>
    certainly has the crew on their<br>
    toes...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - REV. 1/7/90 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>8C CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    ... And then some.<br>
    (quickly realizing his<br>
    error, to Kurn)<br>
    No offense meant, sir...</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    None taken. I never kill anyone<br>
    at the supper table, Mister La<br>
    Forge.</p>
  <p> Kurn has struggled the best he can with his dinner,<br>
    cannot eat any more...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Don't you like it, Commander?</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (trying to be tactful)<br>
    Our food has much more... taste<br>
    to it. While I'm sure this is...<br>
    well prepared, it is far too bland<br>
    for the stomach of a Klingon...</p>
  <p> And the natural glance in the room has to be at Worf<br>
    who is enjoying his meal when he hears Kurn say this...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It seems to agree with Worf.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> And Worf feels extremely self-conscious, promptly<br>
    losing his appetite... and Kurn glances at him out of<br>
    the corner of his eye to put a little punctuation into<br>
    the moment...</p>

  <p>11 INT. KURN'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Kurn is standing near the table, looking over some<br>
    information on a computer terminal. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Enter.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - 1/5/90 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He turns around and the door opens, revealing Worf<br>
    standing in the corridor. Worf does not enter right<br>
    away.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    'el (Enter.)</p>
  <p> Worf steps into the room, stands stiffly at attention.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Permission to speak freely, sir?</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    For what purpose?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have questions I wish to pose.</p>
  <p> Kurn looks around his cabin with disdain and ignores<br>
    Worf's request for the moment.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Are your quarters so...<br>
    comfortable?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They serve me.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    This entire ship seems built<br>
    for... comfort, relaxation, being<br>
    at ease. It is not the ship for<br>
    a warrior... not the ship for a<br>
    Klingon.</p>
  <p> Worf says nothing, and after a beat Kurn returns to<br>
    Worf's request.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    You cannot ask these questions<br>
    within the boundaries of protocol?</p>
  <p> Worf is definitely agitated. Kurn's attitude is really<br>
    getting under his skin.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They are... of a personal nature,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> Kurn thinks for a second and then sits down.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - 1/5/90 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Permission granted. Pose your<br>
    questions.</p>
  <p> Now we can see a little more of the fires that are<br>
    burning within Worf. His entire demeanor now changes<br>
    and he cannot prevent the anger he feels from rising to<br>
    the surface.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I wish to know if I have given<br>
    you offense.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    I am not a human... if you had<br>
    given offense, you would not need<br>
    to ask.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Perhaps I have not performed my<br>
    duties to your satisfaction?</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    I find you to be a capable<br>
    Starfleet officer. A credit to<br>
    your ship.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yet you dishonor me at every<br>
    opportunity.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Have I? I was not aware that<br>
    being polite to a Starfleet<br>
    officer would bring dishonor on<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (very tight)<br>
    I am a Klingon.</p>
  <p> Kurn looks at him almost with amusement. He decides to<br>
    push a little harder. Kurn stands and casually turns<br>
    away from Worf.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Really?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Perhaps your blood has thinned<br>
    in this environment. I simply<br>
    don't want to... hurt you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - 1/5/90 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> This too much. Worf explodes with rage. He snarls a<br>
    roar of challenge and moves to Kurn, knocking over a<br>
    chair and small table in the process. Kurn whirls,<br>
    ready for anything, but brings Worf up short before<br>
    they can actually exchange blows.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    mev yap! (That is enough!)</p>
  <p> Worf stops, but it is a struggle. Kurn relaxes a bit,<br>
    but is still ready in case Worf should move on him.<br>
    Kurn looks over Worf with satisfaction... &quot;that's more<br>
    like it!&quot;</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    So... your blood is not so thin<br>
    after all.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am Klingon... if you doubt it,<br>
    a demonstration can be arranged.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    That is the response of a Klingon.<br>
    The response I would expect...<br>
    from my... older brother.</p>
  <p> Push in on Worf's reaction to this news.</p>

  <p>12 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is cruising at impulse speed.</p>
  <p>13 INT. KURN'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> A short time later. Kurn is acting less like Worf's<br>
    superior and more like his brother. But there is still<br>
    tension between them. He goes to a window, looks out.<br>
    He is thinking back over the early years of his life<br>
    and we can see the shadows pass before his eyes.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    I was barely a year old when you<br>
    went to the Khitomer Outpost.<br>
    The outpost was new... unfinished.<br>
    You... our mother and father were<br>
    not going to stay long. It was<br>
    decided that I did not need to<br>
    go. I was left with our father's<br>
    friend, Lorgh, until you returned.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You never did.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The Starfleet officer that rescued<br>
    me was told by the Klingon High<br>
    Command that I had no living<br>
    relatives.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    They assumed I was killed with<br>
    the family at Khitomer.</p>
  <p> Moving to Worf...</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Lorgh had no sons. He took me<br>
    into his family. It was not until<br>
    I had reached the Age of Ascension<br>
    that I was told the truth.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    So you asked to serve aboard the<br>
    Enterprise... to watch me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - 1/5/90 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    It was an excellent opportunity<br>
    to find out what kind of Klingon<br>
    you were... or if you were<br>
    Klingon at all.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Your deception offends me,<br>
    brother.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (pleased)<br>
    It should. But it was required.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    To satisfy your curiosity.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    No. Much more. You are the<br>
    eldest son. The challenge is<br>
    yours to make.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Challenge... ?</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    The Klingon High Council has<br>
    judged our father a traitor to<br>
    the empire.</p>
  <p> On Worf's reaction...</p>
  <p>14 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard and Worf. Picard has just learned the news,<br>
    reacts with concern.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What are the allegations, Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    My father is accused of aiding<br>
    and abetting the Romulan attack<br>
    on the Khitomer outpost.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The attack in which he himself<br>
    was killed... ?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is a lie.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - 1/5/90 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But why now... after twenty years?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I do not know, Captain. I will<br>
    hear the evidence when I arrive.<br>
    The charge has been made by Duras,<br>
    the son of my father's greatest<br>
    rival.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Our family name will be disgraced<br>
    for seven generations. It is my<br>
    responsibility to clear his name<br>
    or answer for his crimes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Answer for them?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The family of a Klingon warrior<br>
    is responsible for his actions<br>
    and he is responsible for theirs.<br>
    If I fail in my challenge, I will<br>
    be executed.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Will you grant my leave, Captain?</p>
  <p> A long beat as Picard mulls this with great concern.<br>
    Then...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If I understand correctly, a<br>
    Starfleet officer, a respected<br>
    member of my crew could stand<br>
    accused of a capital crime. Your<br>
    actions in this matter reflect<br>
    on this ship and the Federation.<br>
    (beat, personal)<br>
    Therefore, it seems only<br>
    appropriate for your captain to<br>
    be at your side as you make your<br>
    challenge, Lieutenant. I'm sure<br>
    you would do no less for me.</p>

  <p>15 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Kurn, Riker, Troi in Command. Data, and Wes at their<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander Kurn...</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are changing course. Set<br>
    coordinates for the First City<br>
    of the Klingon Imperial Empire.</p>
  <p> Kurn reacts with surprise. He had not expected the<br>
    Enterprise itself to change course. Kurn looks over<br>
    at Worf and we can see respect forming in their<br>
    relationship.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Mister Crusher...</p>

  <p> KURN<br>
    We arrive within the hour.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    The Council will receive you at<br>
    high sun in the Great Hall of--</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I know the procedures of the<br>
    challenge.</p>
  <p> Kurn nods. He's beginning to look at Worf in a<br>
    different way... as his older brother rather than as<br>
    a Klingon in a Starfleet uniform.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    You'll need a cha'DIch to defend<br>
    you. While you are accused, you<br>
    will not be allowed combat.</p>
  <p> Pause a beat as Kurn decides to take the next step.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    I would be honored if you chose<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at Kurn and can see that his brother's<br>
    opinion of him has started to change. Worf himself<br>
    is starting to think of this as their fight rather than<br>
    just his.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (formally)<br>
    I ask you to stand with me...<br>
    to be my cha'DIch.</p>

    family honor.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No. For the proceeding, you will<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    (firm)<br>
    You will not.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (understands)<br>
    Because it would mean my death<br>
    as well if you fail. A Klingon's<br>
    honor means more than his life.<br>
    Perhaps your human values cloud<br>
    your judgment. I insist...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    On this ship, you are my<br>
    commander. And I obey. In the<br>
    council chamber, you are my<br>
    cha'DIch. You do not insist.<br>
    You obey.</p>

    Yes, brother.</p>
  <p>18 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE AND KLINGON HOME WORLD<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship enters orbit. The planet has a single large<br>
    land mass, and the world is dominated by a vast ocean.<br>
    The tilt of the planet's axis has created wild seasonal<br>
    changes and the atmosphere should appear turbulent and<br>
    showing extremes of both warm and frigid weather on<br>
    the planet.</p>
  <p>19 EXT. THE FIRST CITY (MATTE SHOT)</p>
  <p> A large, sprawling city that was once an enormous<br>
    fortress. The architecture should reflect a soldier's<br>
    sensibilities for ease of defense and Spartan<br>
    decoration. The city is dominated by the Great Hall.</p>

  <p> A spare, simple room adjacent to the Great Hall, which<br>
    can be entered through an ornate door. There is a<br>
    table, chairs and a few decorations. It is basically a<br>
    waiting room for the Great Hall. Picard, Troi, Riker,<br>
    Worf, and Kurn BEAM IN.</p>
  <p> Taking in their surroundings --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (quietly to Picard)<br>
    There was a time... when just<br>
    standing here would have been a<br>
    death sentence for us.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, I am honored that you...<br>
    Commander Riker... Counselor<br>
    Troi... have chosen to accompany<br>
    me. Your presence will surely<br>
    impress the council.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're here as long as you need<br>
    us, Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Once I make the challenge, I<br>
    assume the sins of my father.<br>
    I will be in disgrace until his<br>
    innocence is proven. I would<br>
    request that you not remain for<br>
    the entire proceeding.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You will never be a disgrace to<br>
    us, Worf.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    It is a matter of personal honor<br>
    to my brother.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> Worf, Kurn, Picard, Troi, Riker, ENTER. The hall is a<br>
    parliament/supreme court/public square. One end of the<br>
    room is dominated by a raised dais with chairs for the<br>
    High Council. There is a large, open floor area and<br>
    the floor itself is emblazoned with the triangular<br>
    Klingon insignia. There should be small partitions<br>
    to suggest that the room is used for a variety of<br>
    functions. Several KLINGON SUPERNUMERARIES are<br>

  <p> As before. Worf still facing the council. K'mpec now<br>
    stands and addresses Worf.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    Worf, son of Mogh, you have<br>
    challenged the judgment of the<br>
    council. Are you prepared to<br>
    answer for this if you fail?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    With my life, K'mpec.</p>
  <p> K'mpec now turns his attention to Kurn.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    Why do you come before us,<br>

  <p> KURN<br>
    I am Kurn, son of... Lorgh. I<br>
    will stand by Worf's side. I am<br>
    cha'DIch.</p>
  <p> K'mpec nods to a GUARD, who steps forward and hands<br>
    Kurn a ceremonial scabbard and short sword which Kurn<br>
    will wear from now on. Duras stands and walks down<br>

  <p> DURAS<br>

    You claim a birthright you have<br>
    forsaken.</p>

    I am Captain Picard of the<br>

    on behalf of the Federation.</p>
  <p> DURAS<br>
    Your words have no meaning here.</p>
  <p> K'mpec raises a hand, silencing Duras, and waits for<br>
    Picard to continue.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant Worf has served under<br>
    my command with distinction. He<br>
    has earned my admiration and my<br>
    respect. It is my greatest wish<br>

    will clear his family name and<br>
    return him to duty.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    (nods with satisfaction)<br>

    is admirable... the council has<br>
    noted it.</p>

    Troi and Riker. That done, K'mpec turns his attention<br>

  <p> DURAS<br>

    For many turns, the truth about<br>
    Khitomer has lain dormant...<br>
    unknown. Now the truth is<br>

    I would speak with you alone.</p>
  <p> A glance passes between Worf and Kurn, but one does<br>

    that is my enemy.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Captain, I must choose a new<br>
    cha'DIch. I would like your<br>
    permission to ask a member of the<br>
    crew.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course, Lieutenant. Ask<br>
    whomever you wish.</p>
  <p> Worf hesitates, not sure what Picard's reaction will<br>
    be. Picard waits for him to go on.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - REV. 1/8/90 - ACT FOUR 39A.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, I would ask that you stand<br>
    with me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - REV. 1/8/90 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p>45 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard reacts, very surprised.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    You may refuse... with no<br>
    dishonor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I appreciate the gesture,<br>
    Lieutenant. But I know there are<br>
    stronger, younger men from which<br>
    to choose...</p>
  <p> This is a difficult moment for Worf. He must actually<br>
    voice some of his inner feelings and motivations, and<br>
    it doesn't come easily.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A Klingon warrior knows that brute<br>
    strength is not the most important<br>
    asset in a fight. I have served<br>
    under you in many conflicts...<br>
    and know you to be a shrewd and<br>
    forceful opponent. I can think<br>
    of no one I would rather have at<br>
    my side.</p>
  <p> Picard is moved by this expression of admiration by<br>
    his officer. There is a brief pause. Picard walks<br>
    over to Worf, looks him in the eye.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> Duras reacts to them and moves away from the<br>
    assassins. Worf moves forward to address the council<br>
    and Duras.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Hall)<br>
    My challenge will proceed. No<br>
    threat, no treachery will stop<br>
    it.<br>

  <p> Picard moves quickly in front of Worf in a defensive<br>
    move and Duras is brought up short by this unexpected<br>
    action. Duras is dumbfounded, and unsure just what the<br>
    hell Picard thinks he's doing.</p>
  <p> DURAS<br>
    Keep your place, Picard!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is my place.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He is now my cha'DIch.</p>
  <p> The crowd REACTS to this news. Duras is outraged.</p>

    No! This cannot be allowed.<br>

    This is not your world, human.<br>

  <p> Picard confronts Duras directly. He's not taking any<br>
    crap from this guy. Picard's voice is low and deadly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You may test that assumption...<br>
    at your convenience.</p>
  <p> Duras's eyes narrow and they stand toe to toe for a<br>
    few seconds before K'mpec intervenes.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    The cha'DIch is accepted.</p>
  <p> DURAS<br>

    him on it.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    You challenge my authority?</p>
  <p> Duras looks chastened at K'mpec, backs down. Picard<br>
    gives Worf a look: &quot;How was that?&quot; Worf nods his head<br>
    in approval. K'mpec motions to the guard, who then<br>
    brings over a ceremonial scabbard and sword identical<br>

    his log that Mogh had been acting<br>
    suspiciously... that he was often<br>
    away from his post for long<br>
    periods of time. The commander<br>
    found that Mogh was sending coded<br>
    neutrino pulses to a sector within<br>
    Romulan territory. A formal charge<br>

  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>56 EXT OLD CITY STREET</p>
  <p> A narrow, gloomy street in the oldest section of the<br>
    capital city. A hooded figure in a cape moves down<br>
    the street. The figure stops in front of a simple<br>
    door, above which is a unique symbol (possibly a bigger<br>
    representation of the emblem worn on Worf's sash?).</p>
  <p>56A ON PICARD</p>
  <p> as he moves the hood enough so we can see him. He<br>
    looks around and then sounds the door CHIME. After a<br>
    few seconds, the door slides aside and Picard goes in.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>57 INT. KLINGON HOME</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS from the street. The home is small, yet<br>
    comfortable. The furnishings should be in contrast<br>
    to the martial decor of the rest of the planet... this<br>
    is the home of an old woman with no need to proclaim<br>
    power or strength. Picard looks around for a few<br>
    seconds, lets his eyes adjust to the dimmer light.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Kahlest?</p>
  <p> KAHLEST moves in the shadows. She does not step into<br>
    the light yet, but answers from the safety of the<br>

    What do you want?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Your help.</p>
  <p> KAHLEST<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Kahlest moves out of the shadows and we can see that<br>
    she is quite old by Klingon standards. She barely<br>
    looks at Picard as they talk.</p>

    Were you with Worf's father just<br>
    before the attack on Khitomer?</p>
  <p> The the mention of Khitomer, Kahlest moves away from<br>
    Picard and her face becomes even more tired and<br>

  <p> KAHLEST<br>
    I was not. I was with Worf only.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (sighs, concluding)<br>
    Then, there is no way to prove<br>
    Mogh's innocence, and Worf will<br>
    die as the son of a traitor.</p>
  <p> KAHLEST<br>
    You must leave, cha'DIch. I am<br>
    dead.</p>
  <p> Picard cannot think of anything else, EXITS.</p>
  <p>58 EXT. OLD CITY STREET</p>
  <p> Picard has left the house and is heading back up the<br>
    street when the two assassins suddenly burst out of<br>
    a recess in the wall and attack Picard. They are<br>
    wielding the same ornate weapons seen earlier.</p>
  <p> Picard is not the easy mark they had taken him for,<br>
    however. The captain is able to move out of the way<br>
    before they can land a blow on him. He brings Assassin<br>
    #1 to the ground by whipping off his cape and throwing<br>
    it with a flourish in Assassin #1's face.</p>
  <p> Assassin #2 lunges forward with his weapon, but Picard<br>
    has now pulled his own ceremonial sword and parries the<br>
    thrust. Assassin #2 makes a hard thrust. Picard grabs<br>
    the Klingon's hand and falls backward, yanking the<br>
    Klingon off balance and bringing them both down.<br>
    Picard holds his own sword steady and the Klingon falls<br>
    directly on the point as he falls on top of Picard.</p>

  <p> Assassin #1 is back on his feet and prepares to kill<br>
    Picard as he's trapped under the fallen Klingon...<br>

  <p> She starts to return inside. Picard gets an idea.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Kahlest, would they know who you<br>
    are? Would they recognize you?</p>
  <p> She pauses.</p>
  <p> KAHLEST<br>
    K'mpec would remember Kahlest.<br>
    I caught his eye back then. I<br>
    had many suitors once. He wanted<br>
    seloh (sex) with me. He was too<br>

  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    It is good to see you again.</p>
  <p> KAHLEST<br>
    You are still fat, K'mpec.</p>
  <p> And with a brief twinkle in her for Picard, she EXITS.<br>
    K'mpec regards Worf with regret. Shakes his head.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    I asked you to leave, to let this<br>
    judgment go unanswered... but<br>
    you did not hear my words, and<br>
    now it has come to this.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Why did you judge my father guilty<br>
    when you knew he was not?</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    (apologetic)<br>
    Someone had to be blamed. The<br>
    warriors who captured the Romulan<br>
    ship had learned of the treachery.<br>
    But only the council knew whose<br>
    security code had been<br>
    transmitted. Ja'rod, father of<br>
    Duras.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (indicates Duras)<br>
    This Ha'DIbaH (animal) should have<br>
    been fed to the dogs!</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    His family is powerful. If the<br>
    truth were known, it would shatter<br>
    the council... almost certainly<br>
    plunge us into civil war.<br>
    (looks at Worf)<br>
    You were in Starfleet... we did<br>
    not expect you to challenge the<br>
    judgment. Nor did we know that<br>
    there was another son of Mogh.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - REV. 1/15/90 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Worf's challenge is successful.<br>
    His family honor must be restored,<br>
    K'mpec.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    (regret)<br>
    You don't understand. His<br>
    challenge was defeated before he<br>
    ever made it. You will not be<br>
    allowed to present this evidence.<br>
    The judgment will stand and you<br>
    will be condemned... as will your<br>
    brother.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You admit the truth and still<br>
    expect him to accept punishment.<br>
    What does this say of an empire<br>
    that holds honor so dear?</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    The empire will not be destroyed<br>
    for one family's honor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is unacceptable, K'mpec.</p>
  <p> DURAS<br>
    You have no say in this, cha'DIch!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I speak now as the captain of<br>
    the USS Enterprise and<br>
    Lieutenant Worf's commanding<br>
    officer. You will not execute<br>
    a member of my crew, sir. Nor<br>
    will I turn his brother over to<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    You risk much. This is not the<br>
    Federation, Picard. If you defy<br>
    the orders of the High Council<br>
    in an affair of the empire, the<br>
    alliance with the Federation<br>
    could fall to dust.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - REV. 1/8/90 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED: (6)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The alliance with the Federation<br>
    is not based on lies! Protect<br>
    your secrets if you must, but do<br>
    not sacrifice these men.</p>
  <p> DURAS<br>
    A true Klingon will not run from<br>
    his judgment, Captain. No matter<br>
    what you would have them do.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    What will you do with Kurn? Make<br>
    him a Starfleet officer? He is<br>
    a Klingon. When his tour aboard<br>
    your ship is complete he will have<br>
    no place to go. He would rather<br>
    die.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will die for the empire.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant...</p>
  <p> Worf gives him a hard look --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The cha'DIch will be silent.</p>
  <p> Picard blinks, shuts up.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Allow my brother to return to his<br>
    life. Only you need know his<br>
    true bloodline.</p>
  <p> DURAS<br>
    Not acceptable. His honor would<br>
    demand revenge. He is too<br>
    dangerous.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    If you allow him to live, I will<br>
    give you something that will<br>
    serve your purpose far more than<br>
    my death. I will accept...<br>
    discommendation.</p>
  <p> K'mpec and Duras exchange a glance -- this is pretty<br>
    good for them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - REV. 1/8/90 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED: (7)</p>
  <p> DURAS<br>
    You would do this in open council?</p>
  <p> Worf acknowledges.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    It would be the same as admitting<br>
    your father's guilt, Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    So be it.</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    (with respect)<br>
    Your heart is Klingon. It will<br>
    be done.<br>
    (to others)<br>
    What has been said here will never<br>
    be spoken of again.</p>
  <p> Worf steps to Duras... one last thing to do.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You... are the son of a traitor.</p>
  <p> And he slaps Duras just as hard as Duras hit him<br>
    earlier. Duras burns with the shame of it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am ready.</p>
  <p>64 INT. GREAT HALL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard is waiting off to one side for something. The<br>
    transporter EFFECT begins and Kurn beams in along with<br>
    a MEDICAL SUPERNUMERARY who is helping him. Kurn is<br>
    recovering from his injuries, but is still a little<br>
    unsteady on his feet.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (to supernumerary)<br>
    Enough! I will stand alone in<br>
    the hall.</p>
  <p> Picard nods to the ensign and Kurn steps forward on his<br>
    own. He and Picard move slowly toward the other end<br>
    of the hall.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - REV. 1/8/90 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>64 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Why is he doing this? I was ready<br>
    to die.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Worf wants you to live... the name<br>
    of your father must someday be<br>
    cleared. He needs you alive...<br>
    with your honor intact.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    But to do this...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There will be another day,<br>
    Commander. Do not forget what<br>
    he does here today... do not let<br>
    your children forget.</p>
  <p> Kurn nods in agreement and they go through the crowd.</p>
  <p>64A NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> The council in session. Worf facing them as Picard and<br>
    Kurn move to stand on either side of him. K'mpec faces<br>
    Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    tlhIH ghIj jIHyoj. (I fear your<br>
    judgment)</p>
  <p> K'MPEC<br>
    biHnuch (Coward)</p>
  <p> The crowd REACTS with disgust. The council rises as<br>
    one and turn their backs on Worf. The assembled crowd<br>
    does the same. Worf turns to Kurn.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You must also...</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (beat, then sotto voce)<br>
    May you stand here again someday<br>
    and roar over the fallen bodies<br>
    of your enemies.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We will stand together...<br>
    (sotto)<br>
    ...brother.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; - REV. 1/9/90 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>64A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> They share a moment of silent promise, then Kurn<br>
    reluctantly turns his back on his brother. Picard<br>
    moves to Worf and they walk side by side, heads held<br>
    high through the crowd and EXIT. The double doors<br>
    close behind with a LOUD CLANG as we...</p>
