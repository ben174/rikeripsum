  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. REHEARSAL HALL</p>
  <p> (Note: this is a re-dress of the Klingon outpost set<br>
    from &quot;Firstborn&quot;.) The room is dark, the walls obscured<br>
    by a light fog. DATA is standing in the dim light of<br>
    a single burning TORCH. He is wearing loose-fitting,<br>
    ritual ROBES, and he holds a carved wooden STAFF in one<br>
    hand and a large, ancient-looking BOOK in the other.<br>
    The SOUND of the nearby ocean can be heard. Data's<br>
    voice is solemn, incantatory.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    &quot;I have bedimm'd the noontide sun,<br>
    call'd forth the mutinous winds,<br>
    and 'twixt the green sea and the<br>
    azur'd vault set roaring war: to<br>
    the dread rattling thunder have I<br>
    given fire, and rifted Jove's<br>
    stout oak with his own bolt; the<br>
    strong-bas'd promontory have I<br>
    made shake and by the spurs<br>
    pluck'd up the pine and cedar;<br>
    graves at my command have wak'd<br>
    their sleepers, op'd, and let 'em<br>
    forth by my so potent art.&quot;</p>
  <p> Data dramatically holds up the book.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    &quot;But this rough magic I here<br>
    abjure; and, when I have requir'd<br>
    some Heavenly music -- which even<br>
    now I do -- to work mine end upon<br>
    their senses, that this airy charm<br>
    is for, I'll break my staff, bury<br>
    it certain fadoms in the earth,<br>
    and deeper than did ever plummet<br>
    sound -- I'll drown my book.&quot;</p>
  <p> He stops suddenly, his face now completely &quot;Data.&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Captain, your attention is...<br>
    wandering.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/24/94 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>2 INCLUDE PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> standing nearby in the half-light.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can barely see.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/17/94 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, I am supposed to be<br>
    attempting a Neo-Platonic magical<br>
    rite -- the darkness is<br>
    appropriate to such a ritual.</p>
  <p> (CONTINUED)<br>
    PICARD<br>
    This is a play, Data. The<br>
    audience has to see you.</p>
  <p> Data considers for a beat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps I have been too... literal<br>
    with respect to my set design.<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Computer. Modify Holodeck program<br>
    Data seven-three, Shakespeare's<br>
    The Tempest, Act Five, scene one.<br>
    Increase torchlight by twenty-percent.</p>
  <p> The torch flares up.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Much better.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Would you like to try it again?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir... but I am not certain<br>
    I fully understand the character<br>
    of Prospero. I would appreciate<br>
    any insights you may have which<br>
    would improve my performance.</p>
  <p> Picard nods, considering for a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well... Shakespeare witnessed the<br>
    end of the Renaissance and the<br>
    birth of the modern era. Prospero<br>
    found himself in a world which no<br>
    longer had any use for his<br>
    powers...</p>
  <p> Picard indicates the scene.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Here he is about to perform one<br>
    final creative act before giving<br>
    up his art forever.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/17/94 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is certainly a tragic aspect<br>
    to the character.</p>
  <p> Picard nods. In the far distance, we just begin to<br>
    hear an approaching SOUND.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, but he had a certain...<br>
    expectancy as well. A hopefulness<br>
    about the future...</p>
  <p> The sound is now distinct enough so that both Picard<br>
    and Data begin to notice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Shakespeare enjoyed mixing<br>
    opposites...</p>
  <p> Data is now staring into the distance in the direction<br>
    the sound appears to be coming from, puzzled. Picard<br>
    does the same, his voice trailing off...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Past and future... Despair and<br>
    hope...</p>
  <p> Now a growing POINT OF LIGHT can be seen, getting<br>
    closer as the sound starts to resemble a distant,<br>
    increasing roar.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Data, is this part of your<br>
    program?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, Sir.</p>
  <p> The light and sound are much louder.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then what is it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It appears to be a steam<br>
    locomotive.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A train?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/17/94 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    If I am not mistaken.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Computer, end program.</p>
  <p> The glaring beam hits them like a horizontal spotlight.<br>
    The roar grows. Picard reacts.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing, louder)<br>
    Computer, end program...</p>
  <p> Nothing. This is all too real. Picard and Data<br>
    simultaneously DIVE CLEAR of the tracks.</p>
  <p>3 PICARD AND DATA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> on the ground. They look up at the train as it<br>
    thunders by, catching glimpses of the car windows, the<br>
    cranking, screeching wheels. The roar and clatter<br>
    overwhelm any other sounds... And then suddenly it's<br>
    past them... and it's gone. The room is back to way it<br>
    was.</p>
  <p> Picard has a slight SCRAPE on his forehead from the<br>
    fall. OFF their puzzled expressions...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/17/94 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>4 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> The Holodeck DOORS OPEN and Picard and Data step out<br>
    (NOTE: Data is still wearing the Prospero costume).<br>
    Data notices the cut on Picard's forehead.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    Captain, you are injured...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's just a scrape... I'll have it<br>
    seen to...</p>
  <p> Data begins to work the Holodeck panel.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The train we encountered is from<br>
    one of Doctor Crusher's Holodeck<br>
    programs. It is a re-creation of<br>
    the Orient Express, a train which<br>
    ran from Paris to Istanbul from<br>
    the late nineteenth century until --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, yes, I know about the Orient<br>
    Express... but what was it doing<br>
    on Prospero's Island?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There appears to have been a<br>
    malfunction in the Holodeck's<br>
    database retrieval system. The<br>
    two programs were somehow<br>
    temporarily linked together.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Could this malfunction affect the<br>
    other Holodecks as well?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is a possibility. I would have<br>
    to run a diagnostic to be certain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right, get to it. And shut<br>
    down all of the Holodecks until<br>
    you're finished, just to be on the<br>
    safe side.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/17/94 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard heads down the corridor, leaving Data as he<br>
    continues to work the panel.</p>
  <p>5 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Picard is sitting on a biobed as BEVERLY treats his<br>
    forehead with a MEDICAL INSTRUMENT, healing the scrape<br>
    as they speak.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I never realized you were<br>
    interested in trains. Did you<br>
    know that at its peak, the Orient<br>
    Express carried over ten thousand<br>
    passengers a year?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's not really the train itself<br>
    I'm interested in...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then what?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The experience.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The Orient Express was... mystery<br>
    and romance. It was an elegant<br>
    way to see exotic places and meet<br>
    fascinating people...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Did you know that on one trip,<br>
    both Sigmund Freud and Gertrude<br>
    Stein just happened to be on the<br>
    same car? They ended up having<br>
    dinner together every night.</p>
  <p> Picard's intrigued by the notion.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I wonder what they talked<br>
    about... ?</p>
  <p> Beverly smiles.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Why don't you take a trip<br>
    yourself... and find out?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/18/94 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Riker to Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Picard here.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    All sections are ready to begin<br>
    the survey, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Very good. I'm on my way.</p>
  <p> Picard jumps down from the biobed and heads for the<br>
    door.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Think about that trip, Jean-Luc...<br>
    You never know who you'll meet on<br>
    the Orient Express...</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 47869.2.<br>
    After weathering an unexpected<br>
    magnascopic storm in the Mekorda<br>
    Sector, we are continuing our<br>
    search for new Federation colony<br>
    sites.</p>
  <p>7 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard and RIKER are at their command chairs, Data at<br>
    Ops. N.D.s are at various stations. Riker hands<br>
    Picard a PADD.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't see any possibility of<br>
    developing sites in this region.<br>
    Most of the stars are mainsequence<br>
    binaries with no M-class<br>
    planets.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - 02/17/94 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (reads PADD)<br>
    All right then, let's move on to<br>
    the next survey region... Have<br>
    stellar cartography begin a--</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the SHIP LURCHES FORWARD.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, report.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    The ship has gone into warp, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Who gave the command?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Apparently no one. Helm and<br>
    navigation controls are not<br>
    functioning.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Our speed is now warp seven-point-three<br>
    and holding.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Picard to Engineering. Mister La<br>
    Forge, what's going on down there?</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>8 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> GEORDI is frantically moving between consoles.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to com)<br>
    I don't understand it, sir. The<br>
    impulse systems suddenly cut out<br>
    and the warp drive kicked in.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Geordi, can you take the engines<br>
    off-line?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm working on it...</p>
  <p> Geordi moves off to work another console.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/17/94 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, what's our heading?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Bearing one-eight-seven mark four.<br>
    I am unable to determine our<br>
    destination -- but we are heading<br>
    away from the Mekorda sector.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker exchange a puzzled look.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (breaking in)<br>
    Captain, the computer's locked-out<br>
    all the propulsion controls... I<br>
    can't access any of the<br>
    overrides...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If you want us to stop, we'll have<br>
    to do an emergency core shutdown...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    That'll leave us without warp<br>
    power for more than a week...</p>
  <p> But Picard does not like having the ship out of his<br>
    control.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Begin the procedure, Mister La<br>
    Forge...</p>
  <p> A tense beat... and then there is a VIOLENT JOLT as the<br>
    ship suddenly drops out of warp.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    We are no longer at warp...<br>
    Impulse power has resumed... all<br>
    systems show normal.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where are we?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    We are approximately thirty-billion<br>
    kilometers from our<br>
    original position.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/18/94 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Good work, Geordi.</p>
  <p> Geordi is checking the readout of a console, shaking<br>
    his head.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It wasn't me that took us out of<br>
    warp, sir. I didn't have time to<br>
    complete the shut-down<br>
    procedure...</p>
  <p> A puzzling beat. Picard doesn't like this one bit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Well, I want an explanation.<br>
    Picard out.</p>
  <p> OFF Picard and Riker's expressions.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>9 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> moving at impulse.</p>
  <p>10 INT. BRIDGE - AFT SCIENCE</p>
  <p> Picard walks up to the station where Data and Geordi<br>
    are carefully studying an OKUDAGRAM on the monitor.<br>
    The graphic shows the ship surrounded by a &quot;sea&quot; of<br>
    small, intense regions of energy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Have you found anything, yet?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Only that we've got more than one<br>
    mystery here, sir...</p>
  <p> Picard reacts.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/18/94 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We still don't know why the ship<br>
    jumped into warp... but it looks<br>
    like we're lucky it did.</p>
  <p> Picard gives him a questioning look.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There was a theta flux distortion<br>
    building up around the ship.</p>
  <p> Geordi indicates the monitor graphic which Picard<br>
    studies briefly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    Why didn't the sensors alert us?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Our sensors were never designed to<br>
    detect theta flux distortions.<br>
    And yet -- there is a record of<br>
    the distortion in the sensor log.<br>
    That's the other mystery.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    One fact is clear, however. The<br>
    distortion was gaining in<br>
    strength. If we had remained at<br>
    our original position one-point<br>
    seven seconds longer, the<br>
    distortion would have ruptured our<br>
    warp core.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If the Enterprise hadn't jumped<br>
    into warp when it did... we<br>
    would've been blown to pieces.</p>
  <p> OFF Picard's reaction.</p>

    of the tube.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I just don't get it, Data. What<br>
    could have caused the engines to<br>
    jump into warp drive on their own?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps the engines were activated<br>
    by a random power fluctuation.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (skeptical)<br>
    Which occurred just in time to<br>
    save the ship?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is improbable... but it is<br>
    possible.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, I don't think I'm ready to<br>
    start believing in luck.</p>
  <p> They have arrived near a MEESPANEL in the side of the<br>
    tube, and Geordi begins to remove it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is another possibility. The<br>
    sensors apparently detected a<br>
    dangerous anomaly that threatened<br>
    the Enterprise. It is possible<br>
    that they triggered a safety<br>
    response which caused the ship to<br>
    avoid destruction.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But there's no direct link between<br>
    the sensors and the warp<br>
    engines...</p>
  <p> As he peers into the junction, he pulls back in<br>
    surprise.</p>

  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What is this... ?</p>
  <p> Inside the panel he sees...</p>
  <p>13 A COMPLEX NODE OF INTERCONNECTIONS</p>
  <p> completely different in color and appearance from the<br>
    circuitry around it.</p>
  <p>14 RESUME SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Geordi and Data begin scanning the mysterious node.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    It's some kind of new circuit<br>
    node... and it's connected to at<br>
    least half a dozen points in the<br>
    sensor array...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    It appears to be connected to<br>
    several other systems as well...<br>
    including the warp control<br>
    circuits.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I guess there is a link between<br>
    the sensors and the engines after<br>
    all..</p>
  <p> Geordi takes out his tech instrument and attempts to<br>
    probe the strange node... suddenly, a FORCE FIELD<br>
    flashes briefly, forcing him back.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/18/94 - ACT TWO 14.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He pulls back, startled.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    A force field... where did that<br>
    come from?</p>
  <p> Data scans.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am not certain -- possibly from<br>
    the node itself.</p>
  <p> Geordi reaches toward the node once more, and again,<br>
    the force field FRITZES.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well... wherever it came from...<br>
    it sure doesn't want us messing<br>
    with that node.</p>
  <p> Data regards the strange node, puzzling over the odd<br>
    events, his positronic matrix working to solve the<br>
    mystery.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It appears to be protecting<br>
    itself.</p>
  <p> OFF Geordi's look...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>15 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi are briefing Riker at the pool table.<br>
    A monitor displays a GRAPHIC of the Enterprise,<br>
    highlighting the locations of several connection nodes<br>
    scattered throughout the ship. The connection nodes<br>
    are all linked together, and the image suggests the<br>
    crude beginnings of spider's web.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re: graphic)<br>
    We found these &quot;nodes&quot; in several<br>
    systems around the ship. At some<br>
    level, they were all connected to<br>
    each other.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There were nodes linking the<br>
    sensors to our warp control and<br>
    defensive systems. We believe<br>
    this is why the ship jumped to<br>
    warp.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/17/94 - ACT TWO 15.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    When the sensors detected danger,<br>
    the defensive systems reacted to<br>
    the threat -- and activated the<br>
    warp engines to protect us.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where did these nodes come from?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is possible that the<br>
    magnascopic storm we recently<br>
    experienced had an unexpected<br>
    effect on the ship's systems.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Wherever they came from, they seem<br>
    to be multiplying.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    As they increase, it will become<br>
    progressively more difficult to<br>
    control the ship.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What do you propose we do?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, it's not going to be easy to<br>
    get rid of them.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    When we attempted to examine the<br>
    circuitry of one of the nodes, it<br>
    generated a force-field to keep us<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Whatever's going on here -- our<br>
    first priority is to get back<br>
    control of the ship.</p>

  <p> Data indicates a point on the graphic.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    All of the nodes intersect in<br>
    Holodeck three. It appears to be<br>
    a... focal point of some kind.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We might be able to find a way to<br>
    use the Holodeck circuits to<br>
    disable the nodes...</p>

    tapping commands into the control panel.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    Commander, the Holodeck appears to<br>
    be in operation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I thought you shut down the entire<br>
    system.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I did. However, it has reactivated<br>
    itself... and it will<br>
    not disengage.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Which program is running?</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    (off panel)<br>
    Several different programs appear<br>
    to be running simultaneously.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well... this should be<br>
    interesting...</p>
  <p> The three exchange a look and then step through the<br>
    door into...</p>
  <p>17 INT. HOLODECK/TRAIN - SALON CAR</p>
  <p> It's a classic Victorian salon car, decorated in the<br>
    opulent, grand style of the time. There's a door at<br>
    each end and the WINDOWS are covered by closed DRAPES;<br>
    a SIGNAL CABLE runs along one of the walls, used by<br>
    passengers to signal the engineer. The HUMMING of the<br>
    rails and the CLACKETY-CLACK of the tracks can be heard<br>
    as the train speeds along.</p>
  <p> Data immediately begins scanning the area as Riker and<br>
    Worf try to get their bearings, carefully observing the<br>
    bizarre scene:</p>
  <p> Two 1920's Zelda Fitzgerald-style FLAPPERS sit at an<br>
    elegant table with a briefcase-wielding MAN IN A GREY<br>
    FLANNEL SUIT. They are engrossed in piecing together<br>
    a large JIGSAW PUZZLE of a strange, multi-colored THREE-DIMENSIONAL<br>
    MOLECULE...</p>
  <p> A Medieval KNIGHT in shining armor is in another corner<br>
    of the car. He is carefully cutting a folded newspaper<br>
    with a large pair of SCISSORS. Beside him is a HAYSEED<br>
    wearing a floppy straw hat and overalls, a corncob pipe<br>
    stuck in his mouth -- a real hick. The Hayseed<br>
    watches, fascinated, as the Knight continues to cut...</p>
  <p> A dangerous-looking GUNSLINGER straight out of the old<br>
    West stalks silently up and down the aisle. He moves<br>
    with what might be murderous intent to the Flapper and<br>
    the Flannel Man... he reaches for his belt... and pulls<br>
    out a PUZZLE PIECE. He places it just where it belongs<br>
    into the puzzle, then takes a seat to help them<br>
    continue...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (a bit overwhelmed)<br>
    You weren't kidding, Data...</p>

  <p> DATA<br>

    No, sir. I estimate that this...<br>
    scene consists of portions of at<br>
    least seven distinct Holodeck<br>
    programs...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    See if you can access the circuits<br>
    that have been affected by the<br>
    nodes.</p>
  <p> Data and Worf acknowledge and move off, scanning the<br>
    cabin.</p>
  <p> At that moment, the front door OPENS, and the CONDUCTOR<br>
    ENTERS the car. He is dressed like a typical American<br>
    trainman circa 1920 and has the typical cheery-but-take-no-guff<br>
    attitude of his kind.</p>
  <p> CONDUCTOR<br>
    Tickets please... please have your<br>
    tickets ready...</p>
  <p> The Hayseed fishes through his pockets for a TICKET and<br>
    hands it to the Conductor.</p>
  <p> HAYSEED<br>

    You know, I've never even been<br>
    away from home... and now I'm<br>
    goin' all the way to Vertiform<br>
    City!</p>
  <p> As the Conductor punches the tickets, the Knight stops<br>
    cutting his newspaper and opens it out -- he has<br>
    fashioned it into a STRING OF PAPER DOLLS.</p>

  <p> He shows it expectantly to the Conductor.</p>
  <p> CONDUCTOR<br>
    Very nice, sir. Enjoy your trip.</p>
  <p> The Conductor hands the tickets back to the Hayseed and<br>
    continues down the aisle, moving past Riker, Data, and<br>
    Worf as if they didn't exist.</p>

  <p> Riker turns to see Data and Worf standing near a<br>
    section of the car's wall. They are scanning it<br>
    carefully with their tricorders. Riker joins them.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We have located a large<br>
    concentration of nodes behind this<br>
    wall... They appear to be<br>
    connected directly to the<br>
    Holodeck's main power coupling.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All right... go ahead and<br>
    depolarize the entire power grid.</p>

  <p> CONDUCTOR (O.S.)<br>
    Get away from there...</p>
  <p> The Conductor is standing right behind them. His voice<br>
    is cold and suspicious, and all traces of his earlier,<br>
    cheerful manner are gone. Everyone in the car is now<br>
    staring at the group, seeing them for the first time.<br>
    It's a spooky, unsettling moment.</p>
  <p> CONDUCTOR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Would you gentlemen care to show<br>
    me your tickets?</p>
  <p> He moves a little closer, menacingly... This is getting<br>
    really creepy. Riker tries to fake his way out.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We... left them in our<br>

    I don't think you folks belong on<br>
    this train...</p>
  <p> He starts to move in... and suddenly, the front door of<br>
    the car BURSTS OPEN, and the ENGINEER rushes in. He is<br>
    an excitable, bespectacled man in a traditional train<br>
    engineer's uniform. He moves straight for the<br>
    Conductor.</p>

    Conductor tugs the cable several times, causing several<br>
    CHIMES to sound. Suddenly, the wheels SCREECH and the<br>
    train LURCHES, tossing everybody to one side. With a<br>
    LOUD BLAST from the train's WHISTLE, the train<br>
    straightens itself again and continues forward even<br>
    faster than before...</p>

  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>25 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Riker, Data and Geordi are gathered around the pool<br>
    table. A monitor GRAPHIC displays the connection nodes<br>
    throughout the ship; compared to the previous graphic,<br>
    the number of nodes has increased dramatically, and the<br>
    &quot;spider's web&quot; of connections has become far more<br>
    complex.</p>
  <p> Data is studying it with keen interest.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The number of systems now affected<br>

    Sensors, engines, replicators,<br>

    together now, almost independently<br>
    of the main computer. And the<br>
    nodes link all of them through the<br>
    Holodeck.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But why the Holodeck? That<br>
    doesn't make any sense.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander, I think what happens on<br>
    the Holodeck has a direct effect<br>
    on the ship. When we attempted to<br>
    destroy the nodes -- the<br>
    characters on the train responded<br>
    immediately to stop us.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/17/94 - ACT TWO 25.</p>

  <p> Riker considers the chain of events.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And when the Engineer tried to<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    The Conductor then signalled for<br>
    the train to change directions...<br>
    and at approximately the same time --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    new direction, too.</p>
  <p> The group considers this reasoning carefully.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you saying... that the ship is<br>
    being controlled by the Holodeck?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Not precisely.</p>
  <p> Data gestures again to the graphic.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi, does the configuration of<br>
    the connection nodes look familiar<br>
    to you?</p>
  <p> Geordi peers at the graphic, studying it carefully.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (realizing)<br>
    Yeah... it's... a little like the<br>
    structure of your positronic<br>
    brain.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct. It appears that<br>
    the nodes are in the process of<br>
    creating a rudimentary neural net.</p>
  <p> Riker and Geordi eye him in astonishment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data -- what are you suggesting?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Unlikely as it may sound... I<br>
    believe that the Enterprise may be<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Complex systems can sometimes<br>
    behave in ways that are entirely<br>

  <p> A beat as he looks around at the group.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But that description does not<br>
    explain human consciousness -- a<br>
    capacity that far exceeds simple<br>
    neural functions.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Consciousness is an emergent<br>
    property.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    In other words, something that's<br>
    more than the sum of its parts...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Exactly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How does that explain what's<br>
    happening to the Enterprise?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Enterprise contains a vast<br>
    database of information which is<br>
    managed by a sophisticated<br>
    computer. This complex system<br>
    gives the ship many of the<br>
    characteristics of a biological<br>
    organism.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's true... it &quot;sees&quot; with its<br>
    sensors... &quot;talks&quot; with its<br>
    communications systems...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    In a sense, it even &quot;reproduces&quot;<br>
    with the replicators...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    And you think the ship has somehow<br>
    gone beyond those functions... has<br>
    developed a new capacity...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. I believe a self-determining<br>
    intelligence is<br>
    emerging.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/22/94 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> There's a beat as they consider the implications --<br>
    it's a difficult concept to accept.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    If that is so... what does the<br>
    ship want? Where is it taking us?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe the key to understanding<br>
    the ship's behavior lies in the<br>
    Holodeck.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    All of the connection nodes<br>
    intersect at that location. It is<br>
    clearly some kind of processing<br>
    center.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Processing center... ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. A focal point... where<br>
    all the ideas and instincts of<br>
    this emerging intelligence are<br>
    first expressed in some form.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Almost like an &quot;imagination... &quot;</p>
  <p> A beat as Troi considers this.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Sir, I'd like to go to the<br>
    Holodeck. I could interact with<br>
    the characters... maybe find some<br>
    clues that would help us<br>
    understand what's happening.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. Mister Data, Mister<br>
    Worf, you'll go along. See if<br>
    there's any way to re-establish<br>
    control of the ship without<br>
    destroying the nodes.<br>

  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If this ship truly is an emerging<br>
    intelligence, then it's our<br>
    responsibility to treat it with<br>
    the same respect we would give any<br>
    other being.</p>
  <p> Data nods and the meeting breaks up.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>28 INT. HOLODECK/TRAIN - SALON CAR</p>
  <p> Troi, Data, and Worf ENTER from the rear door. Data is<br>
    carrying a small SCANNING DEVICE. They hear a loud<br>
    CLANG... CLANG... CLANG... and turn toward it...</p>
  <p>29 THE SCENE</p>
  <p> One of the Flappers is attempting to give the Knight a<br>
    drink from a beautiful CHALICE... but she keeps banging<br>
    it against his visor. CLANG... CLANG... CLANG.</p>
  <p> Elsewhere, the Man in the Grey Flannel Suit sits in a<br>
    chair, calmly reading a newspaper. Beside him, the<br>
    Gunslinger is bound head-to-toe in a heavy rope, a gag<br>
    stuffed in his mouth.</p>
  <p> The Hayseed and one of the Flappers are sitting at the<br>
    elegant table, still working on the jigsaw puzzle.</p>
  <p> The Conductor is nowhere to be seen.</p>
  <p> Troi reacts to the bizarre scene.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Welcome aboard, Counselor...</p>
  <p> Data activates his device.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If you will distract these people,<br>
    I will attempt to depolarize the<br>
    power grid.</p>
  <p> Data moves down the aisle.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/18/94 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>30 TROI AND WORF</p>
  <p> move to the elegant table where The Hayseed looks up at<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Have you finished the puzzle yet?</p>
  <p> HAYSEED<br>
    Not yet... but we're gettin'<br>
    close.</p>
  <p> Worf and Troi look curiously at the puzzle.</p>
  <p>31 INCLUDE THE PUZZLE</p>
  <p> The nearly complete puzzle is a picture of a strange,<br>
    multi-colored THREE-DIMENSIONAL molecule -- it suggests<br>
    a cross between a strand of DNA and an electronic<br>
    circuit.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Do you recognize it?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to the puzzlers)<br>
    I'd like to help.</p>
  <p> Worf takes a seat... Troi moves off. Worf takes a<br>
    puzzle piece and after a brief search, places it<br>
    correctly in the puzzle.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Tell me... exactly what are you<br>
    making?</p>
  <p> HAYSEED<br>
    What do you think we're makin'? A<br>
    puzzle!</p>
  <p> Worf tries again.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No, I mean the picture. What is<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/18/94 - ACT THREE 31.</p>

    I don't know.</p>
  <p>32 OMITTED</p>
  <p>33 THE HITMAN</p>
  <p> is playing gin rummy with the Gunslinger. The brick of<br>
    gold sits on the table near the Hitman.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Can you deal me in?</p>
  <p> HITMAN<br>
    Sorry. It's a two-man game.</p>
  <p> Troi sees the gold brick, and reaches for it. The<br>
    Hitman grabs her wrist and pushes her hand back.</p>
  <p> HITMAN<br>
    Hey, hey, hey -- keep your hands<br>
    off that.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Is that why you killed the<br>
    Engineer -- to get this brick?</p>
  <p> HITMAN<br>
    I had to get it back. You know<br>
    how much it's worth, lady?<br>
    Plenty.<br>
    (taps it)<br>
    And I gotta get it to Keystone<br>
    City.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why? What's at Keystone City?</p>
  <p> The Hitman looks at her, amazed.</p>
  <p> HITMAN<br>
    That's where everything begins...</p>
  <p> He lays his cards on the table.</p>
  <p> HITMAN<br>
    Gin.</p>
  <p> Troi reacts -- the Hitman has laid down five identical<br>
    cards, each one with a picture of the strange, THREE-DIMENSIONAL<br>
    molecule on it.</p>

  <p>35 ANOTHER ANGLE - DATA AND WORF</p>
  <p> Worf has joined Data, who is kneeling on the floor with<br>
    his device.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Are you succeeding, Commander?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am ready to access the main<br>
    power grid.</p>
  <p> CONDUCTOR (O.S.)<br>
    Keystone City, next stop.</p>
  <p> Data and Worf turn to see the Conductor walking down<br>
    the aisle, calling out to the passengers, who are<br>
    reacting to the news with obvious excitement.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/18/94 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The Cnductor stops in front of Data and Worf. He looks<br>
    at them closely and raises an eyebrow -- he's annoyed,<br>
    but not violent like the last time.</p>
  <p> CONDUCTOR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Well, look who's back.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We do not want any trouble, sir.<br>
    We are simply... passengers.</p>
  <p> CONDUCTOR<br>
    Then I'm sure you wouldn't mind<br>
    showing me your tickets?</p>
  <p> Worf grits his teeth -- not again...</p>
  <p> CONDUCTOR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Right. Sorry, boys... You're<br>
    getting off right here...</p>
  <p> With his words, the train HISSES to a stop. The<br>
    Conductor begins to force Data and Worf toward the<br>
    door...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/18/94 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>36 TROI AND THE HITMAN</p>
  <p> He suddenly stands up, grabs the brick.</p>
  <p> HITMAN<br>
    This is my stop.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Wait -- tell me what happens at<br>
    Keystone City. Why are you taking<br>
    the brick there... ?</p>
  <p> But he doesn't answer, moves quickly for the EXIT.<br>
    Troi follows.</p>
  <p>37 INCLUDE DATA AND WORF</p>
  <p> who are still being pushed out by the Conductor. The<br>
    Hitman brushes past them and out the rear door. Troi<br>
    approaches.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I think we should follow that man.<br>
    That brick may be an important<br>
    clue...</p>
  <p> All three EXIT through the rear door...</p>
  <p>38 EXT. HOLODECK/NEW YORK STREET - BROOKLYN SUBWAY - DAY</p>
  <p> Troi, Data, and Worf emerge from the subway, walking up<br>
    the stairs into the middle of the street. The place is<br>
    completely deserted.</p>
  <p> Troi looks around in vain for the Hitman.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    Where did he go... ?</p>
  <p> Data immediately begins scanning the area with his<br>
    device. He moves out into the intersection...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/22/94 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>39 FOLLOW DATA</p>
  <p> as he carefully scans the street. He stops at a<br>
    MANHOLE COVER in the middle of the intersection.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I can access the power grid here.</p>
  <p> Data makes an adjustment to his device. Troi keeps<br>
    looking around, searching for the Hitman.</p>
  <p>40 THE MANHOLE COVER DISAPPEARS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> revealing a HIGH-TECH INTERFACE underneath. The border<br>
    shows the yellow lines of the Holodeck grid.</p>
  <p>41 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> as Data bends down and begins to hook his device into<br>
    the interface.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will attempt to depolarize the<br>
    grid by using a low-frequency<br>
    inversion field. That may<br>
    disengage the nodes without<br>
    destroying them.</p>
  <p> Troi, still looking, suddenly spots --</p>

  <p> as he moves furtively out of sight around a corner.</p>
  <p>43 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There he is. I'm going after him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am coming with you.</p>
  <p> Troi and Worf move away off-screen. Data continues to<br>
    work.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, out of nowhere, a 1940's era CHECKER TAXICAB<br>
    screeches around a corner, heading straight for Data...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - 02/17/94 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data moves quickly out of the way as the TAXI races<br>
    past, barely missing him. It drives out of sight,<br>
    disappearing around a corner.</p>
  <p> OFF Data's expression...</p>
  <p>44 EXT. HOLODECK/NY STREET - CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY</p>
  <p> It's the front of an apartment building. The MAIN DOOR<br>
    is surrounded by SCAFFOLDING -- it's been almost<br>
    entirely bricked-in, and there's a PILE OF BRICKS on<br>
    the ground in front of it. It's a strangely<br>
    incongruous site on this nice, finished residential<br>
    block.</p>
  <p> The Hitman appears from around a corner, moving quickly<br>
    towards the construction site. Troi and Worf arrive a<br>
    beat later.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What are you doing here?</p>
  <p> They cautiously move toward him as he locates a<br>
    particular spot on the bricked-in door. There's a HOLE<br>
    in the middle -- one brick is missing, purposefully<br>
    left out.</p>
  <p> The Hitman smiles and turns to them.</p>
  <p> HITMAN<br>
    Laying the foundation...</p>
  <p> The Hitman reaches into his coat and pulls out the gold<br>
    brick. He puts into the hole -- it fits perfectly.</p>
  <p>45 THE BRICK (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> For a moment, the brick GLOWS brightly with a strange,<br>
    unearthly light... when the glow fades, the gold brick<br>
    is no longer visible -- the face of the brick wall is<br>
    one continuous whole... it's complete.</p>
  <p>46 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> HITMAN<br>
    Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got<br>
    a train to catch.</p>

  <p>49 THE OBJECT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> on the floor, GLOWING. It is solid and semitransparent,<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm betting it all has something<br>
    to do with the object that's<br>
    forming in the Cargo Bay.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I think he's right, Captain. Look<br>
    at the common themes that are<br>
    playing out on the Holodeck. A<br>
    puzzle being put together... a<br>
    foundation being laid... a paper<br>
    doll being fashioned. All images<br>
    of something being constructed.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    that's being constructed -- atom<br>
    by atom.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is this object?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I have no idea. It's composed of<br>
    silica polymers, duranium, and a<br>
    few other compounds we can't<br>
    identify.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But creating it has put quite a<br>
    strain on our systems. Warp power<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor, were you able to draw<br>
    any other conclusions from your<br>
    experience on the Holodeck?<br>
    Anything that might help us handle<br>
    this situation?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I think the Holodeck is what might<br>
    be called the ship's<br>
    &quot;imagination.&quot; It's full of<br>
    fanciful, metaphoric imagery -- as<br>
    though it's having some kind of...<br>
    daydream. It may not make literal<br>
    sense... but symbolically there's<br>
    probably some kind of logic to it.</p>

    The characters you spoke to... do<br>
    they have any particular<br>
    significance?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I think they represent various<br>
    aspects of the ship. The<br>
    Engineer, for instance... may have<br>
    represented the navigational<br>
    system. The Gunslinger could be<br>
    the weapon system...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there any possibility that we<br>
    might be able to persuade them to<br>
    give back control of the ship?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm not sure it's possible to<br>
    reason with them. Many of them<br>
    seem genuinely unaware of what's<br>
    going on... and of their role in<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> She hesitates, trying to find the right words.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's as though this emergent<br>
    intelligence is still an infant...<br>
    acting on instinct, trying to<br>
    figure itself out as it goes. The<br>
    only source of experience it can<br>
    draw on is ours -- through our<br>
    Holodeck programs.</p>
  <p> Picard ponders the situation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there a way to... relate to<br>
    them on their own level...<br>
    influence their behavior in some<br>
    way... ?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go ahead, Counselor. But keep<br>

  <p> Worf hands the Conductor THREE TICKETS.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Three for Vertiform City.</p>

    standing in front of the brake lever and control box.<br>
    The Hitman has drawn his gun. The boiler is burning<br>
    brightly behind them.</p>
  <p> CONDUCTOR<br>
    All right, that's far enough.</p>
  <p> Data stops.</p>
  <p> HITMAN<br>
    Sorry to spoil your party, pal...<br>
    it's nothing personal.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/22/94 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>82 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I can get us there more quickly.<br>
    I know a shorter route.</p>
  <p> HITMAN<br>
    Don't listen to him -- he's up to<br>
    somethin'.</p>
  <p> CONDUCTOR<br>
    A shorter route... ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. If you will let me handle<br>
    the controls.</p>
  <p> HITMAN<br>
    Don't do it!</p>
  <p> CONDUCTOR<br>
    We're behind schedule now... if he<br>
    could get us there on time...</p>
  <p> The Conductor stares at Data, a moment of decision.<br>
    Then he gestures toward the controls.</p>
  <p> CONDUCTOR<br>
    Go on. But no funny stuff.</p>
  <p> Data taps his combadge.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Data to Captain Picard...</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>83 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker at command; Geordi at Aft Science.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I have taken control of the engine<br>
    room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stand by.<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Are we within sensor range of the<br>
    nebula?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/22/94 - ACT FIVE 58A.</p>
  <p>83 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Mister Data, try to slow us to<br>
    impulse speed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will attempt to do so.</p>
  <p> As Data puts a hand on the controls the Conductor takes<br>
    a step forward.</p>
  <p> CONDUCTOR<br>
    I sure hope you know what you're<br>
    doing...</p>
  <p> Data slowly pulls back the brake lever...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/18/94 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>84 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> drops out of warp. A NEBULA is visible in the<br>
    distance.</p>
  <p>85 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are the torpedo modifications<br>
    complete?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Launch torpedo.</p>
  <p> Geordi works the controls, and we hear the SOUND of the<br>
    torpedo launch.</p>
  <p>86 EXT. SPACE - THE TORPEDO (STOCK OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> blasts into the Nebula... a short beat later, the<br>
    Nebula explodes into a dazzling, shimmering GLOW.</p>
  <p>87 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off console)<br>
    It's working, sir... the<br>
    reaction's producing vertion<br>
    particles...</p>
  <p> Reactions.</p>
  <p>88 INT. HOLODECK/TRAIN - ENGINE ROOM</p>
  <p> Both the Conductor and the Hitman are looking curiously<br>
    out the window as Data watches them carefully.</p>
  <p> CONDUCTOR<br>
    (scratches his head)<br>
    Well, what do you know... we're<br>
    here...</p>
  <p> HITMAN<br>
    New Vertiform City...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/22/94 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>88 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The Conductor shrugs. He smiles and steps up to the<br>
    control box and sounds the STEAM WHISTLE.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>89 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A particle BEAM from the ship is tapping into the<br>
    glowing NEBULA.</p>
  <p>90 INT. CARGO BAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, Beverly, and Geordi are watching the Object --<br>
    it's almost fully formed now, and is GLOWING with a<br>
    strong, powerful radiance. As they look at the forming<br>
    Object in wonder, Riker ENTERS and moves to Picard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The nodes are deactivating all<br>
    over the ship. Our systems are<br>
    beginning to function normally<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then the purpose of the ship's<br>
    intelligence... was simply to<br>
    bring that life form into being...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There are entire species whose<br>
    sole purpose in life is to<br>
    reproduce. And when they finally<br>
    procreate... they die.</p>
  <p> As they share the moment...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, look...</p>
  <p> The Object is now complete. It RISES off the floor and<br>
    begins to SPARKLE with a transporter-like effect.</p>
  <p> Our people get one final, glimpse of the fully-formed<br>
    structure... weird, alien, beautiful... before the<br>
    Object DEMATERIALIZES...</p>
  <p>91 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> and REMATERIALIZES outside the ship. Then the Object<br>
    moves gently away and disappears into space.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/22/94 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>92 INT. HOLODECK/TRAIN - SALON CAR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> All the characters we've seen are in the car, champagne<br>
    glasses in hand, raised for a toast. Troi, Data and<br>
    Worf have joined them.</p>
  <p> CONDUCTOR<br>
    Cheers.</p>
  <p> As glasses touch -- the scene disappears.</p>
  <p>93 INT. HOLODECK</p>
  <p> Worf, Troi and Data are standing in an empty Holodeck.<br>
    OFF their expressions...</p>
  <p>94 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship at impulse across a field of stars.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, supplemental. The<br>
    Enterprise is back under our<br>
    control. All traces of the<br>
    emergent intelligence are gone...<br>
    and the object it created has<br>
    disappeared into space...</p>
  <p>95 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard is working at his computer when the door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> The DOOR OPENS and Data ENTERS.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, I am staging a scene from<br>
    The Tempest this evening for a<br>
    small audience. I would like you<br>
    to attend.</p>
  <p> Picard stands from the desk.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'd be honored. Which scene?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Miranda's first encounter with<br>
    other human beings.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/17/94 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>95 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    &quot;Oh brave new world that has such<br>
    people in it.&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It seemed appropriate.</p>
  <p> Data pauses a beat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain. You took a significant<br>
    risk in allowing the Enterprise to<br>
    complete its... task.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why do you say that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Because the end product was<br>
    unknown. The object could have<br>
    been dangerous. It may in fact,<br>
    be dangerous...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And I've allowed it to go off on<br>
    its merry way.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard considers for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The intelligence that formed on<br>
    the Enterprise... it didn't just<br>
    come out of the ship's systems --<br>
    it came out of us. Our mission<br>
    records, our personal logs, even<br>
    our Holodeck programs -- our<br>
    fantasies.</p>
  <p> Picard steps over to the window and stares out.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    If our experiences with the<br>
    Enterprise have been honorable...</p>
  <p> He turns back to Data.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Emergence&quot; - REV. 02/17/94 - ACT FIVE 63.</p>
  <p>95 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Then can't we trust the sum of<br>
    those experiences to be the same?</p>
  <p> Data reflects for a moment, then nods, turns and leaves<br>
    the Ready Room. Picard glances again out the window,<br>
    sits back down at his computer and gets back to work...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
