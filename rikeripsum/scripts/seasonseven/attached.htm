  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE</p>
  <p> Orbiting an Earth-sized, blue-green planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log: Stardate 47304.2.<br>
    The Enterprise has arrived at<br>
    Kesprytt Three in order to<br>
    evaluate an unusual request on the<br>
    part of the Kes for associate<br>
    membership in the Federation.</p>
  <p>2 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> PICARD and BEVERLY are seated at the table, finishing<br>
    up the last remnants of a large breakfast. The fare<br>
    this morning consists of some strange-looking soup with<br>
    the consistency of molasses and plates of exotic<br>
    fruits. Beverly eats heartily, thoroughly enjoying<br>
    every bite -- Picard is somewhat restrained... making<br>
    vague motions at the soup and mostly contenting himself<br>
    with a cup of tea and a biscuit.</p>
  <p> Picard seems a little distracted, but otherwise, the<br>
    atmosphere is very casual and relaxed.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    She's been very secretive... every<br>
    time I ask her about it or try to<br>
    edge around the subject, she<br>
    changes the subject. Personally,<br>
    I think she's in love.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mmmmm.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Didn't you hear me? I said, she's<br>
    in love.</p>
  <p> Picard's not sure what sort of response Beverly's<br>
    looking for.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Attached&quot; - 09/07/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Is that all you can say?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What would you like me to say?<br>
    I'm very pleased for them both.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Both of who?</p>
  <p> Picard thinks for a moment... but he has no idea.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The two... people we were<br>
    discussing.</p>
  <p> Beverly gives him a look and after a beat, she leans<br>
    forward with a mock-scolding look on her face.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (with a smile)<br>
    You don't have the slightest idea<br>
    who I'm talking about, do you?</p>
  <p> Picard finally drops all pretense and laughs as he<br>
    picks up a cup of tea.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (laughing)<br>
    No... no, I'm sorry... but I<br>
    really don't.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    I'll try not to take that<br>
    personally... I've been talking<br>
    about Nurse Ogawa and Ensign<br>
    Markson for almost fifteen<br>
    minutes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh, now it hasn't been that long.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How would you know? You haven't<br>
    heard a thing I've said since I<br>
    got here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're right. I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Are you worried about this mission<br>
    with the Kes?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Attached&quot; - REV. 09/07/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Beverly's hit it on the head. Picard picks up his cup<br>
    of tea and leans back in his chair.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not worried exactly... just<br>
    uneasy. This notion of admitting<br>
    half of their planet to the<br>
    Federation while leaving the other<br>
    half out...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well, first of all, the Kes are<br>
    not half the planet, they're<br>
    almost three-quarters of it. And<br>
    the Prytt are not being left out --<br>
    they simply don't want any outside<br>
    contact with the Federation or<br>
    anyone else.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Every member of the Federation has<br>
    entered as a unified world... and<br>
    that unity said something about<br>
    them... that they had resolved<br>
    certain social and political<br>
    problems at home and were ready to<br>
    join a larger community.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    From all indications, the Kes are<br>
    a very unified, very progressive<br>
    people.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But the Prytt are not. They are<br>
    reclusive to the point of<br>
    xenophobia.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Think about Earth -- what if one<br>
    of the old nation-states, say<br>
    Australia, had decided not to join<br>
    the World Government in twenty-one<br>
    fifty? Would that have<br>
    disqualified us from being a<br>
    Federation member?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That analogy is not entirely --</p>

    Go ahead, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    We've received word from<br>
    Ambassador Mauric that he's ready<br>
    to see you and Doctor Crusher.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Inform him we're on our way.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Acknowledged.</p>
  <p> Picard gets up and puts his jacket on. Beverly grabs<br>
    a couple more bites of soup as she grabs her lab coat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you for breakfast.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Wait until tomorrow... I have<br>
    something very special planned.<br>
    It's a Vulcan dish -- that's all<br>
    I'll tell you.</p>
  <p> They EXIT.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>3 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> WORF is working at the console along with a N.D.<br>
    Crewmember as Beverly and Picard ENTER.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain. Doctor. I have the<br>
    coordinates of Ambassador Mauric's<br>
    chambers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's not keep them waiting,<br>
    Mister Worf.</p>

  <p> The Transporter Chief works the console and Beverly and<br>
    Picard DEMATERIALIZE. A beat passes and Worf heads for<br>

    This is Security Relay Station<br>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>4 INT. DARK CELL</p>
  <p> A small, dingy prison cell -- damp and inhospitable.</p>
  <p> Picard lies prone on the floor. Beverly is propped up<br>
    against a wall. Both are unconscious.</p>
  <p> Slowly, Picard begins to come to his senses. Shaking<br>
    the cobwebs out of his head. He spots Beverly.<br>
    Realizes something terrible's happened. He tries to<br>
    key his insignia, but it's nowhere to be found.</p>
  <p> Picard moves to Beverly's side and gently shakes her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Beverly... Beverly...</p>
  <p> Her eyes flutter open.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The last thing I remember... was<br>
    beginning the transport...</p>
  <p> Picard unsteadily stands and begins to look around the<br>
    room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I would assume that we're on<br>
    Kesprytt... in some kind of<br>
    prison cell.</p>
  <p> He turns his back to Beverly and examines the closed<br>
    door to the cell.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The question is why? I can't<br>
    imagine that Ambassador Mauric<br>
    would --</p>
  <p> Beverly reacts in alarm to something she sees on the<br>
    back of Picard's head.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Attached&quot; - REV. 09/08/93 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> He reacts to the look on her face.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm not sure.</p>
  <p> Beverly stands and moves to him. She turns his head<br>
    around and now we can see some kind of electronic<br>
    IMPLANT at the base of his neck. Beverly examines it<br>
    gingerly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's an implant... looks like it<br>
    might be connected directly to the<br>
    brainstem.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Some kind of coercive device... ?</p>
  <p> Beverly reaches behind her own neck with a hand... then<br>
    nods -- she has one too.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Whatever they are... I doubt<br>
    they're designed for our health.</p>
  <p> The door to the cell suddenly slides OPEN and MINISTER<br>
    LORIN ENTERS. She is a tall, elegant, woman dressed in<br>
    sleek military regalia. Lorin scans them both with a<br>
    Kes version of a tricorder. TWO ARMED GUARDS step into<br>
    the cell with her and the door CLOSES behind them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why are we being held?</p>
  <p> But Lorin is more interested in the readings on her<br>
    device than in answering Picard's questions. She<br>
    continues to work the small tricorder.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Attached&quot; - 09/07/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If you tell us why you've taken us<br>
    hostage, we might be able to --</p>
  <p> Lorin flatly and unemotionally cuts her off without<br>
    looking up.</p>
  <p> LORIN<br>
    You are not hostages. You are<br>
    prisoners.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Prisoners. By whose authority?</p>
  <p> Lorin closes her tricorder with a snap and then eyes<br>
    them with the dull interest of a keeper checking over<br>
    an exhibit.</p>
  <p> LORIN<br>
    You are being held under the<br>
    authority of the Prytt Security<br>
    Ministry. The charge is<br>
    conspiring with the enemy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The enemy... you mean the Kes.</p>
  <p> LORIN<br>
    We are not fools. We are aware of<br>
    the Federation attempt to<br>
    establish a military alliance with<br>
    the Kes. It will not be<br>
    tolerated.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your information is in error.<br>
    There are no plans to enter into<br>
    any --</p>
  <p> LORIN<br>
    There is no point in trying to<br>
    mislead us, Captain. The devices<br>
    which have been implanted in your<br>
    cerebral cortexes will soon be<br>
    calibrated to your psi-wave<br>
    patterns. At that time, we will<br>
    get all the information we need.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Attached&quot; - REV. 09/09/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And you will discover that we're<br>
    telling the truth.</p>
  <p> Lorin gives him a polite and tolerant smile.</p>
  <p> LORIN<br>
    We shall see.</p>
  <p> Lorin now taps in a command on her tricorder, and the<br>
    door OPENS again. She and the Guards EXIT.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship in orbit.</p>
  <p>6 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> DATA is on the platform, examining a raised section of<br>
    the Transporter with a tricorder. Worf and RIKER are<br>
    standing at the console.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is nothing wrong with the<br>
    Transporter. I have run a<br>
    complete diagnostic and checked<br>
    all the targeting components.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then what happened to the Captain<br>
    and Doctor Crusher?</p>
  <p> Worf reacts to something on the console.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Commander. The Transporter sensor<br>
    log shows an unusual concentration<br>
    of antigraviton particles in the<br>
    emitter coil. These particles do<br>
    not occur naturally -- something<br>
    must have interfered with the<br>
    Transporter.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Interfered?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Attached&quot; - REV. 09/08/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A concentration of antigraviton<br>
    particles would suggest a tractor<br>
    beam. It might have deflected the<br>
    Transporter beam to a different<br>
    set of coordinates.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is there a way to locate those<br>
    coordinates?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, sir.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    However, it may be possible to<br>
    determine the point of origin of<br>
    the tractor beam itself.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well, that's a start.</p>
  <p> Data begins to work the console as the others crowd<br>
    around to watch. After a beat, Data has an answer.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The tractor beam originated from<br>
    somewhere within the Prytt<br>
    Alliance.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Prytt... things just got a<br>
    little more complicated.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Can we scan for them?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (shakes his head)<br>
    Prytt territory is shielded by a<br>
    high-energy forcefield. It cannot<br>
    be penetrated by our sensors.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Why would the Prytt want Captain<br>
    Picard and Doctor Crusher?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Attached&quot; - 09/07/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't know. And it's not going<br>
    to be easy to find out... the<br>
    Prytt have consistently refused<br>
    all outside contact and somehow I<br>
    don't think they're going to be<br>
    eager to start now. We'll have to<br>
    work through the Kes.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Contact Ambassador Mauric and tell<br>
    him we need a meeting right away.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf heads for the door.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>7 INT. DARK CELL</p>
  <p> Picard is meticulously studying one section of the cell<br>
    wall with infinite patience... he's looking for any way<br>
    out of here. Beverly is sitting calmly against one<br>
    wall watching him. They've been here for quite some<br>
    time. After a few beats, Picard stops probing the wall<br>
    and turns around to give Beverly a questioning look.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (confused)<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're staring at me.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Sorry. I was just wondering how<br>
    long you were going to keep at<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (returns to the wall)<br>
    As long as it takes. With any<br>
    luck, there may be a structural<br>
    flaw that would allow us to<br>
    escape.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (without conviction)<br>
    Right.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Attached&quot; - 09/07/93 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Beverly's confidence is clearly low, but Picard<br>
    concentrates on the wall and refuses to concede an<br>
    inch.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The important thing during any<br>

    it is simply a matter of --</p>
  <p> Suddenly the door slides OPEN again and a Guard ENTERS,<br>
    carrying a food tray. Beverly gets to her feet and<br>
    Picard tenses, looking for an opening. But the Guard<br>
    is wary and careful... he keeps his weapon out and<br>
    ready as he sets the food tray down on the floor, never<br>
    taking his eyes off the prisoners. The Guard then<br>
    slowly backs out the door, which then CLOSES behind<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> As the door slides into the wall, Picard jumps to the<br>
    doorway and tries to keep the mechanism from completely<br>
    closing, but it's no use and the door CLICKS shut.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Damn.</p>
  <p> Picard examines the door frame.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well, at least this means we're<br>
    not going to starve to death.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (grim)<br>
    What it means is that they plan on<br>
    keeping us here for a while...</p>
  <p> Beverly takes a deep breath... she hadn't considered<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm starting to think negatively,<br>
    Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> A few silent beats pass... Beverly finally looks at the<br>
    food tray... she picks up the lid out of curiosity and<br>
    is shocked to find her own MEDICAL TRICORDER sitting on<br>
    the plate.</p>

    picks up the tricorder and opens it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Does it work?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (works)<br>
    Yes. But something's been added<br>
    to the main directory.</p>
  <p>8 INSERT (OPTICAL)</p>

    The tiny monitor displays a complicated map with a path<br>

    Agreed. Is there a way to open<br>
    the cell door?</p>
  <p> Beverly checks the tricorder for a beat.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes. The code's been entered.</p>
  <p> Picard nods and Beverly points the tricorder at the<br>
    cell door. She works for a moment... then the door<br>
    slides OPEN. Picard moves quickly to the doorway...<br>
    pokes his head outside... takes a quick look around,<br>

  <p>10 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Riker, Worf, and TROI are sitting at the table with<br>
    AMBASSADOR MAURIC. The Ambassador is a distinguished,<br>
    impressive-looking humanoid, with all the charm of a<br>
    refined southern gentleman. Mauric is accompanied by<br>
    an AIDE, who stands neatly at attention behind Mauric's<br>
    chair.</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    On behalf of my government, I<br>
    would like to take this<br>
    opportunity to present our<br>
    profound apologizes to you<br>
    regarding this unfortunate<br>
    incident.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's very kind, Ambassador. But<br>
    I don't think anyone here blames<br>
    you or the Kes government for<br>
    what's happened.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Our primary concern is not to<br>
    assign blame, but to recover our<br>
    missing officers.</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    Of course.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We are prepared to insert a<br>
    hostage rescue team into the Prytt<br>
    capital city on three hours<br>
    notice.</p>
  <p> Riker and Troi exchange a surprised look.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ambassador... we haven't even<br>
    tried a diplomatic effort yet.<br>
    I'd rather not use force until<br>
    we've exhausted all other options.</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    I don't believe we have any...<br>
    diplomatic options, Commander.<br>
    There are no formal relations with<br>
    the Prytt...<br>

  <p> MAURIC (Cont'd)<br>
    ... no ambassadors... there's<br>
    simply no way to contact them.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Surely you must have some means of<br>
    communication in case of a<br>
    planetary emergency.</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    We have never had need of such a<br>
    system.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We can determine their<br>
    communications frequencies and<br>
    establish a link.</p>
  <p> Mauric hesitates... he's trying very hard not to offend<br>
    his hosts here, but he knows all this will go nowhere.</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    Allow me to be blunt.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The Prytt are a fanatical,<br>
    xenophobic people, with little<br>
    regard for civilized discourse.<br>
    Even if you do establish a<br>
    communications link with them, it<br>
    will be a complete waste of time.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How long has it been since your<br>
    last diplomatic contact?</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    Almost a century.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Then it's possible that they've<br>
    changed over the years.</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    (a tolerant smile)<br>
    We have had other... less formal<br>
    contacts with the Prytt --<br>
    contacts that I cannot discuss.<br>
    But I can assure you, they have<br>
    changed very little.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Ambassador... with all due<br>
    respect, I feel I should make an<br>
    attempt to communicate with the<br>
    Prytt before I sanction the use of<br>
    force.</p>
  <p> Mauric smiles easily.</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    Of course, Commander. In the<br>
    meantime, I will continue to make<br>
    preparations for a rescue attempt.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Agreed.</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    I do have one request. We believe<br>
    that the Prytt obtained their<br>
    information about the transport of<br>
    your captain and doctor through a<br>
    breach in our communications<br>
    network. If I could set up a base<br>
    of operations here on the<br>
    Enterprise, I would feel much more<br>
    secure.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    looks up and down the corridor... into the room.</p>

    What?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm thirsty too.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I didn't say anything about being<br>
    thirsty.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I heard you. You said, &quot;I'm very<br>
    thirsty.&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was thinking about it, but I<br>
    didn't say anything.</p>
  <p> They regard each other silently for a moment as a new<br>
    thought dawns on them both.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You were thinking it...</p>

    our thoughts.<br>

    What am I thinking?</p>
  <p> A beat as Picard concentrates.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can't hear your thoughts,<br>
    either. Maybe it was just a<br>
    fluke.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    For now, I'm afraid we have more<br>
    immediate concerns. Does the map<br>
    indicate a way out of here?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes. We go up.</p>
  <p> She gestures to the rock face of the chamber.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There's a ledge about thirty<br>
    meters up that connects to another<br>
    tunnel which should lead to the<br>
    surface.</p>
  <p> Picard takes this in matter-of-factly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Right.</p>
  <p> He moves to the rockface and begins looking for his<br>
    first hand-hold. Beverly remains where she is, looking<br>
    up at the rockface towering above her. Picard turns<br>
    after a moment, a surprised look on his face.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I heard that.<br>
    (off her look)<br>
    They weren't words exactly... I<br>
    suddenly had this... sense of<br>
    fear... a fear of heights.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    So much for it being a fluke.</p>
  <p> Picard is taken aback by the experience.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What a strange sensation... your<br>
    thoughts just appeared in my mind.</p>
  <p> Beverly manages a wan smile and looks up at the<br>
    rockface.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If you sensed fear of heights, you<br>
    sensed pretty accurately.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles and steers her toward the wall.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come on. We've done this<br>
    before... it's just like on the<br>
    Holodeck.<br>
    (takes her hand and puts<br>
    it on rock)<br>
    One hand-hold at a time... nothing<br>
    too fast... just a slow, gentle<br>
    climb.</p>

  <p>15 INT. KES QUARTERS</p>
  <p> The room has been changed from the usual guest<br>
    accommodations. Some of the furniture has been shoved<br>
    over to one side and the room is littered with SEVERAL<br>
    ELECTRONIC DEVICES. The desk now supports a large<br>
    ALIEN COMPUTER console with odd cabling and gizmos<br>
    attached to it.</p>
  <p> The Aide seen earlier is working at a console.</p>
  <p> Ambassador Mauric and Riker ENTER. As soon as Riker is<br>
    in the room, the Aide immediately picks up a Kes<br>
    tricorder, moves to him, and begins to scan Riker up<br>
    and down. Riker looks around the room with a little<br>
    surprise.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I see you've done some<br>
    redecorating.</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    Just a few pieces of equipment we<br>
    needed for security reasons. You<br>
    understand.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Certainly.</p>
  <p> The Aide finishes his scan of Riker.</p>
  <p> AIDE<br>
    He is all right.</p>
  <p> Mauric indicates a chair and he and Riker sit down. As<br>
    Riker gets near the Kes equipment in the room, the Aide<br>
    quietly moves about and turns the equipment OFF so that<br>
    Riker can't see any of the screens.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ambassador... how do you plan to<br>
    get my people out of Prytt<br>
    territory?</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    You must realize that what I am<br>
    about to tell you cannot leave<br>
    this room.<br>
    (off his nod)<br>
    For some time now, we have had<br>
    certain... friends among the<br>
    Prytt. Citizens who have realized<br>
    that the long struggle between our<br>
    two peoples can only end when the<br>
    Prytt government is made to see<br>
    reason.</p>

  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You've recruited a few Prytt<br>
    spies.</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    A crude, but accurate term. These<br>
    friends will be waiting for your<br>
    Captain and Doctor when they reach<br>
    the village of Ohn-Kor near the<br>
    Kes border. The map we provided<br>
    your officers will take them to a<br>
    tavern there.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Forgive me, Ambassador, but is it<br>
    wise to send two human fugitives<br>
    in Starfleet uniforms into a Prytt<br>
    village?</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    The danger is minimal. Our<br>
    operatives control most of the<br>
    town.</p>
  <p> Riker isn't entirely happy with that answer, but Mauric<br>
    continues.</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Once they have made contact with<br>
    Captain Picard and Doctor Crusher,<br>
    our friends will escort them<br>
    across the Kes border.</p>

  <p>15 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Riker absorbs this, still worried about the danger to<br>
    Beverly and the Captain.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'd still feel better if they<br>
    could rendezvous with your<br>
    operatives in a less public place.</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    Commander, I assure you we know<br>
    what we're doing. We have a great<br>
    deal of experience in dealing with<br>
    the Prytt. And we would hardly<br>
    risk the safety of your people...<br>
    after all -- we're still hoping<br>
    you'll recommend our entrance into<br>
    the Federation.</p>
  <p> This makes sense, and Riker accepts it. But he's still<br>
    bothered.</p>

  <p> Picard and Beverly come out from the caves. They blink<br>
    for a moment in the bright sunshine, then Beverly<br>
    points in a direction and they head out...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>17 EXT. SLOPE - DAY</p>
  <p> Picard and Beverly carefully make their way down a<br>
    tricky slope... picking through the brush, always<br>
    looking around for any sign of pursuit. They look<br>
    worn, tired and hungry. Silence for a while...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    One of us is hungry.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That would be me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Try to think of something else.<br>
    You're making me hungry.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What would you like me to think<br>
    about?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Something other than a large bowl<br>
    of vegetable soup.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (with relish)<br>
    My grandmother used to make it...<br>
    with beans and peas and carrots --</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Sorry.</p>
  <p> Picard suddenly pulls up short and glares at her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (having &quot;heard&quot; her)<br>
    I am not being unreasonable.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I didn't say you were. I may have<br>
    thought it, but there's a<br>
    difference.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a beat... tries to clear his head for a<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're right. We can't react to<br>
    every random thought that crosses<br>
    the other person's mind.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It's astonishing how much...<br>
    clutter there is in our<br>
    consciousness. Odd memories<br>
    coming to the surface... bits of<br>
    half-remembered songs...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Stray day-dreams... scattered<br>
    minutiae... I wonder how true<br>
    telepaths sift through it all.<br>
    How can they get to what someone's<br>
    really thinking if their minds are<br>
    constantly churning all this<br>
    flotsam to the surface?</p>
  <p> A beat. Beverly suddenly reacts to something she<br>
    &quot;hears.&quot;</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That is not funny.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    I just wanted to see if you were<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I think the link is getting<br>
    stronger.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Maybe we should put some distance<br>
    between us... that might weaken<br>
    it.<br>

  <p>17 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Certainly not.</p>
  <p> They share a smile and then Beverly takes a few strides<br>
    away from him. She gets about five or six feet away...<br>
    then suddenly they both stagger and double over, hit by<br>
    a wave of dizziness and nausea.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jean-Luc...</p>
  <p> He has to crawl to get to her... but as he does, the<br>
    sickness starts to fade. As he gets to her, he's fine<br>
    and so is she. Beverly pulls out her tricorder and<br>
    scans them both.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't know... I suddenly felt a<br>
    wave of nausea.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Me too.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    I don't see anything wrong with<br>
    either of us.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Maybe the air is toxic...</p>
  <p> Beverly gets up and takes a few steps, scanning, but<br>
    quickly the nausea returns and she retreats back toward<br>
    Picard and it passes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The same thing... but when you<br>
    moved back toward me... I felt<br>
    better.</p>
  <p> They stare at each other for a moment, the implications<br>
    of this sinking in. He smiles gamely at her, trying to<br>
    downplay the situation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It would seem we're stuck with<br>
    each other.</p>
  <p> OFF their faces...</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>18 EXT. RAVINE - DAY</p>
  <p> A short time later. Beverly and Picard are walking<br>
    along and then come to a stop. (From this point on,<br>
    they should be no more than three feet apart at any<br>
    time.) Beverly checks her map and frowns.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's wrong?</p>
  <p> Beverly points at two different mountain ridges.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can't tell if we're supposed to<br>
    go over this hill... or that one.<br>
    The topography on this map is a<br>
    little vague.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let me see.</p>
  <p> Picard takes the tricorder and examines the map and the<br>
    distant ridge line. A beat, then he points in<br>
    direction.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing,<br>
    confidently)<br>
    This way.</p>
  <p> He takes a step, but Beverly stays in place.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You don't really know, do you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're acting like you know<br>
    exactly which way to go... but<br>
    you're just guessing. Do you do<br>
    this all the time?</p>
  <p> Picard's been caught, but he takes it with good grace.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No.<br>

    But... there are times when it's<br>
    important for a Captain to give<br>
    the appearance of confidence.</p>
  <p> Beverly smiles and they resume their walk.</p>
  <p> After a beat, Picard &quot;hears&quot; something -- he turns and<br>
    looks at her in surprise. Beverly laughs and holds up<br>
    her hands.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I<br>
    couldn't resist...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm beginning to realize that you<br>
    seem to always have some...<br>
    acerbic remark on the tip of your<br>
    tongue.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    At least I've trained myself not<br>
    to say it anymore. When I was a<br>
    little girl, my mouth was always<br>
    landing me in trouble with my<br>
    parents... my teachers...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (reading her thoughts)<br>
    Your friends... and someone named<br>
    Tom Norris... ?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    That's right. We had one date...<br>
    which I brought to an abrupt halt<br>
    with the words... &quot;Is that a beard<br>
    or is your face dirty?&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (overlapping)<br>
    &quot;Or is your face dirty?&quot;</p>
  <p> They both laugh for a moment... then Picard senses<br>
    something else.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's something more... you're<br>
    laughing, but...<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    You actually feel... embarrassed<br>
    about that incident.</p>

    I thought I was being cute... but<br>
    I really hurt him.</p>
  <p> A few beats pass and they silently look at each other,<br>
    unspoken words travel back and forth. Beverly breaks<br>
    the silence and tries to shake off the moment.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That was a long time ago. And it<br>
    taught me a valuable lesson.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    We'd better get going.</p>
  <p> They head out again.</p>
  <p>19 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Picard is alarmed by something he sees in the<br>
    distance. He's about to say something to Beverly, but<br>
    she whirls around without his saying anything. They<br>
    both duck behind some brush for cover and then<br>
    cautiously peek out.</p>

    I don't think so, either. Maybe<br>
    there's another way to reach the<br>

  <p> Beverly hands him the tricorder without looking --<br>
    again, responding to an unseen &quot;thought.&quot; Picard<br>
    studies the tricorder for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. We'd have to backtrack<br>
    several kilometers to find another<br>
    way over this ridge.</p>
  <p> Beat. Then Picard makes a decision.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    The border's only two kilometers<br>
    east of here... there's a<br>
    forcefield protecting it, but<br>
    we'll have to find a way to deal<br>

  <p> Riker and Worf ENTER and are immediately confronted by<br>
    the Aide, who uses a Kes tricorder to carefully and<br>
    thoroughly scan both Riker and Worf from head to toe.<br>
    Mauric is seated at the table, his hands folded neatly<br>
    in front of him while TWO N.D. Aides stand on either<br>
    side of him. Mauric is looking at the Enterprise<br>
    officers with a cool eye. Riker and Worf exchange a<br>
    glance -- what's this all about?</p>
  <p> The Aide finishes his scan and turns back to Mauric.</p>
  <p> AIDE<br>
    (to Mauric)<br>
    All right.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Mauric)<br>
    Is something wrong?</p>
  <p> Mauric looks at them both for a long beat... his<br>
    friendly and open demeanor is now gone -- he's<br>
    completely neutral and unreadable. After a long beat,<br>
    he gestures to two chairs.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you know what happened to them?</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    No. We have no idea what happened<br>
    to them.<br>

    We find it strange that your<br>
    officers would follow the escape<br>

    Our sources would have informed us<br>
    instantly if that had happened.<br>

    A different rendezvous? I'm not<br>

  <p> MAURIC<br>

    you ask us for help... and get us<br>
    to expose several of our<br>
    undercover operatives in the<br>
    process. But what you didn't<br>
    expect was for us to get your<br>
    people out of prison so quickly.<br>
    They needed more time... more time<br>
    to plot the destruction of the Kes<br>
    with their new Prytt friends.</p>
  <p> Riker's had enough of this. He gets to his feet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is ridiculous. You're<br>
    starting to see conspiracies<br>
    everywhere. We were invited here<br>
    by the Kes, why would we want to<br>
    ally ourselves with the Prytt?</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    Why indeed?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You can believe what you want...<br>
    we're going to find our people<br>
    with or without your help.</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    Then I believe it's time for us to<br>
    be leaving the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: equipment)<br>
    Just make sure you take all that<br>
    junk with you.</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf EXIT.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>25 EXT. CUL DE SAC - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Beverly and Picard have stopped for the night in a<br>
    small Cul de Sac, shielded from view by rocks and<br>
    vegetation. Picard is tending a small FIRE as Beverly<br>
    sits nearby scanning a collection of plants with her<br>
    tricorder. After a beat, she reacts with<br>
    disappointment -- Picard doesn't have to see her to<br>
    know what's wrong.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No luck.</p>

  <p>25 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm beginning to think there's not<br>
    a single thing on this planet we<br>
    can eat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well... if we're lucky, we'll be<br>
    back on the Enterprise by this<br>
    time tomorrow and you can plant<br>
    yourself in front of a replicator<br>
    with a knife and fork.</p>
  <p> She smiles as Picard sits down.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Remember that Vulcan dish I<br>
    promised you for breakfast? I was<br>
    just thinking...</p>
  <p> She trails off... suddenly struck by something she<br>
    &quot;hears&quot; from Picard.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing, surprised)<br>
    You hate having breakfast with me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's not true.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes, it is. As soon as I said,<br>
    &quot;breakfast&quot; I heard you say, &quot;I<br>
    hate that.&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's not quite what I meant...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well, what did you mean?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I simply... don't like...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (&quot;hearing&quot; him)<br>
    ... don't like what I've been<br>
    choosing for breakfast.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, no. It's... just that I feel<br>
    breakfast should be... a simple<br>
    meal... and recently they seem to<br>
    have become more elaborate.</p>

    (&quot;hearing&quot; him)<br>
    Tea and scones. That's all you<br>
    really want, isn't it? Tea and<br>
    scones. Why didn't you say so?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It didn't seem that important...</p>
  <p> Suddenly he stops as he &quot;hears&quot; something from her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You don't like those elaborate<br>
    meals either.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (laughs)<br>
    I usually prefer something simple<br>
    myself... but somehow I thought<br>
    you might enjoy more variety.</p>
  <p> They both share a laugh.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Well, it's tea and scones for both<br>
    of us from now on.</p>
  <p> They both smile and sit back. They are very<br>
    comfortable here... very much at ease with each other.<br>
    A long silent beat passes as they look into the fire.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I love firelight.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (overlapping)<br>
    I love firelight.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's something about the<br>
    flame... the smell of the<br>
    smoke... I've always felt it's<br>
    intoxicating in a way...</p>

    I remember when Jack and I took<br>
    Wesley on his first camping trip<br>
    to Balfour Lake. Wesley kept<br>
    throwing manta leaves in the fire<br>
    to watch them pop... Jack kept<br>
    telling him...</p>
  <p> She trails off... and slowly looks at Picard with a<br>
    very shocked and puzzled look on her face. She just<br>
    &quot;heard&quot; a fragment of something very important. Picard<br>
    stares resolutely into the fire.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> He doesn't answer.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing, gently)<br>
    Jean-Luc... I heard you. Don't<br>
    push it away.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Beverly, please. I don't want to<br>
    talk about this right now.</p>
  <p> But Beverly isn't about to let this go. She moves<br>
    closer to him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    When I said, &quot;Jack and I&quot;... I<br>
    could feel this sudden wave of...<br>
    something.<br>
    (beat, then surprised)<br>
    I never knew you felt that way.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Didn't you?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I guess I always knew there was...<br>
    an attraction between us, right<br>
    from the start. But I had no idea<br>
    how strongly you felt...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Why didn't you ever tell me you<br>
    were in love with me?</p>

  <p>25 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Picard stops trying to get away from this... these are<br>
    things that he's never confronted directly and this is<br>
    very difficult for him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You were married to my best<br>
    friend.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    At first, it seemed like a<br>
    harmless infatuation... something<br>
    more hormonal than emotional. But<br>
    then...</p>
  <p> He trails off and Beverly picks up the thought.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (&quot;hearing&quot; more)<br>
    But then as the months went by...<br>
    and the three of us starting<br>
    spending more time together...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I began to realize that it was<br>
    something more.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It wasn't right... and I knew I<br>
    wouldn't act on it... but I<br>
    couldn't help the way I felt.</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (&quot;hearing&quot; more)<br>
    And when Jack died... you felt<br>
    guilty.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I felt guilty before he died...<br>
    having those kind of feelings for<br>
    my best friend's wife. Then...<br>
    later, after the accident... I<br>
    told myself that no matter what<br>
    happened I would never let you<br>
    know how I felt.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You didn't want to feel as if you<br>
    were...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Betraying my friend...</p>

    the Enterprise seven years ago.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I didn't know how I would react.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But gradually, I found that I<br>
    didn't feel that way anymore...<br>
    that twenty years was indeed a<br>
    long time...</p>

    And now we're friends...</p>
  <p> Another beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes... friends.</p>
  <p> They look at each other. They've shared something very<br>
    profound and intimate and Picard seems disquieted.<br>
    Beverly regards him for a moment, then turns away.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We still have a lot of ground to<br>
    cover tomorrow. We should get<br>
    some sleep.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Right.</p>
  <p> They both lie down by the fire and get comfortable.<br>
    The two of them lie on their back, looking up at the<br>
    sky. After a beat, Picard puts out his arm, and<br>
    Beverly puts her head on his shoulder. She closes her<br>
    eyes, but his remain open, staring up at the sky.</p>

  <p>26 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Data, and Worf at their stations. Mauric ENTERS<br>
    from the Turbolift. His attitude is cool toward<br>
    Riker... he clearly doesn't trust him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ambassador. Thank you for coming.</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're about to clear up this<br>
    misunderstanding once and for all.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Hail Minister Lorin, please.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf works and then Lorin appears on the Viewscreen.</p>
  <p> LORIN<br>
    Enterprise, I have warned you<br>
    about these unauthorized<br>
    communications...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, I know. But I think it's<br>
    about time we all sat down<br>
    together and tried to work this<br>
    out. I have Ambassador Mauric<br>
    here and --</p>
  <p> LORIN<br>
    That is your misfortune. We have<br>
    nothing to say to either of you.</p>
  <p> Lorin ENDS the transmission.</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Commander... I know you're working<br>
    with the Prytt. Putting on a<br>
    little show like that for my<br>
    benefit does neither of us any<br>
    good.</p>
  <p> Riker seems very unperturbed by this and he gives<br>
    Mauric a calm smile.</p>

    Riker and nods.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Mauric)<br>
    I think there's someone waiting<br>
    for us in the Observation Lounge.</p>
  <p> Riker gestures toward the door... after a puzzled beat,<br>
    Mauric heads in the indicated direction and they both<br>
    EXIT to...</p>
  <p>27 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Riker and Mauric ENTER and find a very angry Minister<br>
    Lorin standing in the room. She is keeps a handle on<br>
    her temper, but she is coldly furious.</p>
  <p> LORIN<br>
    I should have known that anyone<br>
    willing to deal with the Kes would<br>
    be capable of such an outrage.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sorry I had to resort to these<br>
    drastic measures, Minister, but<br>
    you left me little choice.</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    Don't pretend that the two of you<br>
    are enemies. It is too late for<br>
    a charade.</p>
  <p> LORIN<br>
    If that is an attempt to hide your<br>
    military alliance with the<br>
    Federation, you needn't bother.<br>
    I already know far more than you<br>
    can imagine.</p>
  <p> Riker tries to get control of the situation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's all just sit down and try to<br>
    talk about what's happened to<br>
    Captain Picard and Doctor Crusher.</p>

  <p> MAURIC<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    No more than I would sit with her.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All right... then we'll stand.<br>
    The important thing is that we<br>
    start talking.</p>
  <p> LORIN<br>
    I am not authorized to talk with<br>
    a Kes official.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    officers?</p>

  <p>34 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Riker's patience is just on the verge of running out.</p>
  <p> LORIN<br>
    We are already aware of your plan<br>
    to use Federation technology to<br>
    build new attack satellites. You<br>
    will find that we are prepared for<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    An interesting, if pointless lie.<br>
    I would rather discuss your own<br>
    plans to use Federation aid to<br>
    stage a takeover of Kolrod Island.</p>
  <p> LORIN<br>
    We have been over this before.<br>
    Kolrod clearly belongs to the<br>
    Prytt who originally--</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    That's it.</p>
  <p> They both fall silent and look at him in surprise.<br>
    Riker has decided to take charge here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I can see that... diplomacy is not<br>
    going to get us anywhere today,<br>
    and I don't have time for an<br>
    extended negotiation session. So<br>
    it's time to lay all the cards on<br>
    the table.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Attached&quot; - REV. 09/08/93 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Mauric and Lorin exchange a puzzled look -- card<br>
    playing must not be a Kes or Prytt activity.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That means it's time to stop<br>
    fooling around and get serious.<br>
    (to Lorin)<br>
    You're concerned that the Kes are<br>
    about to be admitted into an<br>
    associative membership with the<br>
    Federation.</p>
  <p> LORIN<br>
    Correct.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    As First Officer of the Enterprise<br>
    I think I can promise you that is<br>
    not going to happen. The Kes will<br>
    be denied membership.</p>
  <p> They both look at him in shock.</p>
  <p> MAURIC<br>
    You do not have the authority to<br>
    do that. Despite whatever games<br>
    you may have played with the Prytt<br>
    since your arrival, we still plan<br>
    on taking our petition directly to<br>
    the Federation Council. They will<br>
    listen to our--</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They will listen to the report of<br>
    the Enterprise Captain and his<br>
    First Officer. And I can tell you<br>
    right now that the First Officer's<br>
    report will go something like<br>
    this:<br>
    (he moves about the<br>
    room)<br>
    &quot;Kesprytt is a deeply troubled<br>
    world with social, political, and<br>
    military problems that it has yet<br>
    to resolve. The Kes, although a<br>
    friendly and democratic people,<br>
    are driven by suspicion,<br>
    deviousness, and paranoia. In the<br>
    opinion of this officer, they are<br>
    not ready for membership.&quot;</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Attached&quot; - REV. 09/08/93 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Mauric has definitely been put in his place. Riker now<br>
    notices that Lorin is looking pretty smug -- she seems<br>
    to have won.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Now to the matter of our missing<br>
    officers...</p>
  <p> LORIN<br>
    They are still charged with<br>
    spying, Commander. I have heard<br>
    nothing here which would alter<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then maybe you should consider<br>
    this: If anything happens to them,<br>
    Starfleet is going to want a full<br>
    investigation. That means more<br>
    starships will be sent to<br>
    Kesprytt... and those ships are<br>
    going to want answers... which<br>
    means they'll be putting your<br>
    country under a very large and<br>
    very uncomfortable microscope.</p>
  <p> Riker leans in close to Lorin... she doesn't like the<br>
    sound of any of this.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Remember how unhappy you were when<br>
    we contacted just one of your<br>
    people without authorization?<br>
    Well, think of what it'll be like<br>
    when ten starships start looking<br>
    for answers. They'll be<br>
    contacting hundreds of your<br>
    people... they'll conduct massive<br>
    sensor sweeps... they might even<br>
    start sending down Away Teams.<br>
    And all because you wouldn't help<br>
    me find my missing officers...</p>
  <p> Lorin is definitely starting to worry about this not so<br>
    bright future. Off her look of concern...</p>

  <p>35 EXT. BORDER AREA - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard and Beverly run toward the FORCEFIELD BORDER<br>
    between Prytt and Kes territory. The forcefield itself<br>
    is invisible unless touched, but the border is clearly<br>
    marked by signs and by large stanchions which operate<br>
    the forcefield.</p>
  <p> They stop just in front of the border. Beverly pulls<br>
    out her tricorder and begins working as Picard looks<br>
    behind them.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I think I can use the tricorder to<br>
    set-up a multiphase pulse. That<br>
    should weaken the field enough for<br>
    us to get through.</p>
  <p> She continues to work as Picard keeps an eye out. He<br>
    &quot;hears&quot; something and responds without turning around.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, no. The modulation frequency<br>
    should be in the upper-harmonic<br>
    range.</p>

  <p> Beverly reacts to something she &quot;hears&quot;.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm going as fast as I can.</p>
  <p> The distortion in the field gets LARGER. Picard and<br>
    Beverly get closer to the field. The following takes<br>
    place very quickly:</p>
  <p> -- The Troopers rush them... weapons drawn...</p>
  <p> -- The distortion in the field is almost the size of a<br>
    single person...</p>
  <p> -- Beverly glances over her shoulder and then makes a<br>
    lightening decision. She suddenly PUSHES him THROUGH<br>
    the distortion.</p>
  <p> -- Picard falls to the other side of the border.</p>
  <p> -- The distortion now writhes and fluctuates wildly<br>
    after his passage... Beverly can't get through.</p>
  <p> Picard jumps to his feet and looks back at Beverly in<br>
    horror as the Troopers rush up -- they've got her.<br>
    Picard and Beverly silently look at each other from<br>
    opposite sides of the border... unheard thoughts<br>
    rushing back and forth.</p>
  <p> The troopers keep their weapons trained on Beverly, but<br>
    they don't fire. One TROOPER activates his<br>
    communicator.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Attached&quot; - REV. 09/08/93 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROOPER<br>
    Minister, we have the human<br>
    female. The male is standing in<br>
    Kes territory.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>38 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Where Riker and Mauric listen as Lorin communicates<br>
    with the surface.</p>
  <p> LORIN<br>
    Very well. Transmit their<br>
    coordinates to the Enterprise<br>
    Transporter Room.</p>
  <p> TROOPER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Understood.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you, Minister. Now, if<br>
    you'll excuse me...</p>
  <p> Riker EXITS... leaving two very chastened people in the<br>
    Observation Lounge.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>39 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship in orbit.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Attached&quot; - REV. 09/08/93 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>40 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard, Beverly and Riker ENTER from the Transporter<br>
    Room walking down the corridor. Picard and Beverly are<br>
    still dirty and bedraggled from their adventure. Midconversation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mauric is determined to take his<br>
    protest to the Federation Council,<br>
    but I don't think he'll get very<br>
    far.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I tend to agree, Number One.</p>
  <p> They walk for a few beats, then Picard suddenly laughs<br>
    at something and turns to Beverly with a smile. She<br>
    looks at him for a moment and then she laughs too...<br>
    sharing some silent, private joke. Riker looks from<br>
    one to the other in puzzlement.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Did I miss something?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    I know... I know... you're<br>
    absolutely right.</p>
  <p> Picard and Beverly continue to trade telepathic<br>
    thoughts as they continue down the corridor, much to<br>
    Riker's confusion.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>41 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> It's much later. Picard and Beverly are just finishing<br>
    up the last remnants of an intimate dinner. They're<br>
    both in civilian clothes and the mood is warm,<br>
    inviting. Beverly pushes back her plate and looks very<br>
    contented. The implants are gone.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (re: food)<br>
    That was wonderful.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Attached&quot; - REV. 09/08/93 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My pleasure.</p>
  <p> Picard clears away the dishes and Beverly sits back in<br>
    her chair.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Don't take this the wrong way,<br>
    Jean-Luc... but I'm glad we're not<br>
    joined at the hip anymore.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Were you getting tired of my<br>
    company?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Just tired of bumping into you<br>
    every thirty seconds. I was<br>
    beginning to feel like you were<br>
    part of my uniform.</p>
  <p> Picard now produces a bottle of champagne.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Champagne... ?</p>
  <p> He pops the cork. Beverly smiles as he pours the<br>
    champagne.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (lifts her glass)<br>
    What shall we drink to?</p>
  <p> They look into each other's eyes for a moment. There<br>
    are many things they could drink to, but Picard opts<br>
    for something safe after an awkward beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Our... freedom.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Freedom.</p>
  <p> They clink glasses and sip the champagne. There is a<br>
    long quiet beat.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Penny for your thoughts.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was just thinking... that as<br>
    distracting as it was... I was<br>
    beginning to get used to...<br>
    &quot;hearing&quot; your thoughts.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Attached&quot; - REV. 09/08/93 - ACT FIVE 55A.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    So was I. It was very...<br>
    intimate.</p>
  <p> Picard nods and Beverly looks down into her glass.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You know... last night... I woke<br>
    up...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh?</p>
  <p> Beverly nods... she gives him a look full of sexual<br>
    innuendo.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I was awake for several hours.<br>
    And thanks to the implant, I got<br>
    to &quot;hear&quot; some very interesting<br>
    dreams of yours.</p>
  <p> Picard shifts for a moment... but he takes it with good<br>
    humor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A man can't be held responsible<br>
    for what his mind does when he's<br>
    asleep.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What about when he's awake?</p>
  <p> There is a long beat... Picard studies her for a<br>
    moment... then slowly gets up and moves closer to her.<br>
    After a moment, Beverly looks up at him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Attached&quot; - REV. 09/08/93 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> There is a crackle of attraction in the air... Picard<br>
    reaches out... she takes his hand... gets out of her<br>
    chair... and for one moment, they both realize that<br>
    anything is possible in this moment...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So now that we've had this...<br>
    unique experience... what do we do<br>
    now?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (innocent)<br>
    What do you mean?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You know exactly what I mean.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No I don't. The implant's been<br>
    removed, remember?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I mean now that we know how we<br>
    each feel... perhaps we shouldn't<br>
    be afraid to explore those<br>
    feelings...</p>
  <p> Beverly takes a long moment... looks at Picard, then<br>
    makes her decision.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (gently)<br>
    I'm not afraid... but I'm also not<br>
    ready.</p>
  <p> Picard nods silently. A moment... then she kisses him<br>
    on the cheek -- maybe just a little longer than<br>
    normal... and she heads for the door.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Good-night.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good-night.</p>
  <p> Beverly EXITS...</p>
  <p>42 INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Beverly ENTERS and stops just outside the door... looks<br>
    back... then walks off.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Attached&quot; - REV. 09/08/93 - ACT FIVE 56A.</p>
  <p>43 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Picard looks after her for a moment... then blows out<br>
    the candles.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
