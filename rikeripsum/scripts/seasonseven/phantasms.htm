    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> DATA is walking along, carrying a PADD. GEORDI catches<br>
    up to him from behind... out of breath, excited about<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data, there you are... we need to<br>
    install that plasma conduit right<br>
    away. We're bringing the new warp<br>
    core on-line in less than three<br>
    hours.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will go to deck twenty and begin<br>
    modifications.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Great. Meet me in Engineering as<br>
    soon as you're finished.<br>
    (excited)<br>
    This should be a lot of fun.</p>
  <p> As they head in different directions...</p>
  <p>2 INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Data walking along. Gradually, a RINGING SOUND is<br>
    heard echoing somewhere in the distance. Data tilts<br>
    his head in pain at the noise. The ringing is<br>
    intermittent, and sounds like an old-fashioned<br>
    telephone. A couple of rings go by. Data heads down<br>
    the corridor to find the sound...</p>
  <p>3 INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> As Data walks, the ringing gets louder. He sees<br>
    something ahead of him... and stops at what he sees --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Phantasms&quot; - 08/16/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>4 WIDEN TO INCLUDE</p>
  <p> a group of THREE WORKMEN. They are dressed in plain<br>
    gray coveralls, holding old-fashioned PICKS and<br>
    SHOVELS. They have removed a large section of the WALL --<br>
    visible within is a distinctive-looking WARP PLASMA<br>
    CONDUIT. They are hacking at the conduit with the<br>
    tools.</p>
  <p> Data reacts to the sight. Who are these people?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Excuse me. Do you have<br>
    authorization to work in this<br>
    area?</p>
  <p> The workmen ignore him. Data eyes the wall with<br>
    concern.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You are dismantling a warp plasma<br>
    conduit. I must ask you to stop.</p>
  <p> Again, no response. Data takes a step toward the<br>
    workmen and opens his mouth to speak -- but<br>
    inexplicably a HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEK comes out, piercing<br>
    and strange. Data is startled to hear it. He closes<br>
    his mouth.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the workmen turn as one and head right for<br>
    Data -- their expressions are cold and ominous.</p>
  <p> WORKMAN<br>
    Be quiet!</p>
  <p> One of the workmen GRABS Data's arm and TEARS THE ARM<br>
    FROM ITS SOCKET. Data reacts, stunned. He moves to<br>
    defend himself but the workmen converge on him and Data<br>
    falls to the ground. We hear the sound of RIPPING<br>
    CLOTHES and WRENCHING METAL as they start to tear Data<br>
    apart, limb from limb. We see an arm... a leg...<br>
    Data's head... shocking --</p>
  <p>5 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Data bolts awake in his bed, as if from a nightmare.<br>
    He glances around the room in momentary confusion...<br>
    then realizes it was a dream. OFF his startled<br>
    expression...</p>

  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>6 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is docked at a STARBASE.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 47225.7.<br>
    Commander La Forge has completed<br>
    the installation of our new warp<br>
    core. We are preparing to test<br>
    its capabilities.</p>
  <p>7 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> RIKER and various N.D.s at their stations. PICARD<br>
    ENTERS from his Ready Room, looking very grim-faced.<br>
    Riker takes note.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Something wrong, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I just got a message from<br>
    Starfleet command.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Bad news?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You could say that...</p>
  <p> Picard sits heavily.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I've been invited to the annual<br>
    Starfleet Admiral's banquet.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts somberly, knows what he's talking about.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    My condolences.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've managed to avoid it for the<br>
    last six years. I guess my luck<br>
    just ran out...<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Phantasms&quot; - REV. 08/25/93 - ACT ONE 4.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I can't imagine anything more<br>
    tedious. Fifty Admirals shaking<br>
    hands, making dull conversation...<br>
    uninteresting food... boring<br>
    speeches...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Can't you find an excuse not to<br>
    go?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    After six years, I don't have any<br>
    excuses left. Besides, I've been<br>
    invited by Admiral Nakamura, the<br>
    Sector Commander. He'd consider<br>
    it an insult if I turned him down.</p>
  <p> Riker considers a moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (with humor)<br>
    We could cause a diplomatic<br>
    crisis. Take the ship into the<br>
    neutral zone and attack the<br>
    Romulans... that should get you<br>
    out of the banquet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (wry)<br>
    I wouldn't count on it.</p>
  <p> OFF Picard's resigned expression...</p>
  <p>8 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Geordi and Data are working at the &quot;new&quot; warp core,<br>
    which looks slightly different than the old one: the<br>
    dilithium chamber drawer has a new and distinctive<br>
    design... and it is not active. (NOTE: This is a<br>
    redress of the existing warp core set.) A couple of<br>
    ENGINEERING N.D.s are working in the background.</p>
  <p> Geordi is looking at Data in surprise. Midconversation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Phantasms&quot; - REV. 08/19/93 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Have you ever had nightmares<br>
    before?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sure. Everybody does from time to<br>
    time...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have had one hundred eleven<br>
    dreams since I first discovered<br>
    the program nine months ago. In<br>
    all of that time, I have never<br>
    experienced such strange and<br>
    disturbing imagery in a dream.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I believe it was... a nightmare.</p>
  <p> Geordi keeps working.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Nightmares are part of dreaming,<br>
    Data. Maybe you just discovered<br>
    a new level to your program.</p>
  <p> Data considers this.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps. I have also noted that<br>
    I am spending an inordinate amount<br>
    of time thinking about nightmare<br>
    imagery. One could almost say<br>
    that I am... preoccupied.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, that's perfectly normal.<br>
    When I have a nightmare, sometimes<br>
    I can't shake that weird feeling<br>
    for days...</p>
  <p> Suddenly, a woman's voice interrupts from off camera --</p>
  <p> TYLER'S VOICE<br>
    Commander La Forge!</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Speaking of nightmares...</p>
  <p> A fresh-faced, young woman -- ENSIGN TYLER --<br>
    approaches Geordi. She looks like she just walked out<br>
    of the Academy. And she's clearly infatuated with<br>
    Geordi.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Phantasms&quot; - REV. 08/19/93 - ACT ONE 5A.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TYLER<br>
    (excited)<br>
    I just finished recalibrating the<br>
    starboard EPS module.</p>
  <p> Geordi forces a smile, tries to be polite.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Phantasms&quot; - REV. 08/17/93 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's great. Thank you, Ensign.</p>
  <p> TYLER<br>
    It's just like you said -- reset<br>
    the power tap... and the module<br>
    came right on-line. You have such<br>
    a wonderful grasp of engineering<br>
    principles. I'm learning so much<br>
    just by being around you...</p>
  <p> She smiles at him. An awkward moment.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well. Ah... why don't you go help<br>
    Farrel check the deuterium<br>
    cartridges. We're about to bring<br>
    the warp core on-line.</p>
  <p> TYLER<br>
    Anything you say.</p>
  <p> She gives him a big smile and walks off. Geordi's<br>
    smile fades away. Data gives him a puzzled look.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi, you do not seem to<br>
    appreciate Ensign Tyler's<br>
    enthusiasm.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Oh, she's enthusiastic all<br>
    right... about me.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not understand.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    She has a crush on me, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And you do not share her<br>
    affection?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Frankly, no. And it's getting a<br>
    little awkward...</p>
  <p> Data considers.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Phantasms&quot; - REV. 08/19/93 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe I understand. You are<br>
    concerned about unintentionally<br>
    hurting Ensign Tyler's feelings.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah... something like that...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It would appear that you require<br>
    a third party to intervene on your<br>
    behalf. I would be happy to speak<br>
    to her.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    No, Data... I'll take care of it<br>
    myself. Thanks.</p>
  <p> A moment as they work the console. Data still looks<br>
    preoccupied by his recent experience.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    When I first woke up from my<br>
    nightmare, there --</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Bridge to Commander La Forge.<br>
    What's our status?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (taps communicator)<br>
    We're ready to bring the core on-line,<br>
    Captain. Stand by.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    All right. Let's do it.</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi move to different consoles.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Initializing deuterium infusion<br>
    sequence...</p>
  <p> Geordi hits a command and the warp core COMES TO LIFE<br>
    with a different SOUND than we're used to hearing. The<br>
    light pulses are much faster than we've seen. Geordi<br>
    reacts to the sight, excited. This is an important<br>
    moment for him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re: core)<br>
    It's a beauty, isn't it? Now<br>
    let's see how fast she can run...<br>

    La Forge to Bridge. Warp power at<br>
    your discretion, Captain.</p>
  <p>9 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, N.D.s, as before. Picard and Riker on<br>
    their feet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Acknowledged.<br>
    (then)<br>
    Ensign Russell, plot a course to<br>
    Starbase Two-nineteen. Warp six.</p>
  <p> A beat. This is an exciting moment for all them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Engage.</p>
  <p>9A INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN</p>
  <p> The stars are static... indicating that the ship isn't<br>
    moving. A long beat goes by.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing, a little<br>
    louder)<br>
    Engage...</p>
  <p> The Ensign works but nothing happens.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing, to com)<br>
    Bridge to Engineering. Mister La<br>
    Forge... why isn't my ship moving?</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    I'm on it, sir. There's a warp<br>
    plasma conduit out of alignment,<br>
    but I think I've fixed it...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Ready, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. Ensign Russell?</p>
  <p> The Ensign works. Suddenly, there is the SOUND of<br>
    POWER DROPPING and ALL OF THE LIGHTS ON THE BRIDGE GO<br>
    OUT.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Phantasms&quot; - REV. 08/25/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>

    Mister La Forge?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Stand by, Captain...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will take the warp engines off-line.</p>
  <p> Data works and the warp core SHUTS DOWN. A moment<br>
    later, the normal LIGHTS COME UP in the room.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to com)<br>
    La Forge to Bridge. I'm sorry,<br>
    Captain. We're going to have to<br>
    reconfigure the plasma conduit.<br>
    It's going to take a few hours at<br>
    least, sir.</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Phantasms&quot; - REV. 08/16/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>13 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> A while later. Data is sitting quietly by his desk,<br>
    intently watching his cat SPOT, who is sleeping on the<br>
    desk top. The door chimes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Enter.</p>
  <p> TROI ENTERS. She is wearing her regulation Starfleet<br>
    uniform.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Hello, Data...</p>
  <p> She walks up to him, sees Spot.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What are you doing?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am watching Spot sleep. In the<br>
    past fifteen minutes, he has had<br>
    twelve muscles spasms, which<br>
    indicates that he is dreaming.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I have often wondered what he<br>
    dreams about. His twitching and<br>
    his rapid breathing would seem to<br>
    suggest anxiety -- but Spot has<br>
    never seen a mouse or any other<br>
    form of rodentia. Nor has he<br>
    encountered an insect, or been<br>
    chased by a canine.</p>
  <p> Data considers. They watch Spot for a moment.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I understand you've had some<br>
    interesting dreams lately...<br>
    (off his look)<br>
    Geordi was a little worried about<br>
    you. He just wanted me to check<br>
    in and see how you were doing...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Phantasms&quot; - REV. 08/17/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That was very thoughtful of him.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I have been debating whether or<br>
    not to initiate another dream<br>
    sequence.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Because of the nightmares... ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I have found them to be quite...<br>
    unsettling.</p>
  <p> Troi takes a seat next to him, speaks gently.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Data, you shouldn't be afraid to<br>
    experience dark imagery in your<br>
    dreams. It's a natural expression<br>
    of your unconscious...<br>
    (catches herself)<br>
    ... if you have an unconscious.<br>
    I'm not really sure how your<br>
    positronic brain works... but if<br>
    it's anything like our brains,<br>
    then there's part of you that's<br>
    trying to express itself through<br>
    your dream state. And I think you<br>
    should allow yourself to<br>
    experience it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    As Sigmund Freud would have<br>
    said... &quot;Dreams are the royal<br>
    road to the knowledge of the<br>
    mind.&quot;</p>
  <p> Data is intrigued by her words.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you, Counselor. I believe<br>
    I will initialize the dream<br>
    program now.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Let me know how it goes. Good<br>
    night, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Good night, Counselor.</p>
  <p> Troi EXITS. Data gives Spot a gentle pat.</p>

    (continuing)<br>
    Good night, Spot.</p>
  <p> Data stands and crosses to his bed. He takes a little<br>
    woolen NIGHT CAP off of a nearby table and places it on<br>
    his head.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Computer -- dim lights.</p>
  <p> The LIGHTS DIM. Data sits on the bed and fluffs his<br>
    pillow. He then very consciously stretches out his<br>
    arms and &quot;yawns&quot;. He lies down on the bed...</p>
  <p>14 CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE</p>
  <p> as he shuts his eyes. A long moment goes by as we PUSH<br>
    IN on his face... then...</p>
  <p>15 PULL BACK TO REVEAL:</p>
  <p>16 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> CLOSE ON DATA as he opens his eyes. He is now sitting<br>
    at a table in the room. There is an eerie and surreal<br>
    quality to the scene. WE ARE EXPERIENCING DATA'S<br>
    DREAM.</p>
  <p>17 INCLUDE WORF</p>
  <p> sitting opposite Data at the table. He is eyeing a<br>
    piece of CAKE that has a distinctive blue color similar<br>
    to that of a Starfleet science uniform. Sitting atop<br>
    the cake is a communicator pin, which Worf plucks off<br>
    and sets aside. He takes a bite of the cake.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Mmm. It is delicious.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What kind of cake are you eating?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (matter of fact)<br>
    It is cellular peptide cake...<br>
    with mint frosting. Would you<br>
    like a bite?</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    No, thank you.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the distinctive RINGING SOUND is heard<br>
    echoing somewhere in the room (as heard in the Teaser).<br>
    Data reacts in pain and touches his head.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Excuse me, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> Data stands and looks around the room, tries to locate<br>
    the source of the ringing sound (NOTE: the ringing<br>
    continues faintly throughout the scene). He starts<br>
    walking... sees something ahead of him... slows down<br>
    at the sight...</p>
  <p>18 INCLUDE RIKER AND BEVERLY</p>
  <p> sitting at the bar. BEVERLY is sipping from an opaque<br>
    STRAW that is sticking out of Riker's temple. She<br>
    seems to be enjoying the &quot;drink&quot;. Tiny slurping noises<br>
    can be heard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: ringing)<br>
    Aren't you going to answer that,<br>
    Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That damn ringing. Answer it,<br>
    will you?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes sir.</p>
  <p> FOLLOW Data as he walks across the room, trying to find<br>
    the ringing sound. It gets louder... he seems to be<br>
    getting closer...</p>
  <p>19 THE THREE WORKMEN</p>
  <p> (as seen in the Teaser) are huddled around a table,<br>
    engaged in some unseen activity. Data approaches them.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to workmen)<br>
    Please identify yourselves.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Phantasms&quot; - 08/16/93 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The workmen ignore him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I must know what you are trying to --</p>
  <p> Data's voice gives way to the high-pitched SHRIEK heard<br>
    earlier. Immediately, a workman turns and flashes him<br>
    a threatening look.</p>
  <p> WORKMAN<br>
    Be quiet!</p>
  <p> Data shuts his mouth. Another workman turns and hands<br>
    Data a large KNIFE -- an over-sized, exaggerated<br>
    version of a knife, dream-like. Data takes the knife,<br>
    unsure what to do with it.</p>
  <p> The workmen all step away from the table, parting to<br>
    reveal --</p>
  <p>20 TROI</p>
  <p> lying on her back on the table top. She is staring up<br>
    at Data with a frightened expression on her face. Her<br>
    legs are gone and HER TORSO IS A GIANT CAKE -- made to<br>
    look exactly like her real torso, blue uniform and all.<br>
    A piece has already been cut out of her chest where the<br>
    communication pin usually is.</p>
  <p> Data reacts to the sight.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Counselor...</p>
  <p> A workman gestures at Troi's right shoulder, as if to<br>
    say &quot;take a piece.&quot; Data eyes his knife.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (scared)<br>
    Data, please... don't hurt me..</p>
  <p> The workman shoves Data toward the table, insistent.<br>
    Data lifts the knife, drawn by the image of Troi...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am sorry, Counselor.</p>
  <p> Data jabs the knife into the cake at Troi's shoulder.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No...</p>

  <p> Data wakes up in his bed.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Data!</p>
  <p> Data sits up to see that Troi, Geordi and Worf are all<br>
    standing around him, staring at him with concern.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What is wrong?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We've been trying to wake you up<br>
    for the past five minutes.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    When you didn't show up in<br>
    Engineering on time, I got<br>
    worried... I called security...</p>
  <p> Data thinks a moment, reacts.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My internal chronometer was<br>
    supposed to wake me thirty-five<br>
    minutes ago.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You must have... overslept.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>22 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> A while later. Geordi and Data working.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I can't find anything wrong with<br>
    your internal time-base... and as<br>
    far as I can tell, your primary<br>
    systems check out fine.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My chronometer is functioning<br>
    normally, as well.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I will compare my autonomic logs<br>
    to the ship's chronometer.<br>
    Perhaps we overlooked something.</p>
  <p> Data moves to a console and starts working. Geordi<br>
    considers him for a moment.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You know, Data... there's a lot we<br>
    don't know about your dream<br>
    program. Maybe it was designed to<br>
    cause some side-effects...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    For all we know, Doctor Soong<br>
    intended for you to oversleep now<br>
    and then... as part of the human<br>
    experience.</p>
  <p> Data is intrigued by the idea.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is a possibility. However, I<br>
    would prefer to make certain there<br>
    are no anomalies in my neural net.</p>
  <p> Geordi nods. They work for a moment.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm curious... what were you<br>
    dreaming about when we woke you<br>
    up?</p>
  <p> Data thinks, recalling the dream... and he seems<br>
    distracted for a moment. It's clear that he doesn't<br>
    want to talk about it.</p>

  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have not fully assimilated its<br>

    the images further before<br>
    discussing them.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sure... I understand.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Sounds like it must've been pretty<br>
    strange...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    &quot;Strange&quot; is not a sufficient<br>
    adjective to describe the<br>
    experience.</p>
  <p> OFF Data's thoughtful expression...</p>
  <p>23 INT. HOLODECK/SIGMUND FREUD'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Early 1900's -- distinctly Viennese. SIGMUND FREUD is<br>
    sitting in a leather chair, holding a note pad. This<br>
    is Freud in his prime, with his trademark beard and<br>
    glasses. He speaks in a heavy German accent.</p>
  <p> FREUD<br>
    Tell me more about this... &quot;cake.&quot;</p>
  <p>24 MOVE TO REVEAL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data lying on an analyst's couch, staring up at the<br>
    ceiling.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is difficult to explain.<br>
    Counselor Troi's body was -- a<br>
    cake.</p>
  <p> Freud raises a bushy eyebrow, intrigued.</p>
  <p> FREUD<br>
    Her upper-body...<br>
    (scribbles a note)<br>
    Describe the knife you used to...<br>
    &quot;cut&quot; the Counselor.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It had a black handle and a<br>
    serrated blade. And it was quite<br>
    long.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Phantasms&quot; - 08/16/93 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Freud reacts.</p>
  <p> FREUD<br>
    How long?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Approximately twenty-five<br>
    centimeters in length.</p>
  <p> Freud nods and grunts, as if this has great meaning.</p>
  <p> FREUD<br>
    What happened next?</p>
  <p> Data remembers.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    One of the workmen pointed to her<br>
    right shoulder. At that moment,<br>
    I felt an overwhelming urge to cut<br>
    a piece out of the cake.</p>
  <p> FREUD<br>
    And did you... ?</p>
  <p> Data's face darkens slightly -- he's troubled by the<br>
    memory.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. As I began to slice the<br>
    cake, she reacted as though I was<br>
    causing her pain. And yet, I<br>
    could not stop cutting.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It was then that I woke up.</p>
  <p> FREUD<br>
    Mmm...</p>
  <p> Freud jots down another note.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am curious, Doctor Freud... what<br>
    do my nightmares mean?</p>
  <p> Freud takes a moment, then he sets down his note pad<br>
    and stands... moves to a nearby cigar box and takes<br>
    out a VERY LARGE CIGAR. He toys with it throughout the<br>
    scene.</p>
  <p> FREUD<br>
    I believe you are experiencing a<br>
    classic dismemberment dream.<br>

    Or in your case... being a<br>
    mechanical man... a dismantlement<br>
    dream.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not understand.</p>
  <p> As Freud explains, he moves about the room, quickly<br>
    rattling off his theories with great enthusiasm.</p>
  <p> FREUD<br>
    Your mechanistic qualities are<br>
    trying to reassert themselves over<br>
    your human tendencies. Ego and id<br>
    are struggling for domination.<br>
    The &quot;workmen&quot; symbolize the ever-present<br>
    id constantly working to<br>
    destroy the ego.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The image of Counselor Troi, a<br>
    female, is devoured by you...<br>
    clearly indicating an unconscious<br>
    desire to possess your own mother.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But I do not have a mother.</p>
  <p> FREUD<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    Do not interrupt. The knife and<br>
    its violent connotation suggests<br>
    a certain feeling of sexual<br>
    inadequacy...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have no sexual desires.</p>
  <p> FREUD<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    Ach! Repression on top of<br>
    everything. It is all becoming<br>
    clear to me now...<br>
    (thinks)<br>
    There might be a paper in this...<br>
    I could call it &quot;Mister D: An<br>
    Analysis of Android Dementia.&quot;</p>
  <p> Data stands up from the couch -- he's had enough.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not believe I am being helped<br>
    by this session.</p>

  <p>24 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Freud turns to Data, raising his voice.</p>
  <p> FREUD<br>
    Classic transference! Your anger<br>
    toward me is, in fact, the<br>
    animosity you feel toward your<br>
    father.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You are a polymorphously-perverse<br>
    individual, Mister Data, and I<br>

  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    Captain, we were expecting you<br>
    this morning. Is there a problem?</p>
  <p> Picard tries to make light of it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Actually, we've been experiencing<br>
    a few minor difficulties with our<br>
    new warp core. But my Chief<br>
    Engineer assures me that we'll be<br>
    under way within the hour.</p>
  <p> Nakamura nods, a little irritated.</p>
  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    I was hoping we'd have a chance to<br>
    discuss your new mission orders<br>

    the workmen were working on in the Teaser). Data and<br>
    Ensign Tyler are working nearby. The core still<br>
    RATTLES from time to time, and it's playing on Geordi's<br>

    If you'll excuse me, I need this<br>

  <p> She bends down and reaches her arms around Geordi as if<br>
    the physical closeness were nothing, and grabs a (TECH)<br>
    TOOL off the conduit. Geordi is uncomfortable with the<br>
    closeness. She smiles at him, then moves off. Data<br>
    gives Geordi a bemused look.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ensign Tyler still appears to have<br>
    a &quot;crush&quot; on you, Geordi. It is<br>

    I haven't had a chance, Data...<br>

    Here. Give me a hand with this<br>
    coil brace.</p>
  <p> Geordi and Data reach into the conduit and pull out a<br>
    long, thin piece of BRACING MATERIAL. The brace is<br>
    about a foot in length, with a few sharp protruding<br>
    edges -- like a ruler with a serrated edge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re: bracing)<br>
    Could you perform a metallurgical<br>
    scan on the brace... see if there<br>
    are any microfractures? Be<br>

  <p> Data nods and turns with the brace -- and stops,<br>
    staring down at the brace...</p>
  <p>34 CLOSE ON BRACE</p>
  <p> Data's hand is wrapped around it in exactly the same<br>
    way that he was holding the over-sized knife in his<br>
    dream. In fact, the metal and shape of the brace is<br>
    very suggestive of the knife.</p>
  <p>35 DATA</p>
  <p> stares at the image, disturbed by the memories it<br>
    conjures. Geordi glances at him.</p>

    heard from somewhere in the room. Data turns at the<br>
    noise --</p>
  <p>38 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Data turns -- everyone in the room is gone. Data is<br>
    alone, and the room is completely silent, except for<br>

  <p> RIKER'S VOICE<br>
    Aren't you going to answer that,<br>
    Commander?</p>
  <p>39 RIKER</p>

    stomach in irritation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What are you waiting for? Answer<br>
    it!</p>
  <p> Data glances down at his stomach... then he slowly<br>

  <p> Visible inside his stomach is an old-fashioned<br>
    TELEPHONE RECEIVER -- and it's ringing. Data pulls out<br>

    phone&quot;.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (into phone)<br>
    Hello?</p>
  <p> FREUD'S VOICE is heard on the other end --</p>
  <p> FREUD'S VOICE<br>
    Kill them. You must kill them<br>
    all... before it's too late.</p>
  <p> Data reacts to the words. Suddenly, a HAND grabs Data<br>
    from behind --</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S VOICE<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> Data turns --</p>
  <p>41 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Data turns -- Geordi and Ensign Tyler are standing<br>
    nearby, staring at him in concern. Geordi has just<br>
    taken Data by the arm. Everything is back to normal.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data, what's wrong?</p>
  <p> Data is shocked, confused.</p>

  <p> ACT THREE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>42 INT. TROI'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Data is holding the coil brace seen earlier, and he's<br>
    contemplating it with a serious look. He's on his<br>
    feet, pacing the room, determined to understand his<br>
    recent experiences.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Everything seems to remind me of<br>
    the nightmare -- objects, sounds,<br>
    smells. And now I have seen<br>
    elements from the dream while<br>
    still in a waking state.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I cannot explain it.</p>
  <p> Troi tries to comfort him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Data... if you were one of my<br>
    human patients, I might be<br>
    concerned right now. I'd say you<br>
    had a waking dream... or a<br>
    hallucination...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But you're not human. It seems to<br>
    me that we might be looking at<br>
    some sort of technological<br>
    problem...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have run three complete self-diagnostics.<br>
    All of my systems<br>
    are functioning normally.</p>
  <p> Troi considers this. Data paces a moment... looking<br>
    for explanation...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I have studied over one hundred<br>
    thirty-eight different theories of<br>
    dream analysis in an effort to<br>
    explain my nightmares.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What have you found?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Phantasms&quot; - REV. 08/16/93 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have been unable to find a<br>
    single interpretation of my<br>
    nightmares. For instance, Neo-Platonic<br>
    hermetic texts from the<br>
    Ancient Near East would suggest<br>
    that my experience indicates a<br>
    prophetic function -- that I have<br>
    perceived an impending disaster.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Professor Syrus of Tilonus Four<br>
    would consider my dreams nothing<br>
    more than epi-phenomena in my<br>
    neural net. Random discharges<br>
    with no meaning whatsoever.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Doctor Freud of early Twentieth<br>
    century Earth suggested that my<br>
    dreams represent a latent psychosexual<br>
    complex.</p>
  <p> Data stares down at the (TECH) brace.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Perhaps Freud was correct... and<br>
    the knife I dreamed of is the<br>
    embodiment of my unconscious<br>
    desire to inflict violence.</p>
  <p> Troi reacts to this.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Data... even Freud said &quot;sometimes<br>
    a cigar is just a cigar.&quot;<br>
    (beat)<br>
    A lot of the theories you've<br>
    examined are interesting... but<br>
    they're also flawed and obsolete.</p>
  <p> Troi stands and moves to him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That knife could just as well be<br>
    an archetypal symbol of rational<br>
    clarity -- it's sharp... it cuts<br>
    through things that are dull...</p>
  <p> Data looks at her, starting to hear the sense in her<br>
    words.</p>

  <p>42 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The bottom line is... I think you<br>
    may be developing an almost...<br>
    obsessive interest in your own<br>
    inner-workings.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'd almost call it the beginnings<br>
    of a... neurosis.</p>
  <p> Data reacts.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is not possible.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why not? You've eliminated all<br>
    the technical explanations. And<br>
    it makes sense that as your neural<br>
    net becomes more complex... more<br>
    human... you might experience the<br>
    same kind of psychological<br>
    complexities as a human.</p>
  <p> Data is excited by the possibility.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (hopeful)<br>
    Do you really think it is<br>
    possible?</p>
  <p> Troi smiles.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You may be the first person who's<br>
    come into my office who's actually<br>
    been excited by the prospect of a<br>
    new neurosis.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But yes... I do think it's<br>
    possible. In fact, I'd like to<br>
    start counseling you on a regular<br>
    basis.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    No... we'll start weekly. And as<br>
    a first step, I want you to shut<br>
    down your dream program until our<br>
    next session... just to be safe.<br>
    Give yourself a chance to reflect<br>
    on this experience.</p>
  <p> Data nods.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you, Counselor. I look<br>

    Unfortunately, the problem has<br>
    affected our impulse systems now.<br>

    Yes, sir. And for a reason I<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    What about me? Did you see one of<br>

    He's not here... try to relax.</p>
  <p> Beverly examines the medical device.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The vascular pad has healed your<br>
    wound. But you've lost a lot of<br>
    blood... so I want you to lie<br>
    still for a while.</p>
  <p> Troi nods. Beverly removes the medical device from<br>
    Troi's shoulder... and reacts with surprise to what<br>
    she sees. Visible on Troi's skin is a strange, mottled<br>
    red DISCOLORATION.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That's odd... there shouldn't be<br>
    any discoloration after the<br>
    treatment. This looks like some<br>
    sort of rash...</p>
  <p> Beverly picks up a medical tricorder and scans Troi's<br>
    shoulder.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    I'm picking up cellular<br>
    degradation. But I don't think<br>
    it's related to the lacerations...<br>
    (scans)<br>
    And there's some kind of residual<br>
    interphasic signature...</p>
  <p> Troi looks worried. Beverly thinks a moment.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Nurse)<br>
    Nurse, get me an interphasic<br>
    scanner... I want to take a<br>
    closer look.</p>
  <p> The Nurse nods and heads off. Beverly gingerly touches<br>
    the discolored area with her finger.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Does that hurt?</p>

  <p>63 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Data and Worf ENTER. The two Guards can be seen<br>
    outside in the corridor.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will have to confiscate your<br>
    sidearm.</p>
  <p> Data moves to his desk reaches underneath -- pulls out<br>
    his phaser and hands it to Worf.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    May I ask a personal favor?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes?</p>
  <p> Data walks over to the couch, where Spot is lying down.<br>
    He indicates the cat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Will you take care of Spot for me?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Your... animal?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I am concerned that if I have<br>
    another waking dream, I may...<br>
    injure him.</p>
  <p> Worf is moved by the sentiment.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> Worf eyes the cat, not quite sure how to deal with it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Spot. Come here.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Unlike a canine, Spot will not<br>
    respond to verbal commands.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Phantasms&quot; - 08/16/93 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data gently picks up Spot and hands him to Worf. Worf<br>
    handles the cat awkwardly. Data reaches out and pets<br>
    Spot on the head gently.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Goodbye, Spot.</p>
  <p> Worf heads for the door.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    He will need to be fed once a day.<br>
    He prefers feline supplement one-twenty-five.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I understand.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And he will require water. And<br>
    you must also provide him with a<br>
    sand box.</p>
  <p> Worf nods.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing, one last<br>
    thing)<br>
    And you must talk to him. Tell<br>
    him he is a pretty cat, and a good<br>
    cat...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (cutting him off)<br>
    I will... feed him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps that will be enough.</p>
  <p> Worf EXITS. OFF Data's face... thoughtful, and very<br>
    troubled by what has happened...</p>
  <p>64 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Beverly is standing next to Troi, who is still lying on<br>
    the surgical table, semi-conscious. Picard and Riker<br>
    ENTER. Beverly turns to them, urgent.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain. We have a problem. Take<br>
    a look at this...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Phantasms&quot; - REV. 08/17/93 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>64 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Beverly points to the discoloration on Troi's shoulder,<br>
    which has gotten noticeably worse -- the red mottling<br>
    has spread.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing, re: rash)<br>
    Her tissue is breaking down on a<br>
    cellular level... and it's<br>
    spreading. At first I thought it<br>
    was a rash from the coil brace she<br>
    was stabbed with... but when I<br>
    used the interphasic scanner, I<br>
    found something else...</p>
  <p> Beverly picks up an INTERPHASIC SCANNER and activates<br>
    it -- the scanner sends out a BLUE LIGHT. She shines<br>
    it onto Troi's shoulder...</p>
  <p>65 ANGLE ON TROI'S SHOULDER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As the light hits Troi's skin, it ILLUMINATES a<br>
    previously unseen CREATURE. The creature is large and<br>
    leech-like in appearance, frightening -- and it is<br>
    gripping Troi's skin with several thin tendrils.</p>
  <p>66 RESUME (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As Beverly takes the light away. Reactions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The better question is... what are<br>
    they?</p>
  <p> Beverly shines the light on her own forearm. We now<br>
    see a SIMILAR CREATURE latched onto her arm. She takes<br>
    the light away.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've only checked the medical<br>
    staff... but I've found them on<br>
    almost everyone so far...</p>

  <p>66 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Beverly moves to Riker, shines the blue light over his<br>
    chest... his arms... then over his face... and<br>
    discovers a CREATURE hugging the side of his face at<br>
    the temple. Beverly shines the light over Picard --<br>
    revealing a CREATURE clamped onto his neck... and<br>
    another one gripping his chest.</p>
  <p> OFF their shocked reactions...</p>

  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>67 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Worf, Geordi and Beverly, middiscussion.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The infestation rate has reached<br>
    seventy-three percent of the crew<br>
    so far. The cellular decay is<br>
    accelerating in all cases. I<br>
    haven't found a way to stop it...<br>
    or even slow it down.</p>
  <p> Riker unconsciously touches the side of his face, where<br>
    we saw the creature earlier. He knows it's there, and<br>
    it gives him the creeps.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What are we dealing with here?<br>
    Are these creatures... feeding off<br>
    us?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    In a way... They appear to be<br>
    extracting our cellular peptides.<br>
    It's roughly analogous to the way<br>
    Terran leeches consume hemoglobin.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can we reverse the process?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not until the organisms are<br>
    removed. And if they're not<br>
    removed soon, our bodies will<br>
    begin to lose all cellular<br>
    cohesion... we'll collapse into<br>
    nothing but a few pounds of<br>
    chemicals.</p>
  <p> Reactions to the grim image.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can we affect the organisms in any<br>
    way?</p>

  <p>67 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We've tried E-M radiation...<br>
    subspace fields... thermal<br>
    protons... nothing works. They<br>
    seem to exist in an interphasic<br>
    state, just beyond our visual and<br>
    sensor acuity. The only way we<br>
    can see them is to use an IP<br>
    scanner... tricorders can't even<br>
    pick them up.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do we know where these things came<br>
    from?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have scanned the vicinity with<br>
    an IP scanner. There is no sign<br>
    of any similar creatures, or any<br>
    unusual interphasic activity.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps Starbase Eighty-four...<br>
    could we have picked them up there<br>
    during the installation of the<br>
    warp core?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I contacted the Starbase and had<br>
    them use IP scanners. Nothing.</p>
  <p> Picard thinks for a long beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What about Mister Data? There<br>
    must be some connection between<br>
    his odd behavior and these<br>
    creatures. Is he infested, as<br>
    well?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No. I scanned him, but I didn't<br>
    find anything.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data attacked Counselor Troi<br>
    because he said he saw a...<br>
    &quot;mouth&quot; on her shoulder...<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    And in that same area, you first<br>
    discovered one of the organisms...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Phantasms&quot; - REV. 08/16/93 - ACT FIVE 47.</p>
  <p>67 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (onto idea)<br>
    He also saw a &quot;straw&quot; on the side<br>
    of my head... and Beverly found an<br>
    organism in the same spot.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (thinks)<br>
    Those were all images from his<br>
    dreams... maybe he's unconsciously<br>
    perceiving these creatures...</p>
  <p> Picard considers... makes the decision.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think it's time we took a closer<br>
    look at Mister Data's dreams.</p>
  <p>68 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Picard and Geordi talking to Data, mid-scene.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is an interesting hypothesis.<br>
    If I am being affected by these<br>
    interphasic creatures on an<br>
    unconscious level, it may also<br>
    explain my waking dreams, and my<br>
    subsequent anti-social behavior.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What we want to do is link your<br>
    neural net into the Holodeck...<br>
    and have you activate your dream<br>
    program, so as you're dreaming...<br>
    we can observe the dream images.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Phantasms&quot; - REV. 08/16/93 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p>68 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps we can learn more about<br>
    the creatures by interpreting the<br>
    symbols and images in your dreams.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (onto the idea)<br>
    I see. The concept is similar to<br>
    the method of Directed Dreaming.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Exactly.<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    How soon can you have the link<br>
    ready?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We'd need about an hour to<br>
    establish all the interface<br>
    parameters.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    In the meantime, Mister Data...<br>
    I'd say you should prepare for<br>
    bed.</p>
  <p> OFF Data's face...</p>

  <p> as before.</p>
  <p>70 INT. HOLODECK GRID (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard is standing inside the ARCH on the empty<br>
    Holodeck GRID. Data is sitting on a chair -- his head<br>
    is OPEN and a couple of high-tech CABLES connect his<br>
    circuitry to a panel on the arch. Geordi is making<br>
    adjustments to Data's circuits. Two Security Guards<br>
    stand nearby.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I think we're ready, Captain...<br>
    the link is active, and the<br>
    Holodeck has been calibrated to<br>
    Data's neural net.</p>
  <p> Geordi completes his work and stands.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a breath.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Normally, I would wish you<br>
    pleasant dreams... but in this<br>
    case, bad dreams would be more<br>
    helpful.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I understand.<br>

    I am initializing my dream<br>

    Keep your eyes peeled. Even an<br>
    apparently insignificant image<br>
    could be an important symbol.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Right...</p>
  <p> After a beat, Data comes quickly walking around a<br>
    corner. He sees them.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Hello.</p>
  <p> He walks on by. Picard and Geordi follow him down the<br>
    hall.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can we talk to Data directly... or<br>
    will that wake him up?</p>

  <p>71 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    He should be perceiving us as just<br>
    another part of his dream.<br>
    Anything we say to him will be<br>
    taken in that context...</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the familiar RINGING SOUND begins. Data<br>
    stops and reacts the sound in pain.</p>

  <p> With determination, Data continues walking... and EXITS<br>
    into Ten Forward. Picard and Geordi follow...</p>
  <p>72 INT. TEN FORWARD - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> We see the same setting and group of people as seen in<br>
    the dream in Act One (the workmen are not present).<br>
    Data, Picard and Geordi ENTER. The ringing sound has<br>
    stopped. Data looks around the room, then walks over<br>
    to a table where the &quot;Troi cake&quot; is lying on the table.<br>
    There are several pieces missing, and Troi is now<br>
    unconscious. Worf sits nearby, eating a piece of the<br>
    cake. Data picks up the large knife seen earlier and<br>
    begins to cut a slice out of her right shoulder.</p>
  <p> Picard and Geordi react to the bizarre sight. Data<br>
    offers Picard a piece of cake.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Cake?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Picard takes the cake. Data starts to cut another<br>

    They're both symbols of...<br>

    Be quiet!</p>
  <p> One of them pulls out an old-fashioned GERMAN LUGER and<br>

    Go away. Leave us alone.</p>

    (to workmen)<br>
    Who are you?</p>
  <p> One of the workman turns toward Picard.</p>
  <p> WORKMAN<br>
    We are... your enemies.</p>
  <p> The workmen suddenly turn as a group and GRAB Picard<br>
    and Geordi. Picard and Geordi struggle, but it's no<br>
    use. The three workmen raise their picks, preparing to<br>
    STAB Geordi and Picard...</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    (to workmen)<br>
    Stop. You are hurting my friends<br>
    and I must --</p>
  <p> Data's voice gives way to the high-pitched SHRIEK heard<br>
    earlier. Immediately, the workmen let go of Picard and<br>
    Geordi and converge on Data, angry.</p>
  <p> WORKMAN<br>
    Be quiet!</p>
  <p> Data leaps up from the couch... backs away from the<br>
    workmen... suspense building as they raise their picks<br>
    and shovels, getting closer...</p>
  <p> Picard watches the workmen... starting to realize...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (quickly, to Data)<br>
    Data, the shrieking noise you made --<br>
    it causes them pain!</p>
  <p> Data glances at Picard, then opens his mouth and emits<br>
    the high-pitched SHRIEK. The workmen stop and react in<br>
    pain.</p>
  <p> WORKMAN<br>
    Be... quiet!</p>
  <p> The workmen try to move toward Data, but the shriek is<br>
    too painful. They stumble backward in response to it.<br>
    Data takes a step toward them, mouth open, emitting the<br>
    shriek. One workman drops his tools and slumps against<br>
    the wall, helpless. The other two drop their tools and<br>
    fall to their knees. A moment later, they all slump to<br>
    the floor, unconscious.</p>
  <p> Data closes his mouth. The shrieking stops. A look of<br>
    realization crosses his face.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe I understand.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, everything VANISHES --</p>

  <p>74 INT. HOLODECK GRID</p>
  <p> Picard and Geordi in the same positions. They look<br>
    toward Data, who is still attached to the arch. Data<br>
    opens his eyes and looks at them.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (urgent, to Geordi)<br>
    Geordi, you must adjust my<br>
    positronic subprocessor to emit an<br>
    interphasic pulse.</p>
  <p> Geordi nods and quickly kneels beside Data, starts to<br>
    make adjustments to the circuitry on his head.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, what's going on?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (explains)<br>
    The workmen in my dreams represent<br>
    the organisms which are trying to<br>
    demolish the ship. The incessant<br>
    ringing of the telephone, and<br>
    Freud's cautions at the other end,<br>
    were warnings of the dangers<br>
    around us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What about the shrieking noise you<br>
    made?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Phantasms&quot; - REV. 08/19/93 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>74 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My positronic subprocessors were<br>
    detecting high-frequency<br>
    interphasic signatures from the<br>
    organisms... which were<br>
    symbolically represented in my<br>
    dreams by the high shriek.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    When you made those sounds, the<br>
    workmen reacted in pain...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is why I have asked Geordi to<br>
    adjust my subprocessor. If I can<br>
    produce a high-frequency<br>
    interphasic pulse, it may have a<br>
    similar effect on the creatures.</p>
  <p> Geordi completes his adjustments.</p>

  <p> Picard nods to Geordi, who then hits a circuit on<br>
    Data's head. We hear a HIGH-PITCHED WHINE (similar to<br>
    the SHRIEK in dream). The whine gets higher and<br>
    higher, more intense... finally going up and out of the<br>
    range of human hearing...</p>

    see the creature hugging her skin. After a moment, the<br>
    creature DISINTEGRATES -- gone.</p>
  <p> Beverly then shines the light on her own arm -- no sign<br>
    of any creature.</p>

  <p> Geordi is showing Picard the warp plasma conduit seen<br>
    earlier. Ensign Tyler works nearby.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re: conduit)<br>
    This conduit was manufactured on<br>
    Thanatos Seven using a new<br>
    interphasic fusion process. We<br>
    think that process must've<br>
    attracted the organisms to the<br>
    conduit... where they lay<br>
    dormant... until we activated the<br>
    warp core.<br>

    That's also why we couldn't get<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long until we have warp power<br>
    again?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We'll have to manufacture a new<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Thanks. You've been doing a great<br>
    job. We've got to work on toning<br>
    down your enthusiasm a little...<br>
