    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it travels at impulse.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 47254.1.<br>
    A delegation of the Cairn have<br>
    just come on board. This<br>
    telepathic species has no concept<br>
    of spoken language, and is being<br>
    instructed in its use by... an<br>
    old friend.</p>
  <p>2 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> The SENIOR STAFF is holding a reception for the Cairn.<br>
    They are tallish humanoids, intelligent looking -- with<br>
    small protrusions on the sides of their heads that<br>
    suggest increased cranial capacity.</p>
  <p> PICK UP PICARD and LWAXANA TROI in mid-conversation.<br>
    Lwaxana is wearing an outfit that is unusually subdued<br>
    for her.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    I don't know what they'd have done<br>
    without me. First, I had to learn<br>
    how they communicate. It was an<br>
    absolutely exhausting process...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It must have been.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Quite different from Betazoid<br>
    telepathy. We transmit words...<br>
    with the Cairn...<br>
    (shakes her head at the<br>
    enormity of it)<br>
    ... it's images. A flood of them,<br>
    all at the same time. It's<br>
    overwhelming...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can imagine...</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    It's actually a very efficient way<br>
    of communicating. If two Cairn<br>
    were having this conversation it<br>
    would have been over minutes ago.</p>
  <p> This gets Picard's attention.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Really?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    But of course they realize they'll<br>
    want to communicate verbally if<br>
    they join the Federation.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Do me a favor... introduce<br>
    yourself to one of them and engage<br>
    him in conversation -- they need<br>
    the practice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'd be happy to.</p>
  <p> He moves off and Lwaxana looks around, spots --</p>
  <p>2A GEORDI AND DATA</p>
  <p> who are talking with a light-haired Cairn girl of about<br>
    eight, HEDRIL.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    ... it's called a VISOR. It lets<br>
    me see things.</p>
  <p> When Hedril speaks, her voice has a slight ELECTRONIC<br>
    EDGE to it -- as do all the Cairn's voices.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - REV. 08/27/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> HEDRIL<br>
    Like my vocal enhancer.<br>
    (touches her throat)<br>
    It lets me make sounds.</p>
  <p> At this point Mrs. Troi swoops down on them.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    I see you've met my star pupil.<br>
    (puts her arm around<br>
    Hedril)<br>
    Hedril has picked up spoken<br>
    language much faster than the<br>
    others.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is often the case that children<br>
    learn languages more easily than<br>
    adults.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Deanna was quite good at languages<br>
    when she was little.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Where is Deanna?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (looking around)<br>
    Should be here someplace...</p>
  <p> Mrs. Troi bends down to Hedril.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Hedril, darling...</p>
  <p> She stops, staring at Hedril with a curious expression.<br>
    Hedril waits patiently, then --</p>
  <p> HEDRIL<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> Mrs. Troi comes out of her reverie.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Go find your father, dear. I want<br>
    to talk to him.</p>
  <p> Hedril darts off and Mrs. Troi puts her face in her<br>
    hand for a moment. Data and Geordi are concerned.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Mrs. Troi, are you all right?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - TEASER 3A.</p>
  <p>2A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> She looks up at them, a little vague.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Yes... yes... just a little tired.<br>
    This constant telepathy with the<br>
    Cairn...<br>
    (summoning a smile)<br>
    I'm fine, really.</p>
  <p> She gives them a reassuring smile and moves off toward<br>
    Riker and Worf, who are standing alone, chatting.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Aren't you going to mingle, Mister<br>
    Woof?</p>
  <p> Worf has given up on correcting her.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I do not care for telepaths. They<br>
    make me... uneasy.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Don't worry -- The Cairn couldn't<br>
    read your thoughts even if they<br>
    wanted to. Your brain isn't<br>
    sophisticated enough.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts and Riker can't help but smile.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (continuing, to Riker)<br>
    Neither is yours, dear. They can<br>
    only communicate with other<br>
    telepaths.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Has either of you seen Deanna?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (looking around)<br>
    She was working, but she said<br>
    she'd be here -- ah -- speak of<br>
    the devil.</p>
  <p> Troi walks up to them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - TEASER 4-5.</p>
  <p>2A CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Sorry I'm late. I lost track of<br>
    the time.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Deanna, dear, come with me. I<br>
    want you to meet the senior<br>
    diplomat of the Cairn delegation.</p>
  <p> She sees Hedril leading a Cairn man, MAQUES, toward<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Maques...<br>
    (re Troi)<br>
    This is the beautiful daughter<br>
    I've been telling you about --<br>
    Deanna.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>2A CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Maques smiles... a nice smile, sincere.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    Pleased to...</p>
  <p> He stops, can't remember the rest of the greeting.<br>
    With a self-deprecating smile he decides to try<br>
    another, simpler one.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    Hello.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Hello.</p>
  <p> Troi helps him out by finishing for him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Pleased to meet you.</p>
  <p> He smiles.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    Yes, that is it. Pleased to meet<br>
    you, Deanna.</p>
  <p> They share a smile. Lwaxana seems pleased.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Well, I'll just let you young<br>
    people chat...</p>
  <p> She moves away with Hedril, Deanna giving her a brief<br>
    look. Then, making the most of it...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Well, Maques... what do you think<br>
    of the Enterprise?</p>
  <p> There is a brief hesitation as Maques struggles for<br>
    words -- still a very difficult concept for him.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    It is... --<br>
    (he thinks)<br>
    -- beautiful... comfortable, also.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm glad you think so.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>2A CONTINUED: (7)</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    There is another word... a word<br>
    that describes it... but... I<br>
    cannot remember.</p>
  <p> He gives a small shrug, and Troi smiles encouragingly.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You've learned a great deal in a<br>
    very short time. I'm sure it<br>
    won't be long before your words<br>
    will do justice to your thoughts.</p>
  <p> Maques acknowledges, then --</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    Your Mother has... told me... of<br>
    your need.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Need?</p>
  <p> He can't remember the word, holds up a finger to ask<br>
    for a moment.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    A moment...<br>
    (remembers)<br>
    Husband. You need a husband.</p>
  <p> Troi's face blanches.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I need a wife.</p>
  <p> He smiles matter-of-factly. Troi looks over his<br>
    shoulder and sees her mother watching them hopefully.<br>
    As Troi glares at her we...</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>3 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Troi, now in uniform, is heading for her office.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (O.C.)<br>
    Deanna!</p>
  <p> Troi turns and sees her Mother, waits for her to catch<br>
    up.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Good morning...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    So what did you think of Maques?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why did you do that, Mother? You<br>
    embarrassed both of us.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (dismissing this)<br>
    He's really very sweet. And<br>
    lonely. Poor man, a widower,<br>
    raising a child alone.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Please, Mother... don't start.</p>
  <p> They reach a Turbolift door.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    I just think it's time for you to<br>
    settle down. If your Father were<br>
    still alive I'm sure he'd say the<br>
    same thing.</p>
  <p> The door OPENS and they join an N.D Crewperson inside.</p>
  <p>4 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> They fall silent in front of the crewperson. After a<br>
    moment, Lwaxana continues TELEPATHICALLY.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - REV. 08/27/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (V.O.)<br>
    But you'll do exactly what you<br>
    want...</p>
  <p> Troi shoots her a look.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Just like always...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Stop it, mother.</p>
  <p> The Crewperson reacts to Troi's seemingly out-of-the-blue<br>
    statement. Troi realizes and falls silent. After<br>
    an awkward moment, the lift stops and the DOOR opens.<br>
    Troi EXITS but her mother just stays where she is,<br>
    looking despondent.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Are you coming?</p>
  <p> But Lwaxana covers her face with her hands as if to<br>
    hide tears. Troi's face registers concern; she takes<br>
    her mother by the arm and leads her out of the<br>
    turbolift.</p>
  <p>5 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> The Turbolift door closes and Troi puts a comforting<br>
    hand to her mother's shoulder.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What's wrong... ?</p>
  <p> Lwaxana looks at her, her eyes intent with feeling.<br>
    Suddenly she clutches Troi to her, hugs her tight.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    You're so precious to me. You're<br>
    all I've got. If something<br>
    happened to you I don't know what<br>
    I'd do...</p>
  <p> Troi doesn't know what to make of her mother's abrupt<br>
    mood swing, but she does know that right now what she<br>
    needs is to be comforted.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Nothing's going to happen to me...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Troi's comforting words help Lwaxana pull herself<br>
    together.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    You'd better go...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    My first appointment isn't for a<br>
    few minutes... why don't we talk<br>
    for a while?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    I'm fine... I'm just tired from<br>
    working with the Cairn and it's<br>
    making me emotional.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Are you sure?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Go on... I'll see you later...</p>
  <p> Troi hesitates. Lwaxana manages a smile.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (continuing, shooing her<br>
    away)<br>
    Go on.</p>
  <p> She moves off down the corridor. Troi watches for a<br>
    beat, then heads for her office.</p>
  <p>6 INT. TROI'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> As Troi ENTERS. To her surprise, Maques is waiting for<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Maques...</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    I wanted to... apologize... for<br>
    yesterday.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You don't have to --</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    My words... they were... confused.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It wasn't your fault. My mother<br>
    misled you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - REV. 08/27/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    Not in everything... she has an<br>
    image of you... in her mind --<br>
    (gestures to his temple)<br>
    -- she shared it with me...</p>
  <p> Troi nods that she understands.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    (continuing, smiles)<br>
    You are even more beautiful...</p>
  <p> Troi accepts the compliment with a smile. Maques leans<br>
    forward, concentrates on choosing his words.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The way my people communicate...<br>
    It is... direct. Nothing is<br>
    hidden.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    Your Mother is... the first... to<br>
    learn our telepathy...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You mean you've never had<br>
    telepathy with someone who wasn't<br>
    Cairn?</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> He struggles to articulate his thoughts.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    To communicate with her is... very<br>
    different.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    In what way?</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    Always... there is a part of<br>
    her... a part of her that is...<br>
    dark.</p>
  <p> Troi is unsure what he means by this.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Dark?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Maques seems frustrated by his inability to make<br>
    himself clear.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    A part of her that... can not be<br>
    seen. Do you understand?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm not sure...<br>
    (she considers)<br>
    Did you ask my Mother about this?</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    She called it... a moment...<br>
    (remembering the word)<br>
    Privacy.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (realizing)<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> Troi thinks how to put this.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You said that among the Cairn,<br>
    nothing is hidden. We value<br>
    honesty, but we don't always share<br>
    everything we're thinking and<br>
    feeling.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    This is... privacy?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    It is... normal?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    For us, yes.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    If this is your way... I am...<br>
    relieved.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    It is our way.</p>
  <p> He smiles at her and stands.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - ACT ONE 12A.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    I will leave now.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm glad you stopped by.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    I am glad to have stopped also.</p>
  <p> He bows slightly and EXITS. Troi feels better about<br>
    the incident with Maques, but what just happened with<br>
    her mother is still very much on her mind.</p>

  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it moves at impulse.</p>
  <p>8 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Troi and Riker are sitting at a table. The usual<br>
    compliment of N.D.'s, including TWO N.D. Cairn.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I was all set for another round of<br>
    arguing when all of a sudden she<br>
    just... fell apart.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    She's been under a lot of stress,<br>
    preparing the Cairn to meet with<br>
    the Federation Council.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's more than that. I've been<br>
    sensing very... erratic emotions<br>
    from her. Even the clothes she's<br>
    wearing seem unusual -- very<br>
    subdued.</p>
  <p> He sees she's worried, takes her hand.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe you better have a talk with<br>
    her --</p>
  <p> LWAXANA (O.C.)<br>
    Commander --</p>
  <p>9 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Including Mrs. Troi, who stands behind them. Her face<br>
    is intense and her eyes bore in to Riker.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Take your hands off her.</p>
  <p> Her words carry a barely controlled anger. Riker is<br>
    stunned. He pulls back from Troi.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mrs. Troi --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Don't &quot;Mrs. Troi&quot; me.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother!</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Why don't you leave her alone? If<br>
    it weren't for you she'd be<br>
    married by now.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (standing)<br>
    That's enough.</p>
  <p> A few heads turn their way.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    I'm warning you, stay away from<br>
    her!</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're coming with me --</p>
  <p> Troi takes her firmly by the arm and starts to lead her<br>
    away -- everyone in the room can't help but look. Off<br>
    Riker's face...</p>
  <p>10 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Where Troi watches as BEVERLY examines Lwaxana, who is<br>
    calm now and full of regret.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    I don't know what got into me.<br>
    Please tell Wil how sorry I am.</p>
  <p> Troi indicates that she will. Beverly finishes a scan<br>
    and turns to Troi.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    She's fine, except her psilosynine<br>
    levels are a little low.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Psilosynine?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's a neurotransimitter<br>
    involved in telepathy.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's been depleted by your work<br>
    with the Cairn. You're going to<br>
    have to avoid telepathic<br>
    communication for a while.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    I can't -- We only have three days<br>
    left and the Cairn still have so<br>
    much to learn.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm sorry, but you're going to<br>
    have to take some time and rest.</p>
  <p> Lwaxana is about to continue her objections when Troi<br>
    offers:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Maybe I can help with the Cairn.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    You're only half-Betazoid, dear.<br>
    And you don't have any experience<br>
    with their form of telepathy.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Then I won't use telepathy; we'll<br>
    work verbally.</p>
  <p> Lwaxana considers this for a beat.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    I suppose we could do that...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And if they don't understand<br>
    something I'll explain it to them<br>
    telepathically.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, you'll work verbally too. The<br>
    point is for you to rest.<br>
    Besides, it'll be good for them to<br>
    have to figure things out with<br>
    words.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Well... I suppose you're right.</p>
  <p> Troi smiles, pleased that her mother has agreed...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>11 INT. ARBORETUM</p>
  <p> A thicket with trees, shrubs and flowers. Nearby is a<br>
    small POND. A couple of N.D Crew Children are playing<br>
    near the pond.</p>
  <p> Troi ENTERS leading Maques, Hedril, and TWO N.D. Cairn.<br>
    Lwaxana trails behind -- she seems more calm and<br>
    relaxed.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    This is the ship's arboretum.</p>
  <p> HEDRIL<br>
    Arbor means tree.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Very good, Hedril. People like to<br>
    come here to relax, enjoy<br>
    themselves in a natural setting.</p>
  <p> Maques inspects a nearby ROSE BUSH, reaches to touch it<br>
    and is pricked by a thorn. He looks at his thumb, then<br>
    back at the rose -- perplexed.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    &quot;Flowers of all hue, and without<br>
    thorn the rose... &quot;</p>
  <p> The Cairn look at her, curious what she might mean.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That's from an old earth poem by<br>
    John Milton.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    Please... what is a... poem?</p>
  <p> Troi realizes they have no idea.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Poetry is... an art-form that uses<br>
    words, put together in new and<br>
    unexpected ways -- sometimes in<br>
    rhyme.</p>
  <p> Maques nods as if he understands. Encouraged, Troi<br>
    continues:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - ACT ONE 17.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Milton was speculating that in<br>
    Heaven, roses wouldn't have<br>
    thorns.</p>
  <p> The Cairn look at her, unsure.</p>
  <p> HEDRIL<br>
    Heaven... ?</p>
  <p> Troi realizes she's just getting in deeper.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Heaven is... it's a...</p>
  <p> She can't quite figure out how to phrase this. Before<br>
    she can continue, Lwaxana catches Maques' eye and<br>
    transmits a telepathic message.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    I see. Yes, thank you. &quot;Heaven.&quot;</p>
  <p> Troi realizes what happened and turns toward her<br>
    mother.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother, you're supposed to be<br>
    avoiding telepathy.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    I was just trying to help, dear.</p>
  <p> But Lwaxana now looks drawn, tired.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You don't look well.</p>
  <p> Lwaxana glances at a nearby BENCH.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    I'm just tired -- maybe I'll sit<br>
    down...</p>
  <p> Troi decides not to make too much of this, and Lwaxana<br>
    goes and sits on the bench (during this Hedril slips<br>
    away to play with the other children).</p>
  <p> Troi turns back to the Cairn, who watch with some<br>
    concern.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Don't worry... she'll be fine...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - ACT ONE 18.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Everyone relaxes -- their eyes turn to the pond, where<br>
    Hedril is now playing. Suddenly she slips and falls<br>
    into the pond.</p>
  <p> Since it's only inches deep there's no harm done --<br>
    she's just wet. She gets up and keeps playing as if<br>
    nothing happened, and Maques just smiles and shakes his<br>
    head.</p>
  <p> Suddenly one of the Cairn reacts to something behind<br>
    Troi. Troi turns and sees that her mother is lying on<br>
    the ground next to the bench, seemingly unconscious.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother!</p>
  <p> She rushes to her, tries to wake her --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Mother... ?</p>
  <p> When Lwaxana doesn't answer, Troi activates her<br>
    combadge.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>12 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Lwaxana lies unconscious on a Sickbay bed, Picard and<br>
    Troi stand off to the side. Beverly is removing the<br>
    CORTICAL STIMULATOR PADS from Lwaxana's forehead. She<br>
    seems stumped, but tries to break her news to Troi<br>
    gently.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    She's not responding to cortical<br>
    stimulation. I'm not sure what<br>
    more I can do...</p>
  <p> Troi takes this hard.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't understand... she was fine<br>
    just yesterday.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've never seen anything like<br>
    this. It's almost as if her brain<br>
    has... shut itself down.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there any physiological cause?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm running a sub-neural scan, but<br>
    as far as I can see there's no<br>
    tissue damage, no neuro-chemical<br>
    imbalance, no sign of infection --<br>
    nothing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yet her neural activity is<br>
    practically non-existent.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The only exception is in the<br>
    paracortex -- activity there is<br>
    almost off the scale.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The paracortex is the Betazoid<br>
    telepathic lobe.<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    She communicated with Maques<br>
    telepathically just before she<br>
    fell...</p>

    Might there be some side-effect of<br>
    Cairn telepathy that we're not<br>
    aware of?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's a possibility.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    I think you and I had better have<br>
    a talk with Maques.</p>
  <p> Troi acknowledges, and with a last glance toward her<br>
    mother's still form, she and Picard EXIT.</p>
  <p>13 INT. MAQUES' QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Troi and Picard are talking with Maques.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    I am very...<br>
    (searches for word)<br>
    apologetic -- for what has<br>
    happened to your Mother.</p>
  <p> Troi acknowledges his sentiment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Maques, is it possible that your<br>
    telepathic communications with<br>
    Mrs. Troi harmed her in some way?</p>
  <p> Maques reacts -- struggles to find the words with which<br>
    to respond.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    No... I tried to... to explain...<br>
    before.</p>
  <p> He looks at Troi to see if she understands -- sees that<br>
    she doesn't. It's frustrating for him, he can't<br>
    express his complex thoughts.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Bad thoughts... they hurt her...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What thoughts, Maques? Take your<br>
    time...</p>

  <p> MAQUES<br>
    Inside her... the dark place...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't understand.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    She is... what are the words... I<br>
    don't have the words...</p>
  <p> Maques looks at Troi, locks his eyes onto hers.<br>
    Suddenly a great, swirling WHITE NOISE can be heard --<br>
    Troi covers her ears as if to block out the sound, but<br>
    it only grows louder.</p>
  <p> Picard, who seems not to hear anything, reacts to what<br>
    looks like an attack on Troi by Maques.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counsellor --</p>
  <p> Her eyes are locked on Maques' -- it's as if she's<br>
    unable to look away.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing, to Maques)<br>
    Stop it!</p>
  <p> Picard steps toward him -- suddenly the noise STOPS.</p>

    It's all right, Captain.</p>
  <p> Troi tries to clear her head.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm fine... He was just trying to<br>
    communicate with me<br>
    telepathically.</p>
  <p> Maques looks at her hopefully.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    Do you understand now?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I... I'm not sure...</p>
  <p> But her face tells us that he's told her something<br>
    important.</p>

  <p>14 INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Beverly, Troi and Picard.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He communicated so much to me that<br>
    at first it was just a jumble of<br>
    images.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Have you been able to sort any of<br>
    it out?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I think so... during his<br>
    telepathic contact with my Mother,<br>
    Maques sensed what he calls a<br>
    &quot;dark place.&quot;</p>
  <p> Picard and Beverly register curiosity.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He tried to tell me about it<br>
    before, in my office. I<br>
    misunderstood, I thought he was<br>
    talking about thoughts she was<br>
    keeping private. What he meant<br>
    was that something was happening<br>
    in her meta-conscious mind.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Meta-conscious?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's a part of the Betazoid<br>
    psyche. A kind of... filtering<br>
    mechanism to protect us from<br>
    psychic trauma.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is Maques suggesting that<br>
    Lwaxana's meta-conscious is<br>
    damaged somehow?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - REV. 08/26/93 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He feels that whatever is wrong<br>
    with her is centered there. If<br>
    he's right... that may mean that<br>
    she's suffered some kind of trauma<br>
    that her meta-conscious can't<br>
    tolerate.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Did your Mother mention anything<br>
    that happened to her lately,<br>
    something that might have been<br>
    traumatic for her?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No. Nothing like that.</p>
  <p> They seem to have come to a dead-end.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Maques could be wrong about this.<br>
    There's still a chance that the<br>
    sub-neural scan will pinpoint an<br>
    physiological cause for your<br>
    Mother's condition, something I'll<br>
    be able to treat.</p>
  <p> Troi looks at her, hopeful.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The results won't be in until<br>
    morning; maybe we should all get<br>
    some rest.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

    I'd like to stay here with her...<br>
    I'm going to try to contact her<br>
    telepathically.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    All right.</p>

    DIMMED for sleep, and Lwaxana is now in a hospital<br>
    gown.</p>
  <p> Troi pulls up a stool and sits next to her mother. She<br>
    looks down at her still features for a long moment.<br>
    She takes her hand, and then we hear her speak<br>
    TELEPATHICALLY.</p>
  <p> TROI (V.O.)<br>
    Mother... can you hear me... ?</p>

    door to Sickbay opening... footsteps approaching.</p>
  <p> A FIGURE approaches Lwaxana's bed, stands over her,<br>
    looking down. We hear the rush of WHITE NOISE that<br>

  <p>18 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Troi, and Beverly are trying to find out what<br>
    Maques was doing in Sickbay. He's a little rattled by<br>
    what happened and it's affecting his speaking ability.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What were you doing in Sickbay,<br>
    Maques?</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    Helping... trying to help<br>
    Lwaxana...</p>
  <p> Troi clearly believes him, wants to know more.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How... what were you trying to do?</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    I was... she is...</p>
  <p> But he can't find the words. He suddenly gets very<br>
    agitated, as if he's come to a realization but can't<br>
    express it.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You, Deanna. Maybe you --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't understand.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    You must... how can I explain...</p>
  <p> His frustration mounts. Troi leans toward him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Tell me, telepathically.</p>
  <p> Maques and Troi lock eyes... after a moment we hear the<br>
    rush of WHITE NOISE. Troi is better prepared this<br>
    time, and is less affected. It's over in just a<br>
    moment, and Troi turns to Picard -- ready to explain<br>
    what Maques has told her.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Maques believes my Mother's psyche<br>
    has... collapsed in on itself --<br>
    that for some reason, she's<br>
    retreated into her meta-conscious<br>
    mind.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Was he trying to contact her<br>
    telepathically?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes. He was able to access images<br>
    being generated by her meta-conscious<br>
    mind. But he couldn't<br>
    make any sense of them...</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    I did not... understand...</p>

    He saw faces he didn't recognize,<br>
    events he couldn't interpret.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If we could decipher those images,<br>
    it might help us determine whether<br>

    a... telepathic &quot;bridge&quot; that<br>
    will allow me to access her meta-conscious.<br>
    If he can, I might be<br>
    able to find out what happened to<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you succeed, would you be able<br>
    to use that information to help<br>
    your Mother?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm not sure. But I do know that<br>
    some part of her wants to be<br>
    helped. When I tried to contact<br>
    her telepathically, I heard a<br>
    voice calling out to me.</p>
  <p> Picard takes this in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If her psyche has... &quot;collapsed in<br>
    on itself,&quot; could accessing her<br>
    mind pose any danger to you?</p>
  <p> Troi doesn't want to have to admit it:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There's no way to know.</p>

  <p>18 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't like the sound of this.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Sir, I'd like to try...</p>
  <p> Picard studies Troi's face for a moment... then decides<br>
    to go ahead and let her try.</p>
  <p>19 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Picard watches as Beverly and a NURSE set up for Troi's<br>
    attempt to contact her mother. Troi lies on a bed next<br>
    to her mother's, and Maques stands between them. Biomonitors<br>
    are ON LINE for both Lwaxana and Troi.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I'll be monitoring her through the<br>
    whole procedure. If anything goes<br>
    wrong, Maques can break the<br>
    telepathic link.</p>
  <p> Beverly steps away, nods to Maques.</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Your Mother -- part of her is...<br>
    very frightened. She may...<br>
    resist you.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I understand.</p>
  <p> Maques looks at Lwaxana for a long moment -- the WHITE<br>
    NOISE can be heard, far off, faint.</p>
  <p> He then turns and looks into Troi's eyes. The WHITE<br>
    NOISE intensifies.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>20 TROI'S POV</p>
  <p> Looking up at Maques -- his eyes locked on hers.</p>
  <p>21 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> as Maques stands between Troi and Lwaxana. The WHITE<br>
    NOISE grows in volume until it becomes hard to take.</p>
  <p> Suddenly it stops and we simultaneously cut to:</p>
  <p>22 INT. AN ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> where Troi finds herself standing alone. But the<br>
    corridor looks nothing like we're used to seeing --<br>
    it's dark, the perspective is strange... surreal -- as<br>
    if we're looking at it through a distorted lens.</p>
  <p> We hear the SOUND of water dripping... ECHOING as the<br>
    drops land. Troi scans the corridor trying to locate<br>
    the source of the sound... but it seems to come from<br>
    everywhere.</p>
  <p> Suddenly we hear a WOLF'S GROWL -- dangerous,<br>
    menacing... Troi has to fight off her fear, takes a<br>
    moment to calm herself.</p>
  <p> Her resolve is strengthened when she suddenly hears the<br>
    VOICE she heard before, coming from behind her.</p>
  <p> VOICE<br>
    Help me...</p>
  <p> She whips around to see if anyone's there... nothing.<br>
    She's not sure if it was her mother's voice or someone<br>
    else's...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (unsure)<br>
    Mother... ?</p>
  <p> She hears the VOICE again, coming from the other<br>
    direction.</p>
  <p> VOICE<br>
    Help me...</p>
  <p> She turns and this time sees a SHADOW disappear around<br>
    the corner.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - REV. 08/27/93 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She moves toward it, rounds the corner... but no one is<br>
    there. She starts down the corridor, which is darker<br>
    than the last. The SOUND of dripping water echoes<br>
    louder as she makes her way down it.</p>
  <p> Then, very faint, she hears Picard's VOICE, coming from<br>
    nowhere specific.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Counselor... can you hear me... ?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (unsure)<br>
    Captain... ?</p>
  <p> Picard comes around the corner in front of her. His<br>
    manner is calm and he wears a gentle smile.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Deanna... Doctor Crusher is<br>
    concerned that your para-cortical<br>
    readings have become erratic.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Are you... talking to me from<br>
    Sickbay?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. I want you to sever your<br>
    connection to your Mother.</p>
  <p> Troi remembers what Maques said -- that everything she<br>
    encountered would be part of her mother's mind.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why don't you ask Maques to do it?</p>
  <p> Picard smiles.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm asking you.</p>
  <p> Troi reacts -- that's not an answer. Picard is<br>
    suddenly much firmer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That's an order, Counselor.</p>
  <p> Troi regards him evenly.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're not Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> Picard looks into her eyes -- when he speaks, it is in<br>
    LWAXANA'S VOICE, a voice filled with pain.</p>
  <p> PICARD/LWAXANA<br>
    Leave me alone... please...</p>
  <p> Troi takes a breath, then moves past him and continues<br>
    down the corridor, determined to find her Mother... the<br>
    WOLF GROWLS again... ominous.</p>
  <p> As she makes her way down the corridor the dripping<br>
    SOUND grows LOUDER.</p>
  <p>23<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    24</p>
  <p>25 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> revealing that a large WOLF is blocking her path. It<br>
    looks at her with piercing eyes, its intentions<br>
    unreadable... Troi is determined to get past it.</p>
  <p> She takes a cautious step forward, but the Wolf lets<br>
    out a warning growl.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to herself)<br>
    This isn't real... none of this is<br>
    real...</p>
  <p> But the sound of her voice only provokes the creature.<br>
    Its growl becomes more menacing, and it suddenly lunges<br>
    at her...</p>
  <p> Troi turns and runs... and the Wolf comes after her --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - ACT THREE 31A.</p>
  <p>26 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Troi runs down the corridor, the Wolf just a few<br>
    yards behind her, vicious and intent... She rounds a<br>
    corner and ENTERS the nearest door, which closes behind<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>27 INT. TROI'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Troi's face registers recognition and astonishment when<br>
    she sees a dark-haired man, her FATHER. He's about<br>
    thirty-five and wears an old-style Starfleet uniform<br>
    with Lieutenant's pips.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Daddy... ?</p>
  <p> He smiles warmly, opens his arms to her.</p>
  <p> MISTER TROI<br>
    Deanna...</p>
  <p> Overwhelmed by the emotion of seeing him, she starts to<br>
    move into his arms... but she stops... refusing to give<br>
    in to what she knows isn't real.</p>
  <p> The room around her is a strange combination of Troi's<br>
    Enterprise quarters and a home on Betazed. Instead of<br>
    her personal belongings, the room is set up for a child --<br>
    there's a DOLL HOUSE, some other more HIGH-TECH TOYS.</p>
  <p> It is beautiful and calm, in sharp contrast to the<br>
    nightmarish nature of the corridors. Instead of stars,<br>
    a VIEW OF A BETAZED LANDSCAPE can be seen through the<br>
    windows.</p>
  <p> MISTER TROI<br>
    Look at you... you've become a<br>
    beautiful woman...</p>
  <p> This is a heartbreaking event for Troi. Her beloved<br>
    father, taken from her at such a young age, whom she<br>
    has missed so much... but he's not real.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Don't do this...</p>
  <p> MISTER TROI<br>
    I'm sorry I had to go away when<br>
    you were so little... I didn't<br>
    want to...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're not my father... you're a<br>
    part of Mother's mind...</p>
  <p> Mister Troi smiles gently, neither denying nor<br>
    admitting to what she's saying.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - REV. 08/27/93 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Troi looks around her, at the room, the beautiful view.<br>
    She's looking for some clue as to what it all might<br>
    mean.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What is this place?</p>
  <p> MISTER TROI<br>
    It's our house near Lake El'nar,<br>
    on Betazed. We used to live here.<br>
    Deanna -- let's not waste this<br>
    chance. I want to hear everything<br>
    that's happened to you...</p>
  <p> But Troi is wandering the room, looking at the toys.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Did I live here?</p>
  <p> MISTER TROI<br>
    For a while... when you were a<br>
    baby. You were such a beautiful<br>
    baby... Your mother and I loved<br>
    you so much...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't remember these toys...</p>
  <p> MISTER TROI<br>
    I'll bet you don't remember me<br>
    singing you to sleep at night,<br>
    either... but I did.</p>
  <p> Troi turns to him, unexpectedly moved.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I do remember... I always felt<br>
    safe when you sang to me...</p>
  <p> He smiles. He's full of warmth, and love. It's<br>
    irresistible.</p>
  <p> MISTER TROI<br>
    There was one song you always<br>
    asked me to sing... you couldn't<br>
    fall asleep unless you heard<br>
    it....</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - REV. 08/27/93 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Troi is caught in the moment. Tears sting at her eyes.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (a whisper)<br>
    Down in the valley...</p>
  <p> MISTER TROI<br>
    (singing very softly)<br>
    Valley so low... hang your head<br>
    over.... hear the wind blow --</p>
  <p> Troi wills herself away from the seductive moment.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No... no... you're trying to keep<br>
    me here... keep me from finding<br>
    something...</p>
  <p> MISTER TROI<br>
    (sadly)<br>
    Your Mother doesn't want to see<br>
    you, Deanna.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I have to help her...</p>
  <p> MISTER TROI<br>
    If you want to help her... leave.<br>
    Let her have peace.</p>
  <p> She begins backing toward the door.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But... she called out to me....<br>
    she does want my help.</p>
  <p> Her father extends his arms to her, gentle, persuasive.</p>
  <p> MISTER TROI<br>
    Stay with me... just a little<br>
    while... it's been so long --<br>
    we'll never have this chance<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> Troi knows this is true... and it's anguishing. It<br>
    takes all her will to keep from going to him, feeling<br>
    his strength and his protection, letting him salve all<br>
    her concerns. But those feelings are the trap, and she<br>
    must not give in to them. With difficulty, knowing<br>
    she'll never see him again --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Goodbye, daddy.</p>
  <p> She turns and EXITS, leaving him behind, sadness in his<br>
    eyes.</p>
  <p>28 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> As she returns to the dark and surreal part of her<br>
    mother's mind. The dripping SOUND resumes. Troi looks<br>
    around, unsure which way to go. She decides to return<br>
    in the direction she came.</p>
  <p> She approaches the intersection of the two corridors,<br>
    rounds a corner.</p>
  <p>29 ANGLE - TROI</p>
  <p> as she stops in her tracks, shocked by something she<br>
    sees.</p>
  <p>30 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Revealing what she sees -- it is Hedril, standing some<br>
    five yards down the corridor, looking at her with huge,<br>
    accusing eyes. Strangely, she doesn't look Cairn --<br>
    whatever the anatomical differences are between us and<br>
    them are not evident -- she has the dark eyes of a<br>
    Betazoid.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Hedril... ?</p>
  <p> Suddenly Mrs. Troi steps out into the corridor. Her<br>
    face is tense.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Mother...</p>
  <p> Troi is about to take a step toward her, but her mother<br>
    suddenly cries out in pain and anger.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Get away from here!</p>
  <p> She rushes threateningly toward Troi --</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>32 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Beverly, Data and Troi are talking with Maques<br>
    and Hedril. The little girl seems a little afraid<br>
    about having to face these strangers, and Troi tries to<br>
    put her at ease.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I asked your Father to bring you<br>
    here because I wanted to talk to<br>
    you about something.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You know that Lwaxana is sick,<br>
    don't you?</p>
  <p> HEDRIL<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> She looks scared and worried.</p>
  <p> HEDRIL<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Is it my fault?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No... not at all. But... I<br>
    believe my Mother has been<br>
    thinking about you. Do you know<br>
    why?</p>
  <p> HEDRIL<br>
    I make her sad.</p>
  <p> Troi reacts.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why do you say that?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - REV. 08/27/93 - ACT FOUR 38.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> HEDRIL<br>
    Because it's true.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to Maques)<br>
    Do you have any idea why Hedril<br>
    would make my Mother sad?</p>
  <p> MAQUES<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Troi smiles at Hedril to let her know she's done well.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Thank you for coming to talk to<br>
    us. I'll see you later, all<br>
    right?</p>
  <p> She gestures to Maques that he can take her away. As<br>
    they reach the door, Hedril stops and turns around.</p>
  <p> HEDRIL<br>
    I hope your mother gets better.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Thank you, Hedril. So do I.</p>
  <p> Maques and Hedril EXIT.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I just don't understand how she<br>
    fits in to all this...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I still haven't been able to find<br>
    a physiological cause for what's<br>
    happened to your Mother. That<br>
    makes me think that Maques was<br>
    right, that her condition was<br>
    precipitated by some traumatic<br>
    event.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Could this event have involved<br>
    Hedril?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't think so. My Mother never<br>
    mentioned her.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Does your mother make personal<br>
    logs... or keep a journal?</p>

  <p>32 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes, she does. I'll contact<br>
    Mister Homn on Betazed and ask him<br>
    to transmit a copy as soon as<br>
    possible. Maybe there's a clue<br>
    there...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps we are being too literal.<br>
    In my recent study of dream<br>
    analysis, I learned that people<br>
    who appear in a dream can<br>
    sometimes represent different<br>
    aspects of the person who is<br>
    dreaming.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's right... a child might<br>
    represent vulnerability. Maybe<br>
    Hedril depicts some fragile part<br>
    of my mother.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A part that she's protecting...<br>
    (explaining)<br>
    ... you said everything you<br>
    encountered when you were in her<br>
    mind was a barrier of one kind or<br>
    another...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes... you, the wolf, my father...<br>
    as though she were summoning all<br>
    her defenses to keep me away.</p>
  <p> Troi looks around the room, frustrated and overwhelmed<br>
    by her inability to put together all the parts of this<br>
    puzzle.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

    protecting?</p>

  <p>34 INT. TROI'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Troi has her mother's VALISE on a table and is going<br>
    through her things. It is a difficult thing to have to<br>
    do, and her face shows it.</p>
  <p> She picks up a few objects... a piece of jewelry,<br>
    flamboyant as only Lwaxana can be... a small carved<br>
    figure of uncertain origin... and then, in the bottom,<br>
    a small round box. Deanna lifts it, opens it, and sees --</p>
  <p>34A INSERT - THE BOX</p>
  <p> Inside lies a small curl of dark hair, tied with a bit<br>
    of ribbon.</p>
  <p>34B BACK TO SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Troi smiles at this memento of herself and closes the<br>
    box. Then she uncovers a photograph... it's Mister<br>

  <p> Troi accepts this grim news.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Have you had any luck here?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, nothing. I've gone through<br>
    her belongings... and read her<br>
    journal from the last five<br>
    years...<br>
    (a bit wry)<br>
    ... and other than the fact that<br>
    I'm not married yet, nothing bad<br>
    seems to have happened to her.</p>

    He had a kind face...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

    I remember when he died, my Mother<br>

    I didn't understand that he wasn't<br>

    trauma, there's just no evidence<br>
    of it.</p>
  <p> Picard glances at the computer screen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You said you'd reviewed her<br>
    journals for the past five years.<br>
    Perhaps we should go further back.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There's a lot to review. My<br>
    mother's kept a journal since she<br>
    was first married...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, let's start at the<br>
    beginning.</p>
  <p> He sits at the computer, which shows a series of file<br>
    numbers and dates. He works the controls.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The first entry seems to be<br>
    Stardate 30620.1.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's the year they were married.</p>
  <p> Picard fiddles at the controls some more, a puzzled<br>
    expression coming over him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is odd... there's a seven<br>
    year gap.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - ACT FOUR 42-42A </p>
  <p>34B CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Troi considers the dates.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It starts about a year after my<br>
    parents were married...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And if I'm not mistaken, it ends<br>
    a few months after your birth.</p>
  <p> Troi acknowledges he's right. As Picard continues to<br>
    work the console:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    My Mother has always been so<br>
    diligent about her journal -- why<br>
    would she have stopped making<br>
    entries for so long?</p>
  <p> Picard reacts to something he's found.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    She didn't. The files were<br>
    deleted.</p>
  <p> Troi reacts.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    By your Mother... almost thirty<br>
    years ago.</p>
  <p> Troi considers what this might mean.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't understand any of this...</p>
  <p> She rises, faces Picard with resolve.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Captain, I have to go back in to<br>
    my mother's mind. That's the only<br>
    way we're ever going to get any<br>
    answers.</p>
  <p> Off Picard's reaction we...</p>

  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>35 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Troi is lying on the bed next to her mother's. Maques<br>
    and Beverly are preparing for her to go back into<br>
    Lwaxana's mind. Picard stands next to Deanna.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Deanna... you understand that if<br>
    your para-cortical readings go too<br>
    high again, I'll have to tell<br>
    Maques to sever the connection.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I know.</p>
  <p> She turns and nods to Maques. He stands between Troi<br>
    and Lwaxana, establishes the telepathic link as before.<br>
    The rush of WHITE NOISE builds to a crescendo and<br>
    suddenly stops.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>36 INT. AN ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> dark and ominous as before. From behind her, Troi<br>
    HEARS the menacing growl of the Wolf.</p>
  <p> She turns at the sound and is astonished to see Hedril<br>
    standing just feet away from the animal, whose fangs<br>
    are bared at Troi. Hedril stares at her -- her<br>
    Betazoid eyes unsettling, intense.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Hedril, be careful...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - ACT FIVE 44.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> But Hedril reaches and strokes the animal as if it were<br>
    a pet. When she speaks, her voice does not have the<br>
    distinctive mechanical edge that the Cairn normally<br>
    have.</p>
  <p> HEDRIL<br>
    Who is Hedril?</p>
  <p> With that she and the Wolf turn and run off down the<br>
    corridor.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Wait! I want to talk to you --</p>
  <p> But &quot;Hedril&quot; and the Wolf continue away. Troi hurries<br>
    after them -- the Wolf bounds ahead, but the advantage<br>
    of size lets Troi catch up with Hedril. She's almost<br>
    within reach of Hedril's fleeing form when the girl<br>
    rounds a corner... a split second later Troi rounds the<br>
    same corner and is stunned to see that the corridor is<br>
    gone; there is nothing before her but the starry<br>
    blackness of SPACE.</p>
  <p> Troi stops short... Hedril seems to have disappeared<br>
    into the void. Troi doesn't know what to do. Then,<br>
    from somewhere in the starscape before her, she hears<br>
    the VOICE that has been calling to her.</p>
  <p> VOICE<br>
    Help me...</p>
  <p> Troi decides she must move on. Steeling herself<br>
    against her natural fears, she jumps into the<br>
    nothingness...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>37 INT. ARBORETUM - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> as Troi finds herself standing near the pond. She<br>
    looks around, puzzled to find herself here. It isn't<br>
    the pleasant environment we saw earlier -- it's dark,<br>
    spooky. The dripping SOUND continues its eerie echo...</p>
  <p> Troi listens and realizes that the pond is the source<br>
    of the dripping sounds.</p>
  <p> She looks around for some sign of where Hedril has<br>
    gone, but there's nothing. Then, from somewhere near<br>
    the pond, she HEARS the voice again.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Dark Page&quot; - 08/26/93 - ACT FIVE 45.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> VOICE<br>
    Help me...</p>
  <p> She moves toward the pond, comes to its edge. She<br>
    looks down at its placid surface but sees nothing in<br>
    the murky water...</p>
  <p>38 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Before Troi's astonished eyes a reflection takes<br>
    shape... but it's not her face... it's Hedril's.</p>
  <p> Troi leans closer, tries to read the little girl's<br>
    expression, but a STONE SPLASHES into the water and its<br>
    RIPPLES obscure the image.</p>
  <p> Troi turns to see who has thrown the rock -- but all<br>
    she catches is a glimpse of a FIGURE disappearing<br>
    behind some foliage. Troi steels herself and follows.</p>
  <p>39 ANOTHER PART OF THE ARBORETUM</p>
  <p> Troi comes upon Lwaxana, standing staring out into the<br>
    distance, as if guarding this place and its secrets.<br>
    Her face is filled with sadness.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (gently)<br>
    Mother... ?</p>
  <p> Lwaxana turns and sees her.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Go away.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No... I want to help you.</p>
  <p> Mrs. Troi shakes her head sadly, as if this were<br>
    impossible. But Troi presses on, confronts her with<br>
    what she knows.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Why did you delete parts of your<br>
    journal?</p>
  <p> Mrs. Troi is disturbed to hear that Troi knows this.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Did something happen to you --<br>
    something you don't want me to<br>
    know about?</p>
  <p> Lwaxana's eyes fill with pain.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Leave me alone... please...</p>

  <p> But Troi won't give up.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Who is Hedril, Mother? Why is she<br>
    here?</p>
  <p> Lwaxana won't answer, her face is anguished.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Is Hedril me -- when I was a<br>
    little girl?</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    No -- I would never let anything<br>
    happen to you... never.</p>
  <p> Troi reacts to what this implies.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Did you let something happen to<br>
    someone... ?</p>
  <p> Mrs. Troi turns away, won't answer.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Was it here, at El'nar?</p>
  <p> Lwaxana answers almost despite herself.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    You were just a baby...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Tell me; whatever it is we can<br>
    face it together.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (anguished)<br>
    I can't...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You can... we can.</p>
  <p> Lwaxana seems exhausted, as if she can't fight it off<br>
    anymore.</p>

  <p>40 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> The arboretum is now sunny and bright.</p>
  <p> Troi turns at the sound of her voice and sees that<br>
    &quot;Hedril&quot; has appeared behind them. She is trying to<br>
    put a leash on a small DOG that is trying to struggle<br>
    from her grip...</p>
  <p> HEDRIL<br>
    Help me, papa...</p>
  <p> Troi's father, now in civilian clothes, is sitting on<br>
    a blanket near Hedril, taking food out of a container.<br>
    It is a family picnic, and a BABY lies sleeping in a<br>
    portable carrier.</p>

  <p> He leans over and takes the dog by the collar, attaches<br>
    the leash.</p>
  <p> MISTER TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Now hold on to him, don't let him<br>
    run off.</p>
  <p> HEDRIL<br>
    I won't...</p>
  <p> Hedril looks straight at Lwaxana and speaks to her<br>
    directly.</p>
  <p> HEDRIL<br>
    Mommy, can we go play by the<br>
    water?</p>
  <p> Lwaxana can't help but answer.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    No, Kestra... stay here with us...</p>
  <p> Troi reacts to the unfamiliar name.</p>
  <p> HEDRIL<br>
    Please?</p>
  <p> The baby starts crying --</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    Kestra, you woke your sister.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to herself)<br>
    Kestra... ?</p>

  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    What's wrong, little one... what's<br>
    wrong... ?</p>
  <p> Lwaxana is now completely inside the memory, seems<br>
    unaware that Troi is watching nearby. Try as she<br>
    might, she can't comfort the baby.</p>
  <p> The dog starts to tug at his leash, growling playfully --<br>
    which seems to delight Hedrill/Kestra.</p>
  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (to Mister Troi)<br>
    She's teething, Ian... where's her<br>
    ring... ?</p>

  <p> LWAXANA<br>
    (to Mister Troi)<br>
    I can't find it -- are you sure<br>
    it's in here?</p>
  <p> Mister Troi starts looking around as well. Behind<br>
    them, Hedril/Kestra is having trouble keeping hold of<br>
    the dog.</p>
  <p> The animal's growl grows deeper and more guttural --<br>
    it's impossible for such a tiny animal to make such a<br>
    SOUND, and we recognize it as the growl of the WOLF<br>
    Deanna heard before.</p>
  <p> As she looks down at the baby, Lwaxana's face darkens<br>
    at the sound and we cut to:</p>
  <p>40A NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> The arboretum is suddenly dark and ominous again --<br>

    together by the water's edge -- he is drenched and<br>
    exhausted. They look out at the water in shock --<br>
    they're devastated, numb. The dog barks by the water's<br>
