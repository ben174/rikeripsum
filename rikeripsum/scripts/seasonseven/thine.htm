    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE AND SHUTTLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The shuttle is heading toward the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> TROI (V.O.)<br>
    Deanna Troi Personal Log: Stardate<br>
    47611.2. I have spent the last<br>
    three days attending a reunion of<br>
    my graduating class at the Carvin<br>
    Institute for Psychological<br>
    Studies. It was a very... thought-provoking<br>
    experience.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The lighting is DIM -- the night shift is on duty.<br>
    BEVERLY in Command, ENSIGN RAINER at Tactical, other<br>
    N.D. Crewmembers at their stations.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Rainer)<br>
    Send a message to Commander Data<br>
    and inform him of our delay.</p>
  <p> RAINER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> TROI ENTERS from the Turbolift.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Deanna... welcome back.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Thank you. I just wanted to<br>
    report in. I didn't expect to<br>
    find anyone up except Data.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Data's away on assignment. A<br>
    Federation deep space probe went<br>
    off course and crashed on Barkon<br>
    Four. Some of the material in the<br>
    casing is radioactive, so Data was<br>
    sent to recover it before it<br>
    contaminates the biosphere.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; 11/30/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Isn't Barkon Four inhabited?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (nods)<br>
    There's a pre-industrial society,<br>
    but the probe crashed over a<br>
    hundred kilometers from the<br>
    nearest settlement. Data won't<br>
    have to make contact with any of<br>
    the Barkonians.</p>
  <p> Troi nods and Beverly sits in the Captain's chair and<br>
    works the arm panel for a beat.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How was the reunion?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Fine. It was good to see some old<br>
    friends... I'd fallen out of touch<br>
    with most of them.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It was interesting to see the<br>
    different paths some of their<br>
    lives have taken...</p>
  <p> Troi sits in her usual chair. There's clearly<br>
    something on Troi's mind here... something she wants to<br>
    explore...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Beverly... you don't usually stand<br>
    a watch on the Bridge even when<br>
    Data's not here... why this time?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I volunteered tonight. I like to<br>
    get in a little Bridge time now<br>
    and then... stay on top of<br>
    operations... tactical<br>
    procedures...<br>
    (beat, then smiles)<br>
    And the truth is... I like it.<br>
    Not every doctor gets to command<br>
    a starship... even if it is only<br>
    the night shift.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    May I ask you a personal<br>
    question... what made you decide<br>
    to become a commander?<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; 11/30/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI (Cont'd)<br>
    I mean, you didn't need the rank<br>
    in order to be Chief Medical<br>
    Officer... so why put yourself<br>
    through all the extra work?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't know... I never gave much<br>
    thought to my rank for a long<br>
    time... it seemed pretty trivial<br>
    compared to being a doctor.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But then, about eight years ago,<br>
    I began to feel like I wanted<br>
    to... stretch myself a little.</p>
  <p> Rainer interrupts from Tactical.</p>
  <p> RAINER<br>
    Commander... there's been no<br>
    response from Commander Data to<br>
    our signal.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Continue sending him updates on<br>
    our schedule.</p>
  <p> RAINER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Is something wrong?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No. I wanted to let Data know<br>
    that we'll have to delay picking<br>
    him up for a couple of days. We<br>
    have orders to rendezvous with the<br>
    Lexington and take medical<br>
    supplies to the Taranko Colony.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; 11/30/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But he's not responding.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Geordi said the radiation from the<br>
    probe would probably interfere<br>
    with communications... I just<br>
    thought I'd try anyway. I'm sure<br>
    he's fine... it's a very routine<br>
    mission.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>3 EXT. TOWN SQUARE - EARLY MORNING</p>
  <p> A small village on Barkon Four. The level of<br>
    technology on this planet is roughly equivalent to that<br>
    of the Renaissance on Earth and the architecture,<br>
    tools, and clothing should reflect this. The village<br>
    has several storefronts and buildings, one of which is<br>
    the Barkonian version of a small BLACKSMITH'S SHOP with<br>
    the necessary equipment and tools out in front of it.<br>
    The other storefronts should have practical doors and<br>
    a few display tables (which are now covered by drop<br>
    cloths). There is also a WELL visible in the center of<br>
    the square.</p>
  <p> A man named GARVIN and his young daughter GIA are<br>
    walking through the town square. The time of day is<br>
    early morning and there's no one else up at this hour.<br>
    Gia is carrying a black slate. Garvin is holding his<br>
    daughter's hand and walking her to school.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    (to Gia)<br>
    ... so when you return from school<br>
    tonight, I'll be meeting with the<br>
    Village Elders.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    (disappointed)<br>
    Again?</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    (chiding)<br>
    Gia...</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    (downbeat)<br>
    I know. I know you're the<br>
    magistrate and you have a lot of<br>
    work to do.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; 11/30/93 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GIA (Cont'd)<br>
    But it seems like you're always in<br>
    some meeting or --</p>
  <p> Garvin suddenly stops short in astonishment by<br>
    something he sees o.c. Gia stops too and follows his<br>
    gaze... her expression also changes to one of shock as<br>
    she sees...</p>
  <p>4 DATA</p>
  <p> Standing near the entrance to the square. His hair is<br>
    disheveled... his uniform ripped and in tatters... his<br>
    combadge gone... he's carrying a large Starfleet<br>
    CONTAINER (about the size of a briefcase) in one<br>
    hand... he looks like hell. Data opens his mouth and<br>
    tries to speak, but instead of speech, a horrible<br>
    ELECTRONIC NOISE comes out of his mouth. OFF this<br>
    strange and frightening image...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; 11/30/93 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>5 EXT. TOWN SQUARE - EARLY MORNING</p>
  <p> Continuous from the Teaser. Garvin quickly pulls Gia<br>
    away to protect her from Data. Garvin takes a couple<br>
    of steps backward.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    (to Gia, urgent)<br>
    Gia, go home. Now.</p>
  <p> He pushes her away and Gia runs a few steps away, but<br>
    she takes cover behind the well instead of actually<br>
    leaving. Gia peeks out from behind the well to see<br>
    what happens.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    (continuing,<br>
    challenging, to Data)<br>
    Who are you? What do you want?</p>
  <p> Data thinks for a long beat... then tries to work his<br>
    mouth again... the electronic noise slowly changes from<br>
    a garbled mess to recognizable sounds.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (electronic)<br>
    Wayuman... whaaaa... yuuuu...<br>
    waaaant... what d'yuuuu... what<br>
    you want... what do you want?</p>
  <p> Data seems genuinely confused... his tone of voice is<br>
    almost a plea for help... he's also not making any<br>
    threatening moves. Garvin's attitude loses a little of<br>
    its confrontational aspect as it becomes more clear<br>
    that Data is not going to attack him.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    What's wrong with you?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (electronic)<br>
    Runnnn... rung... wrong wrong<br>
    wrong... what is...<br>
    (beat, then less<br>
    electronic)<br>
    What is wrong with you?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; 11/30/93 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    There's nothing wrong with me.</p>
  <p> Data looks confused again... Garvin tries another tack.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Who are you? What is your name?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Your name? Can you understand me?<br>
    (points at himself)<br>
    My name is Garvin.</p>
  <p> Data thinks for a moment... then points to himself.<br>
    His voice is normal by now. His expression is<br>
    hopeful... he seems eager to learn and be understood.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My name is Garvin?</p>
  <p> From behind the well, Gia giggles a little. Garvin<br>
    turns around with a frown.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I thought I told you to go home.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    (downcast)<br>
    I know...</p>
  <p> Data has been thinking during this conversation and now<br>
    he seems to have figured out something.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not know my name.</p>
  <p> Garvin turns around to face him again.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You asked... if I knew my name.<br>
    I do not.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; 11/30/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    Well... at least you seem to be<br>
    understanding a little more.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. It is becoming... easier.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    Ask him where he's from, Father.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    Gia, go on to school. I'll deal<br>
    with the stranger.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    (downcast)<br>
    Yes, Father.</p>
  <p> She comes out from behind the well and begins to head<br>
    off in the original direction she and Garvin were<br>
    heading. She pauses for a moment and looks at Data.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Good-bye.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Good-bye.</p>
  <p> Gia EXITS. Garvin moves a little closer to Data...<br>
    looks over his strange clothes and appearance.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    Your eyes and skin look so...<br>
    strange. And your clothes... you<br>
    look like you've been in some kind<br>
    of accident.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not remember being in an<br>
    accident.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But then, I do not remember very<br>
    much at all.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    What do you remember?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I walked here... from the<br>
    mountains.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; 11/30/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    (amazed)<br>
    The mountains? The mountains are<br>
    over two hundred seltons from<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do have a clear memory of my<br>
    journey. It began on a steep path<br>
    in the mountains... near a large<br>
    waterfall with two jagged<br>
    promontories.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    There are several large waterfalls<br>
    up in those mountains...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    What do you remember before that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have no prior memories.</p>
  <p> Garvin looks at him for another moment... then the<br>
    container in Data's hand catches his attention.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    (re: container)<br>
    Do you know what that is?</p>
  <p> Data looks down in surprise as if noticing it for the<br>
    first time.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    (reaching out for it)<br>
    May I?</p>
  <p> Data looks at him for a moment.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    May I have it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (understanding)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Data hands it to him and Garvin sets it on a nearby<br>
    table.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; 11/30/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    There might be something in here<br>
    that can tell us who you are.</p>
  <p> Garvin bends down and examines the container for a<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p>6 CLOSE ON CONTAINER</p>
  <p> On the lid of the container, there is a Starfleet logo<br>
    and 24th century radiation symbol. It is also clearly<br>
    marked &quot;RADIOACTIVE.&quot;</p>
  <p>7 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    I wonder what these markings<br>
    mean...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (reading)<br>
    &quot;Radioactive.&quot;</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is what is written on the<br>
    container.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    You can read this language?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Evidently.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    Radioactive... what does that<br>
    mean?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not know. Perhaps it is my<br>
    name.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    I've never heard of a name like<br>
    that... you must come from a very<br>
    distant place.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; 11/30/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Garvin fumbles with the latches for a moment... then<br>
    the container OPENS, revealing a pile of METAL<br>
    FRAGMENTS inside. The fragments are twisted and burned<br>
    beyond recognition. Garvin reaches in and picks up a<br>
    chunk of metal. As he unwittingly examines this deadly<br>
    fragment...</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>8 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship hangs in space.</p>
  <p>9 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> RIKER is practicing a difficult piece of music on his<br>
    trombone, when the door to his quarters OPENS and Troi<br>
    ENTERS. She quietly moves to a chair so as not to<br>
    interrupt him. He finishes the piece and then looks<br>
    over at her expectantly. He plays a couple of notes on<br>
    the trombone which sort of emulate a &quot;voice&quot; -- the<br>
    notes and the expression on his face communicate the<br>
    words &quot;how's that?&quot; She smiles.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Is that supposed to be a question?</p>
  <p> He plays a note that sounds like &quot;yeah.&quot;</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Well, if you're asking me if I<br>
    liked what you were playing, then<br>
    the answer is yes.</p>
  <p> Riker plays &quot;thank you.&quot;</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And I think this is a much better<br>
    way of communicating for you.<br>
    It's much less... confusing than<br>
    when you try to speak normally.</p>
  <p> Riker plays a loud sour note and then sets the trombone<br>
    aside.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can always count on the ship's<br>
    Counselor to boost my self-image.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Glad to be of service.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Did you come here for something in<br>
    particular, or just for some<br>
    general Riker-bashing?</p>

    I'd actually like your opinion on<br>
    something.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I've been thinking about taking<br>
    the Bridge Officer's test and<br>
    becoming a full commander.</p>
  <p> Riker's a little surprised and it shows. He sits down<br>
    across from her.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What brought this up?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    A lot of things... working on last<br>
    month's personnel review...<br>
    talking with Beverly about her<br>
    experiences... going to my class<br>
    reunion...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ah, the class reunion... saw a few<br>
    old friends who'd taken the<br>
    test... ?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    All right, I'll admit that was a<br>
    catalyst. But I can honestly say<br>
    it's something I have thought<br>
    about off and on over the past two<br>
    years.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why the past two years?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Do you remember when the<br>
    Enterprise hit that quantum<br>
    filament... and I was left in<br>
    command on the Bridge?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I remember...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    When it happened, I felt<br>
    overwhelmed... but when it was<br>
    over...<br>

  <p> TROI (Cont'd)<br>
    I realized that a part of me<br>
    missed it... not the actual<br>
    disaster, but the experience of<br>
    being in command. When I was on<br>
    the Bridge, I felt like I was<br>
    exploring a new side of myself.<br>
    I don't want to give up counseling<br>
    by any means... but I would like<br>
    to... stretch myself a little.</p>
  <p> Riker gets up and moves around... his expression is<br>
    very thoughtful.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Deanna, if you want to take the<br>
    Bridge Officer's test, you have my<br>
    complete support. But as first<br>
    officer, I'll be judging your<br>
    performance.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And I want you to know... I'm a<br>
    pretty hard judge.</p>
  <p> She smiles at him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm a pretty good student.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'll start tomorrow -- oh eight<br>
    hundred hours.</p>
  <p> Troi heads for the door.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>10 INT. HOME - DAY</p>
  <p> A small home with a living room, a staircase, and a<br>
    dining room. Again, the furniture and decor should be<br>
    very pre-industrial, along the lines of a 15th century<br>
    Italian villa. There should be a couch large enough<br>
    for a person to recline on.</p>
  <p> Data is sitting on a chair in the middle of the main<br>
    room. TALUR, a woman in her mid-forties, is examining<br>
    Data. She's the town healer and probably the most<br>
    educated person in the village... she's also very<br>
    aware of this fact and Talur can be quite pompous and<br>
    self-important. Garvin looks on as Talur peers into<br>
    Data's open mouth with a tongue depressor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; 11/30/93 - ACT TWO 15.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    Hmmmm. Remarkable set of teeth...<br>
    no sign of decay...<br>
    (sniffs)<br>
    Breath smells like...<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    Well, it doesn't have any smell,<br>
    actually.</p>
  <p> She leans back and considers him for a moment.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You can close your mouth.</p>
  <p> Data closes his mouth and Talur puts on an alien<br>
    stethoscope and uses it to listen to Data's chest.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Heartbeat sounds a little odd...<br>
    but seems regular.</p>
  <p> She pulls back and feels his face.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Skin is... clammy. But you say<br>
    you feel fine?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    No headaches... palpitations...<br>
    sluggishness... indigestion...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No. However, I cannot have<br>
    indigestion since I have not<br>
    eaten.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    When was your last meal?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not know.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    Ah. Malnutrition. You should try<br>
    to eat something that will build<br>
    strength and return your<br>
    vitality... lots of meat...<br>
    butter... cheese... that should<br>
    be a start.</p>

  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    What about his eyes and his skin?<br>
    They're so... odd.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    (self-important)<br>
    Oh, quite so, quite so. I'm sure<br>
    my grandmother would have called<br>
    our friend here a... demon or<br>
    spirit or some kind of monster.<br>
    But current scientific methodology<br>
    allows us to dismiss such<br>
    ridiculous superstition and<br>
    concentrate on scientific reality.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then what do you believe I am?</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    (measured)<br>
    You are an ice-man.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ice-man?</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    (matter of fact)<br>
    Yes. You probably come from a<br>
    race of people who live in the<br>
    snow and ice of the Vellorian<br>
    mountains. Your skin and eye<br>
    coloration are most likely a<br>
    result of prolonged exposure to<br>
    the harsh winter conditions.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then I am not ill?</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    Other than your memory loss, you<br>
    don't have symptoms of any illness<br>
    that I'm familiar with. No, I'd<br>
    say you're an ice-man.</p>
  <p> Talur stands up and gets ready to leave.</p>

  <p> TALUR<br>

    Get something to eat and have a<br>
    good night's sleep. I'll come<br>
    back tomorrow to see if your<br>
    memory has begun to return.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Talur bows her head to him slightly and then OPENS the<br>
    door. Gia ENTERS just as Talur EXITS.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    Hello, Gia.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    Hello.</p>
  <p> Gia goes to her father with an eager expression.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What did Talur say about him? Is<br>
    he sick?</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    Not exactly. She said he's lost<br>
    his memory, but seems to be fine<br>
    otherwise. Talur thinks he is<br>
    from a race that lives in the<br>
    mountains.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am an ice-man.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    We'll have to call you something<br>
    besides Ice-man until your memory<br>
    returns. What was the word on the<br>
    container?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Radioactive.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    Mister Radioactive... ?</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    I don't like that name.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Let's call him Jayden.</p>

  <p> GARVIN<br>
    What do you think of that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is acceptable. What is the<br>
    origin of that name?</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    (eager)<br>
    It's from a story. Jayden was a<br>
    boy who looked different from<br>
    everyone else. The other children<br>
    were mean to him and made fun of<br>
    him, but Jayden never got angry.<br>
    It turned out that he was really<br>
    a handsome nobleman who had been<br>
    put under the spell of a demon and--</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    That can wait until later, Gia.<br>
    Right now, we should clean him up<br>
    and get him something decent to<br>
    wear. Run upstairs and get some<br>
    of my old clothes for him.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    Yes, Father.</p>
  <p> Gia goes up the stairs as Garvin moves to the open<br>
    container of metal and looks at the fragments for a<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    (thoughtful)<br>
    I wonder if Skoran could tell us<br>
    something about this metal of<br>
    yours...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>11 EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY</p>
  <p> The Town is now alive with activity. PEOPLE are moving<br>
    through the square... shopkeepers are selling their<br>
    wares outside the storefronts... someone is using the<br>
    well to fill a bucket with water, etc. In front of the<br>
    Blacksmith's shop, Garvin is showing the metal to<br>
    SKORAN, the village blacksmith. Skoran is a large,<br>
    burly man with powerful arms and what seems like a<br>
    permanent scowl on his face. Data is standing nearby<br>
    and he continues to draw curious looks from passersby<br>
    in the b.g. during the conversation. He is now dressed<br>
    in native clothes and his hair has been combed and<br>
    parted in a new way.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; REV. 12/07/93 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The container of metal fragments is sitting on a table<br>
    in front of Skoran, who keeps throwing suspicious looks<br>
    at Data. Behind them an APPRENTICE is pounding metal<br>
    on an ANVIL of alien design which is supported by a<br>
    wooden base. Skoran is examining one of the pieces.</p>
  <p> SKORAN<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    You. Ice-man, where did you find<br>
    this?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not know.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    I told you, he's lost his<br>
    memory... and we're calling him<br>
    Jayden for now.</p>
  <p> SKORAN<br>
    Jayden, huh?</p>
  <p> Skoran obviously is uncomfortable around Data, but he<br>
    tries to concentrate on the metal.</p>
  <p> SKORAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The metal is slightly warm...</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    All the fragments are like that.</p>
  <p> SKORAN<br>
    (noncommittal)<br>
    Hmmmm.</p>
  <p> He takes the fragment and moves to the anvil. Skoran<br>
    takes a pair of tongs and a hammer from his Apprentice<br>
    and POUNDS the fragment for a moment. The fragment<br>
    flattens out on the anvil. Skoran scowls at it for a<br>
    long moment.</p>
  <p> They move away from the anvil and the Apprentice goes<br>
    back to work.</p>
  <p> SKORAN<br>
    It's obviously been tempered and<br>
    milled... but the lusterous<br>
    quality of the metal is so pure...<br>
    this wasn't made in any forge I've<br>
    ever seen.<br>

    Will you sell them?</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    You want them?</p>
  <p> SKORAN<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    The metal's malleable enough to<br>
    make some jewelry.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    They belong to Jayden.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Do you want to sell them? You are<br>
    going to need money.</p>
  <p> Garvin looks to Data who thinks about this for a<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You may be right. But I do not<br>
    wish to sell all the fragments.<br>
    They could provide a clue to my<br>
    identity.</p>
  <p> SKORAN<br>
    I'll give you twenty doraks for<br>
    half the lot.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    Agreed.</p>
  <p> Skoran dumps most of the fragments out of the container<br>
    onto the table.</p>
  <p>12 CLOSE ON ANVIL BASE</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the wooden base beneath the anvil cracks and<br>
    then COLLAPSES.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; 11/30/93 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>13 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> The anvil comes crashing down on the leg of the<br>
    Apprentice, who SCREAMS in pain. Garvin and Skoran<br>
    rush to him.</p>
  <p> APPRENTICE<br>
    My leg! Get it off! Get it off!</p>
  <p> Skoran and Garvin struggle, but they can't lift the<br>
    heavy object.</p>
  <p> SKORAN<br>
    We need a lever.</p>
  <p> They both let go of the anvil. Skoran moves to get a<br>
    long pole, while Garvin tries to comfort the<br>
    Apprentice.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    It will be all right. Don't<br>
    struggle it will only...</p>
  <p> Garvin breaks off as the anvil is LIFTED by Data. Both<br>
    Garvin and the Apprentice look up at him in shock as he<br>
    lifts the heavy object without difficulty. Skoran<br>
    drops the pole he was carrying and his eyes go wide.<br>
    Data suddenly becomes aware of the silence around him<br>
    and he turns to see that EVERYONE in the town square<br>
    has stopped what they were doing and are now staring at<br>
    him silently. Garvin finally recovers and stands up.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    (continuing, quiet)<br>
    Jayden... put it down.</p>
  <p> Data puts down the anvil. After a beat, some of the<br>
    townspeople rush in and carry away the injured<br>
    Apprentice.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Skoran)<br>
    I believe the support structure of<br>
    the anvil collapsed because some<br>
    of the wood had rotted.</p>
  <p> Skoran nods silently, still amazed at what he's seen.<br>
    Data looks around and notices he is getting odd looks<br>
    from everyone.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Did I do something wrong, Garvin?</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    No... just unexpected.</p>

  <p>14 INT. HOME - NIGHT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Later that evening. Data, Garvin, Gia, and Talur are<br>
    sitting around the table, in the midst of dinner.<br>
    Talur is holding forth again, very confident of her<br>
    ability to explain everything. Mid-conversation.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    It's perfectly understandable.<br>
    Your people probably all have<br>
    great strength... it would allow<br>
    them to fight off the ferocious<br>
    creatures that live in the<br>
    Vellorian Mountains.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You have told me no one from the<br>
    village has ever been to the<br>
    Vellorian Mountains. How do you<br>
    know there are... ferocious<br>
    creatures there?</p>
  <p> Talur is caught a little off-guard.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    It is... a well-known fact.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But no one has actually seen one?</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    Not to my knowledge...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In the absence of empirical data<br>
    on these creatures, how can you<br>
    support your theory about the<br>
    nature of my strength?</p>
  <p> Talur manages a weak smile.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    You certainly have a lot of<br>
    questions, Jayden. I'm sure that<br>
    once your memory returns, a great<br>

  <p> GARVIN<br>
    That sounds like a good idea.<br>

    I'll be back soon.</p>
  <p> Garvin and Talur EXIT. Gia picks up her plate and Data<br>
    helps her to clear the table. They take the dishes to<br>

    I'm afraid I can't tell you that.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why not? What kind of test is<br>
    this?</p>

    It's the kind of test you'll have<br>
    to take again if you want to be a<br>
    Bridge Officer. And next time,<br>
    the problem won't be so easy, so<br>
    you better study up on emergency<br>

  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>18 EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY</p>
  <p> Talur is teaching a group of CHILDREN in the center of<br>
    town. The children are seated around her and busily<br>
    scribbling on their slates as Talur lectures. Data and<br>
    Gia are also in the class. Gia is wearing a necklace<br>
    with a PENDANT made from the same type of metal seen<br>
    earlier.</p>
  <p> Talur is holding a small piece of WOOD. Sitting nearby<br>
    is a lit CANDLE. As Talur expounds on the nature of<br>
    fire and matter, Data becomes more and more concerned --<br>
    this doesn't sound right to him.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    Fire, rock, sky, and water are the<br>
    basic elements of the universe.<br>
    They can be found in every object,<br>
    every person, every animal --<br>
    everything.</p>
  <p> Talur holds up the wood.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The rock in this wood can be felt<br>
    by its weight and by its hardness.<br>
    If we expose the wood to flame...</p>
  <p> She uses the candle to LIGHT the end of the wood.</p>

  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We can encourage the fire in the<br>
    wood to show itself.<br>
    (waves hand through<br>
    smoke from wood)<br>
    We also see smoke, which is a part<br>
    of the sky. But, the water in<br>
    wood is very difficult to see.<br>
    Sometimes the basic elements can<br>
    be hidden deep within objects, but<br>
    all four elements are always<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> Data finally raises his hand.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    Yes, Jayden?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not believe that is correct.</p>
  <p> Everyone looks at him in surprise. Talur is more<br>
    bemused than threatened by his assertion.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    Oh?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe you are reasoning by<br>
    analogy -- classifying objects and<br>
    phenomena according to superficial<br>
    observation rather than by<br>
    empirical evidence.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    For example, wood does not contain<br>
    fire simply because it is<br>
    combustible. Nor does it contain<br>
    rock simply because it is heavy.<br>
    Wood, like any complex organic<br>
    form, is composed of thousands of<br>
    different chemical compounds, none<br>
    of which is fire.</p>
  <p> Talur's bemusement starts to become irritation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; REV. 12/07/93 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    (firm)<br>
    Jayden, that will be enough.<br>
    (to all)<br>
    As I told you earlier, our friend<br>
    Jayden has lost much of his<br>
    memory. So don't put too much<br>
    faith in his... ideas.</p>
  <p> The children all nod in agreement. Data frowns in<br>
    thought as he tries to reconcile this with what he<br>
    knows to be true.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    I think that will be all for<br>
    today, class. I'll see you<br>
    tomorrow. Be sure to practice<br>
    your arithmetic and spelling<br>
    tonight.</p>
  <p> The class breaks up and Gia moves to Data.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    Are you all right?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. But I do not agree with<br>
    Talur's assessment. Although I do<br>
    have... gaps in my memory, I know<br>
    that fire is not an element.</p>
  <p> Suddenly their attention is drawn to a loud argument at<br>
    the Blacksmith's shop.</p>
  <p> GARVIN'S VOICE<br>
    That is not what you promised me!</p>
  <p>19 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Including the Blacksmith's shop. Data and Gia approach<br>
    as Garvin is arguing loudly with Skoran.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; REV. 12/07/93 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The metal fragments seen earlier are on display on the<br>
    table, but some of them have been pounded into various<br>
    pieces of jewelry. Garvin is wearing one of the metal<br>
    fragments as a pin on his shirt. Garvin's skin is<br>
    getting blotchy and red... even small blisters in some<br>
    areas.</p>
  <p> SKORAN<br>
    You're getting old, Garvin. I<br>
    offered fifteen for the metal and<br>
    I've given it to you. No more.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    We agreed on twenty.</p>
  <p> Skoran shakes his head when Data intervenes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Garvin is correct. You did agree<br>
    on twenty.</p>
  <p> SKORAN<br>
    (annoyed)<br>
    Stay out of this, Ice-man. Your<br>
    memory's not very reliable.</p>

  <p>19 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Suddenly Garvin puts a hand to his head and nearly<br>
    falls over. Skoran catches him before he can fall.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    Father! Father, what's wrong?</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    (weak)<br>
    I don't know... I feel... very<br>
    weak suddenly.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    You've got a fever.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    We should get him home.</p>
  <p> Data and Gia help Garvin make his way across the town<br>
    square. Skoran looks after them with a scowl of hatred<br>
    on his face.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>20 INT. HOME - DAY</p>
  <p> Garvin is lying on the couch as Talur finishes looking<br>
    him over. There is a small bag with her medical herbs<br>
    and primitive instruments sitting on the floor. Gia<br>
    and Data look on with concern. Garvin's skin is<br>
    beginning to show signs of radiation poisoning --<br>
    blisters, red spots, discoloration. Talur peers into<br>
    Garvin's eyes... feels his forehead... then notices a<br>
    tuft of HAIR on the pillow beside Garvin. She runs her<br>
    fingers through his hair experimentally, and is<br>
    surprised when a large amount of hair comes away in her<br>
    hand.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    What's wrong with him?</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    I suspect that he --</p>
  <p> She hesitates, forced to admit that, for once, she<br>
    doesn't have an answer.</p>

  <p> TALUR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I don't know. I've never<br>
    encountered anything like this<br>
    before.</p>
  <p> Talur reaches into her bag and brings out a primitive<br>
    MICROSCOPE. This scope is designed to examine objects<br>
    the size of a hand, not slides, and so it should have<br>
    a large magnifying lens and is hand-held. Talur uses<br>
    it to examine Garvin's skin.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    These lesions look like burn<br>
    marks.</p>
  <p> Talur puts down the microscope and thinks for a moment.<br>
    Data picks it up and looks at the device with<br>
    curiosity.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    The fluids in his body have been<br>
    overheated... that would explain<br>
    the fever and the burning skin.<br>
    (to Gia)<br>
    Keep him cool, let plenty of fresh<br>
    air into the house...<br>
    (takes something out of<br>
    bag)<br>
    ... and give him these herbs. That<br>
    should bring his fluidic<br>
    temperature down and allow this to<br>
    pass.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    I understand.</p>
  <p> Talur begins to put away her things.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (re: microscope)<br>
    With an increased focal length and<br>
    an achromatic objective lens this<br>
    instrument will have a higher<br>
    effective magnification.</p>
  <p> Talur holds out her hand and clears her throat in<br>
    irritation. Data realizes what she wants and then<br>
    hands her the microscope.</p>

  <p> Talur EXITS. Data looks at Garvin for a moment.</p>

    Garvin, with your permission, I<br>

    There he is!</p>
  <p> They turn to see Skoran, his apprentice and several<br>

    same blistering and skin blotches as Garvin.</p>
  <p> SKORAN<br>

    It's his fault! None of us were<br>

  <p>A22 INT. HOME - DAY<br>
    (FORMERLY SCENE 24)</p>
  <p> Data has turned the dining room of the house into a<br>
    laboratory crammed with home-made equipment. Reams of<br>
    paper filled with complex calculations and diagrams are<br>
    littered across the floor... test tubes and beakers<br>
    are sitting on every flat surface... (Garvin is no<br>
    longer on the couch.)</p>
  <p> Data is hunched over a new and more sophisticated<br>
    MICROSCOPE. Talur ENTERS the room and looks around in<br>
    astonishment.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    Jayden... what are you doing?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am studying tissue samples from<br>
    Garvin and Gia in an attempt to<br>
    isolate the cause of the illness.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Gia?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. She is also beginning to<br>
    show signs of the illness.</p>
  <p> Talur takes in that bad news for a moment, then her<br>
    curiosity is piqued by the sight of the microscope.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    What is that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is a magnifying device based on<br>
    your hand-held instrument. I have<br>
    refined the design to increase the<br>
    magnification level.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>

    May I?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Of course.</p>

    How strong is the magnification?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Objects appear approximately five<br>
    hundred times their normal size.</p>
  <p> Talur looks back through the microscope.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    As you can see, the cellular<br>
    damage is quite extensive.<br>
    However, based on the interstitial<br>
    transparency and membrane<br>
    integrity, I do not believe this<br>
    is an infection or any form of<br>
    communicable disease.</p>
  <p> Most of what Data is saying might as well be Greek to<br>
    Talur, but it is in her nature to appear to know more<br>
    than she does.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    I see...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    At the moment, I am looking for a<br>
    common experience or event that<br>
    Garvin, Skoran, and Gia might have<br>
    shared that could have a causal<br>
    relationship to their illness.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    Well... they've all been here in<br>
    the village for many years. I'm<br>
    sure there have been many common<br>
    experiences.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, but since this illness struck<br>
    all three of them in a relatively<br>
    short period of time, it is<br>
    reasonable to assume that the<br>
    experience would be recent and<br>
    unusual.</p>
  <p> Talur thinks for a moment.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    Actually Jayden... encountering<br>
    you has been the most unusual<br>
    experience that they've all shared<br>
    recently.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    I am aware of that. And I am open<br>
    to the possibility that I am in<br>
    some way the causal factor. But<br>
    since you have had a great deal of<br>
    contact with me and have shown no<br>
    sign of the sickness, I tend to<br>
    discount myself as a likely<br>
    candidate.</p>
  <p> Talur nods, that makes sense.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    Still... it does seem to be more<br>
    than a coincidence that shortly<br>
    after you arrived, people started<br>
    to become ill.</p>

    I agree.</p>
  <p> Gia now ENTERS by coming down the stairs. She does<br>
    indeed show signs of the illness -- blotches on her<br>

    Run program.</p>
  <p> Everything springs to life. The ship is at RED ALERT<br>
    and in the middle of a crisis.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; REV. 12/0193 - ACT FOUR 38.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The control system for the primary<br>
    containment field is not<br>
    functioning.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Something's severed the ODN<br>
    conduit between here and the antimatter<br>
    storage deck.</p>
  <p> Troi gives Geordi a long, grim look before going on.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (measured)<br>
    Geordi... could you repair the ODN<br>
    conduit if you went into that<br>
    crawlway?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    Sir. That crawlway is in a warp<br>
    plasma shaft. He would never<br>
    survive the radiation.</p>
  <p> Troi steels herself.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I know that. Geordi, could you<br>
    repair the conduit?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I... think so.</p>
  <p> This is one of the hardest things Troi has ever done...<br>
    and she struggles with it for a moment before facing<br>
    Geordi directly and making the decision.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Then do it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    That's an order.</p>
  <p> Geordi glances at Worf, then accepts his fate.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Geordi EXITS to the Jefferies Tube and the doors close<br>
    behind him. Troi looks after him for a long beat.</p>

  <p>23 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Worf and the other Engineers now VANISH from the room,<br>
    leaving Troi alone. Riker ENTERS the scene and<br>
    approaches her.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Something told me you wouldn't let<br>
    this go.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Congratulations. You passed.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    That's what this was all about,<br>
    wasn't it? To see if I could<br>
    order someone to their death.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's right.</p>
  <p> Troi is somber... quiet.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I always knew that was part of<br>
    being in command... I thought I<br>
    was prepared for it... but when<br>
    the moment came, I hesitated. It<br>
    took me four times to realize that<br>
    was the answer.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Maybe you were right. Maybe I'm<br>
    not cut out for this.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You did exactly what you needed to<br>
    do. You tried every<br>
    alternative... looked at all the<br>
    options, and in the end you made<br>
    the hard choice.<br>
    (beat, then smiles)<br>
    Come on, let's get out of here...<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> She looks up at him and then seems to accept his words.<br>
    They EXIT together...</p>

  <p>24 OMITTED</p>
  <p>25 INT. HOME - NIGHT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data is hard at work in his &quot;lab&quot; in the dining room.<br>
    Talur is standing nearby, looking on in fascination as<br>
    Data sets up an experiment. Data is holding a cloth<br>
    SCREEN about one foot square.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have coated this piece of cloth<br>
    with the liquid which is used in<br>
    lamps.</p>
  <p> Data places the screen in a small HOLDER sitting on the<br>
    table and then picks up a lamp and brings it near the<br>
    screen.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You can see that the cloth becomes<br>
    luminescent when exposed to an<br>
    energy source.</p>
  <p> The cloth does indeed look slightly luminous. Data now<br>
    picks up the metal pendant from Gia and sets it near<br>
    the screen.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; REV. 12/02/93 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>26 ON SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> There is a VISIBLE pattern of LIGHT on the screen. It<br>
    should look something like the pattern from a shotgun<br>
    burst.</p>
  <p>27 RESUME SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Talur looks at the screen with curiosity.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    Where is this pattern of light<br>
    coming from?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe a stream of particles is<br>
    emanating from the metallic<br>
    pendant and hitting the cloth.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    (skeptical)<br>
    I don't see any... particles<br>
    coming from the pendant.</p>
  <p> Data thinks for a moment... then picks up the Starfleet<br>
    container seen earlier and puts it between the metal<br>
    and the screen.</p>
  <p>28 ON SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The pattern of light DISAPPEARS.</p>
  <p>29 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It would appear that the container<br>
    is constructed from a material<br>
    which can block or absorb the<br>
    particles coming from the metal.</p>
  <p> Talur is still skeptical, but not so sure of herself<br>
    any longer.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    It's... a trick...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No. It is empirical data. I<br>
    believe that the fragments were<br>
    originally placed in this<br>
    container to protect people from<br>
    accidental exposure.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; REV. 12/01/93 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA (Cont'd)<br>
    The word &quot;radioactive&quot; may be a<br>
    warning about the dangerous nature<br>
    of the metal.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    All right... let's say for the<br>
    moment that you're right and there<br>
    are... invisible particles coming<br>
    from this metal. What should we<br>
    do?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will continue with my<br>
    experiments. I would like you to<br>
    gather all the pieces of metal in<br>
    the village. Put them back in<br>
    this container.</p>
  <p> Talur thinks about this for a moment... then decides to<br>
    go along with him. She picks up the container.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    All right.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But when I return, I'll want a<br>
    more thorough explanation of all<br>
    this. I want to examine your data<br>
    in detail.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> Talur EXITS the house. Data goes back to the work area<br>
    and resumes his work. After a few beats, there is a<br>
    POUNDING on the door. Data goes to it and OPEN the<br>
    door, revealing Skoran, and ONE burly-looking MAN.<br>
    Skoran doesn't look at all well, the blotches are<br>
    starting to show up on his skin. Both of them are<br>
    carrying some kind of crude weapon -- an axe handle, a<br>
    metal rod, a pickaxe. One of the men is carrying a<br>
    lantern. They push their way into the room... they all<br>
    glower at Data in obvious hatred.</p>
  <p> SKORAN<br>
    (threatening)<br>
    There you are...</p>
  <p> The three men all form a circle around Data.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; REV. 11/30/93 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> SKORAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You're the cause of all this, Iceman.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If you are referring to the<br>
    illness, you are partially<br>
    correct, but it is more complex<br>
    than that. You see, the metal<br>
    fragments that --</p>
  <p> Skoran swings an axe handle at Data, who deftly blocks<br>
    it, but then one of the men swings a metal rod at<br>
    Data's face... the rod glances off Data, but it also<br>
    RIPS AWAY a portion of his SKIN, revealing a METAL<br>
    structure underneath. All three men stagger back in<br>
    shock and fear.</p>
  <p> SKORAN<br>
    (continuing, horrified)<br>
    What... what are you?</p>
  <p> Data reaches up with one hand and touches the bare<br>
    metal of his face -- he's a little surprised as well.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not know.</p>
  <p> The three men run out of the room in terror. Data<br>
    turns and looks at himself in the mirror... he's<br>
    shocked by the image of his android self laid bare.<br>
    OFF his reaction...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; REV. 12/01/93 - ACT FIVE 47.</p>
  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>30 INT. HOME - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Talur is putting the last of the metallic jewelry into<br>
    the container. She closes the container and then moves<br>
    to where Skoran and several other people are gathered<br>
    around the very sick Garvin, who is propped up on a<br>
    small couch. Gia is tending to his fever -- though<br>
    she, too, is clearly ill. Skoran and the rest of the<br>
    townspeople are armed with crude weapons.</p>
  <p> SKORAN<br>
    I saw it with my own eyes. He is<br>
    not a person, he is some kind<br>
    of... creature.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    (to Garvin)<br>
    It's not true, Father.</p>
  <p> SKORAN<br>
    We have to find him and stop him<br>
    before he kills us all.</p>
  <p> GARVIN<br>
    (weak)<br>
    I don't... not Jayden... he<br>
    wouldn't try to hurt... us...</p>
  <p> But finally, Garvin's eyes flutter and he falls asleep.</p>
  <p> SKORAN<br>
    (to others)<br>
    Come on.</p>
  <p> Skoran and the townspeople EXIT.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    (to Gia, re: Garvin)<br>
    Let him rest for now.<br>
    (looks at her)<br>
    You should rest as well. Exerting<br>
    yourself will only make you<br>
    sicker.</p>
  <p> Gia nods in understanding.</p>
  <p> TALUR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'll be back.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; REV. 12/01/93 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She gives the girl a kiss on the head and then EXITS.<br>
    Gia looks at her sleeping father for a moment... then<br>
    moves into the living room and stares at the strange<br>
    lab equipment strewn about.</p>
  <p> DATA'S VOICE<br>
    (o.c.)<br>
    Gia?</p>
  <p> Gia whirls around and sees Data standing near the back<br>
    door. His face is partially covered by a scarf which<br>
    hides the wound. Gia is at once relieved and scared to<br>
    see him. Her words come tumbling out in a torrent.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    (desperate)<br>
    Jayden. Everyone's looking for<br>
    you. Skoran said that you're some<br>
    kind of creature.</p>
  <p> She stares at him, her breath coming in ragged heaves<br>
    as the anxiety and radiation sickness begin to catch up<br>
    with her.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not know what I am. But I am<br>
    not like you.</p>
  <p> Gia takes a step back from him.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    I know... you're an Ice-man. We<br>
    talked about that...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No. I am not...</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    Jayden... why are you wearing that<br>
    scarf?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not wish to scare you.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    I won't be afraid. Take it off.</p>
  <p> Data hesitates for a moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; REV. 12/06/93 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Please. I have to see.</p>
  <p> Data finally relents and pulls away the scarf revealing<br>
    the metallic workings of his head. Gia recoils from<br>
    the sight, but doesn't run.</p>
  <p> Gia tries to steady herself... she wants desperately to<br>
    believe in Data, but his hideous visage is difficult to<br>
    overcome. Data looks over at the mirror on the wall...<br>
    gazes into his own reflection for a moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I understand your reaction. I<br>
    must admit, I do not know what I<br>
    am.</p>
  <p> A beat, then he turns to Gia.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But I do not wish to harm you.<br>
    You or Garvin or anyone else. I<br>
    only wish to help... to find a<br>
    cure for the illness. I was<br>
    getting very close. I need to<br>
    continue my work, but it will take<br>
    time. How long will it be until<br>
    Skoran and the others return?</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    I don't know... they're out<br>
    looking for you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then I must hurry.</p>
  <p> Data moves to the lab table...</p>
  <p> TIME CUT:</p>
  <p>31 INT. HOME - NIGHT</p>
  <p> It is now several hours later and Data comes down the<br>
    stairs. Gia is asleep in a chair nearby. There are<br>
    many more stacks of paper and slides and beakers are<br>
    scattered across the room to indicate the passage of<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; REV. 12/06/93 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> After a beat, data seems satisfied with what he sees<br>
    through the microscope, makes a final notation on a<br>
    piece of paper, then moves to Gia and gently wakes her<br>
    up.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Gia... I believe I have found the<br>
    answer.</p>
  <p> Gia is groggy and clearly getting a little worse.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    You... you found a cure?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe so.</p>
  <p> On the table can be seen a mortar and pestle filled<br>
    with METALLIC DUST, a large BUCKET filled with a<br>
    silvery solution, and several other petrie dishes with<br>
    odd-looking chemicals in them. As Data pours a small<br>
    amount of silvery liquid onto a spoon:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I tested this medicine on skin<br>
    samples from your father. They<br>
    showed improvement, so I gave him<br>
    a spoonful. He is now recovering.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    What kind of medicine is it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A compound I made which will<br>
    neutralize the particles that are<br>
    making you ill.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; 11/30/93 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Swallow this.</p>
  <p> Data helps her to swallow the liquid. She makes a face<br>
    at the taste.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I am sorry that I did not have<br>
    time to create a more palatable<br>
    flavor.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    (weak)<br>
    That's all right... it's no worse.<br>
    than... grandmother's soup.</p>
  <p> Data moves to the bucket and puts a lid on it. He<br>
    frowns in thought.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I must administer this to everyone<br>
    in the village, but I do not think<br>
    they will trust me after what<br>
    happened with Skoran.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    I could... tell them...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am afraid they will not believe<br>
    you either.<br>
    (thinks)<br>
    Gia, is the well in the town<br>
    square the only source of water<br>
    for this village?</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    (groggy)<br>
    Well... ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This is very important. Are there<br>
    any other sources of fresh water<br>
    near the village?</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    No... the nearest river is... two<br>
    days away...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; REV. 12/01/93 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then I will put the compound into<br>
    the well water. It will be<br>
    diluted, but it should still have<br>
    enough potency to work.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    The compound... the well...</p>
  <p> Her eyes flutter and she falls asleep. Data arranges<br>
    her comfortably on the couch and then pulls a blanket<br>
    over her. He looks down at her peaceful face for a<br>
    moment, then grabs the bucket and heads for the door...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>32 EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The square is deserted. Data cautiously moves into the<br>
    square... looks around to make sure no one is watching<br>
    and then heads for the well. The well has a large<br>
    wooden cover over it, with a few metal latches to<br>
    secure it. Data sets down the bucket and is starting<br>
    to unhook the latches when suddenly we hear Skoran's<br>
    voice from o.c.</p>
  <p> SKORAN'S VOICE<br>
    There he is!</p>
  <p> Data turns and now we can see Skoran and a large group<br>
    of Townspeople ENTER the square from an alleyway. Most<br>
    of them have crude weapons and some are carrying<br>
    LANTERNS. They're in an ugly mood as they close in on<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> SKORAN<br>
    (points to Data's face)<br>
    You see? It's just as I said...</p>
  <p> This is met with nods of assent and muttered threats<br>
    from the mob.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I only wish to help you...</p>
  <p> Skoran coughs painfully, doubling over in agony... he's<br>
    feverish, almost delirious with the sickness.</p>
  <p> SKORAN<br>
    (coughing)<br>
    This is how you've helped us... by<br>
    bringing this plague...<br>

  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SKORAN (Cont'd)<br>
    ... tried to kill us all... but you<br>
    won't succeed... I won't let you!</p>
  <p> With that, Skoran rushes toward Data.. the townspeople<br>
    go with him...</p>
  <p> -- Data flings back the cover on the well and picks up<br>
    the bucket. He quickly begins pouring the liquid into<br>
    the well.</p>
  <p> -- Finally, Skoran rushes up and DRIVES a spear through<br>
    Data's back, IMPALING him on the metal rod.</p>
  <p> -- Data begins to jerk and there is a small SPRAY OF<br>
    SPARKS from where he was stabbed.</p>
  <p> -- The last of the liquid is poured into the well and<br>
    the bucket slips from Data's hand onto the ground.<br>
    Data turns and looks at the now quiet crowd, jerks once<br>
    or twice... then falls to the ground, dead.</p>
  <p> Talur pushes her way through the crowd and then kneels<br>
    down by Data. She feels for a pulse, but finds none.<br>
    Talur picks up the bucket and looks at it with<br>
    curiosity and then looks back down at Data. Hold for<br>
    a long beat on this quiet and tragic scene.</p>
  <p> TIME CUT:</p>
  <p>33 EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY</p>
  <p> A normal busy day in the square with people moving<br>
    about and merchants hawking their wares. Riker and<br>
    Beverly ENTER the village, disguised as natives. They<br>
    look around for a few beats, then Beverly's eye is<br>
    caught by a group of children walking through the<br>
    square. One of the children is Gia. She looks<br>
    completely recovered from her sickness. As the<br>
    children pass by the well, Gia slows down and then<br>
    stops, looking down at something on the ground.<br>
    Beverly &amp; Riker walk over to her.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Excuse me. We're looking for a<br>
    friend of ours. He may have<br>
    wandered into your village a few<br>
    days ago.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You'd remember him... his<br>
    appearance would have been very...<br>
    strange. Pale skin, gold eyes...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; REV. 12/01/93 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Gia reacts in sadness.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    He was your friend?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes. You know him?</p>
  <p> Gia nods.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where is he?</p>
  <p> Gia points down and now we can see that there is a<br>
    crude stone marker next to the well with an alien<br>
    inscription on it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    I don't understand.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    We didn't know his real name, so<br>
    we called him Jayden.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you saying... he's dead?</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    They killed him because they were<br>
    afraid of him.. But he saved all<br>
    of us from the sickness.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The sickness?</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    There were these pieces of<br>
    metal... they made everyone sick.<br>
    But Jayden put something in the<br>
    water... and now everyone's<br>
    better.</p>
  <p> Riker and Beverly exchange a look -- they realize she<br>
    must be referring to the radioactive debris.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What happened to these... pieces<br>
    of metal?</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    We buried them out in the forest.</p>

  <p> She looks down at the grave for a moment.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What was his real name?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> GIA<br>
    Data.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He was my friend too.</p>
  <p> Gia gets up and walks away. Beverly and Riker exchange<br>
    a look, then Beverly surreptitious pulls out a<br>
    tricorder and quickly scans the ground.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    It's Data all right... he's buried<br>
    about two meters down. He's been<br>
    deactivated... I can't tell how<br>
    bad the damage is.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We can beam him and the probe<br>
    fragments up to the ship and no<br>
    one will know.</p>
  <p> Beverly nods and they begin to head out of town.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>34 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship in orbit.</p>
  <p>35 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Data is lying on the table, still dressed as we saw him<br>
    in the town square. There is a jagged hole in his<br>
    uniform with some circuitry hanging out where the metal<br>
    rod punctured him. Beverly is using a DEVICE on his<br>
    head and checking the readings on a tricorder. Troi,<br>
    PICARD and Riker look on.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Positronic net is on-line... sub-processor<br>
    relays in place... neuro-electrical<br>
    systems enabled.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; REV. 11/30/93 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She reaches underneath Data's back and activates him by<br>
    using his &quot;on&quot; switch. Data suddenly sits up, fully<br>
    conscious.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Data... are you all right?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not know. I am... surprised<br>
    to find myself here. I thought I<br>
    was on Barkon Four.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's the last thing you<br>
    remember?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I had located the crashed<br>
    Federation probe and collected the<br>
    radioactive fragments. I was<br>
    attempting to download the sensor<br>
    logs from the probe's on board<br>
    computer when there was a... power<br>
    surge. I believe the surge<br>
    overloaded my positronic matrix.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    After that... I have no memory<br>
    until this moment.</p>
  <p> He looks down at his clothes and at the jagged hole in<br>
    his chest.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But it would appear that I had...<br>
    an interesting time.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We don't know much about what<br>
    happened either... except you<br>
    apparently saved an entire village<br>
    from radiation poisoning...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And you were a very special friend<br>
    to a little girl.</p>
  <p> Data ponders these statements, but they make no sense<br>
    to him at all.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; REV. 11/30/93 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If you'll excuse me, I have the<br>
    Bridge for this watch.</p>
  <p> Data reacts and now notices that Troi is wearing<br>
    Commander's pips.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Counselor, have you been promoted<br>
    during my absence?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's right.<br>
    (joking)<br>
    Which means you can call me &quot;sir&quot;<br>
    from now on.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker and Beverly exchange smiles as Troi EXITS. OFF<br>
    Data's puzzled look...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
