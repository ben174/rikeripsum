    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - CEMETERY - DAY</p>
  <p> A traditional FUNERAL is in progress. A large group of<br>
    MOURNERS, dressed in black, are gathered around a<br>
    COFFIN. The setting is a SUNNY clearing surrounded by<br>
    a large HEDGE. Stone-carved TOMBSTONES and other<br>
    traditional graveyard details can be seen. PICARD and<br>
    TROI are there, as well -- wearing their dress<br>
    uniforms.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY is standing at the head of the coffin, speaking<br>
    to the group. It's a eulogy, and Beverly speaks with<br>
    great fondness.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to all)<br>
    Most people on this colony will<br>
    remember my grandmother as a<br>
    &quot;healer&quot;... but her abilities<br>
    went beyond that. She didn't just<br>
    relieve pain, or fight illness...<br>
    because she knew that well-being<br>
    is more than a healthy body. Her<br>
    remedies included words of advice<br>
    as often as they did medicinal<br>
    teas...<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    And sometimes they were just as<br>
    bitter-tasting.</p>
  <p> As she speaks, the crowd listens intently... the mood<br>
    is somber.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But Nana's favorite thing was<br>
    cooking. My most vivid memories<br>
    growing up were of Nana in the<br>
    kitchen... the sounds of bubbling<br>
    pots and wooden spoons... the<br>
    exotic tastes and smells...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    In fact, she was in the middle of<br>
    writing a cook book when she died.<br>
    I'd like to share with you one of<br>
    her recipes... it was my favorite.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Beverly picks up a PADD and begins to read from it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (reads)<br>
    &quot;Nana's Gingerbread. Mix one gram<br>
    currants... six hundred<br>
    milliliters of flour... two<br>
    hundred milliliters buttermilk...<br>
    and a dollop of molasses... &quot;<br>
    (beat)<br>
    &quot;Two pinches of ginger and<br>
    cinnamon... and two hundred<br>
    milliliters of sugar.&quot;</p>
  <p> As she reads, we see that the people in the crowd --<br>
    Picard, Troi, and the others -- are all smiling. The<br>
    recipe is soothing... a moment of peace and grounding<br>
    in this tragic time.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing, reads)<br>
    &quot;Heat the oven until it's happy...<br>
    then pour the batter into the arms<br>
    of a welcoming pan... &quot;<br>
    (an aside)<br>
    I never knew when an oven was<br>
    happy, and I never saw arms on a<br>
    pan... but it sure tasted great.</p>
  <p> Beverly sets down the PADD.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'll miss Felisa Howard very<br>
    much... her healing... her<br>
    advice... and most of all, her<br>
    gingerbread.</p>
  <p> A quiet moment, then Beverly steps to the side of the<br>
    grave. GOVERNOR MATURIN -- an ALIEN man in his late<br>
    fifties -- steps forward. As he speaks, FOUR<br>
    PALLBEARERS start to lower the coffin into the ground.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> MATURIN<br>
    (to all)<br>
    &quot;And so now we commit her body to<br>
    the ground; earth to earth, ashes<br>
    to ashes, dust to dust... in sure<br>
    and certain hope that her memory<br>
    will be kept alive within us all.&quot;</p>
  <p> The mourners begin a ritual procession by the coffin.<br>
    As they walk past, each one of them takes a hand-full<br>
    of DIRT and tosses it onto the coffin. Beverly stares<br>
    down at the grave...</p>
  <p>2 ANGLE ON COFFIN</p>
  <p> As a hand-full of dirt hits the coffin... then<br>
    another...</p>
  <p>3 BEVERLY</p>
  <p> Watches the coffin silently...</p>
  <p>4 ANGLE ON COFFIN</p>
  <p> As another pile of dirt hits... and another... and<br>
    suddenly a single FLOWER is thrown onto the coffin --<br>
    a CAMELLIA, bright against the dark wood.</p>
  <p>5 BEVERLY</p>
  <p> reacts, looks up to see --</p>
  <p>6 A MAN</p>
  <p> is staring directly at her. His eyes are intense, face<br>
    utterly expressionless -- he's striking and attractive<br>
    but somehow strange. His skin is very pale, delicate,<br>
    eyes a striking GREEN in contrast...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>7 BEVERLY</p>
  <p> reacts to the man, startled -- who is he? Before she<br>
    can say anything, the man walks past her... and the<br>
    procession of mourners continues. She glances back at<br>
    the man, trying to shake the odd feeling. OFF her<br>
    curious expression...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>8 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - CEMETERY - DAY</p>
  <p> A short time later. The funeral is over and many of<br>
    the mourners are slowly starting to leave, while others<br>
    have broken off into small groups, talking quietly.<br>
    Picard and Governor Maturin are standing off to one<br>
    side, mid-conversation.</p>
  <p> MATURIN<br>
    How long are you planning to stay?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Just a few more hours. Why?</p>
  <p> MATURIN<br>
    Well, as I'm sure you know, Caldos<br>
    was one of the first terraforming<br>
    projects of the Federation. Some<br>
    of our weather controls and fusion<br>
    systems are nearly a century old.<br>
    I wouldn't mind having a starship<br>
    Engineer take a look at them...<br>
    perhaps give us a few upgrades.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MATURIN (Cont'd)<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Maybe in exchange for a tour of<br>
    the colony... and a home-cooked<br>
    meal?</p>
  <p> Picard looks over at Beverly, who can be seen standing<br>
    by the graveside, receiving condolences from a couple<br>
    of mourners. He grows thoughtful...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're due at Starbase six-two-one<br>
    tomorrow morning... but we can<br>
    delay that for a few days. Yes...<br>
    I'm sure we can find some time.</p>
  <p> MATURIN<br>
    Excellent.</p>
  <p> A beat. Picard looks around at the peaceful setting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I look forward to that tour. The<br>
    Caldos Colony is really an<br>
    impressive accomplishment. I<br>
    actually feel like I'm in the<br>
    Scottish Highlands.</p>
  <p> MATURIN<br>
    That was the intent. The<br>
    cornerstone of every building in<br>
    town was brought from Edinburgh..<br>
    Glasgow... Aberdeen... The<br>
    founders wanted everyone to have<br>
    a piece of the real thing here.<br>
    They didn't just want to imitate<br>
    Scotland -- they wanted to<br>
    recreate it.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm curious, Governor... you're<br>
    obviously not from Scotland. What<br>
    drew you here?</p>
  <p> MATURIN<br>
    There's something about the<br>
    culture... the heritage. When I<br>
    was a boy, my family visited<br>
    Glamis Castle in Scotland. As I<br>
    looked out across the highlands,<br>
    I felt as if I'd come home.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>9 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Beverly is standing by the graveside, where TWO N.D.<br>
    COLONISTS are using old-fashioned shovels to fill in<br>
    the grave with dirt. A mourner hugs Beverly, then<br>
    walks off. A moment later Troi walks up and puts her<br>
    arm in Beverly's.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I thought it was a beautiful<br>
    eulogy, Beverly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks around at the departing mourners.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You know, I never realized how<br>
    many friends Nana had...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Did you come home often?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not really. After I married Jack<br>
    and moved to Earth... I never<br>
    seemed to get back here...</p>
  <p> Beverly looks intrigued by something.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Deanna... did you notice a<br>
    peculiar man at the service? He<br>
    looked like he was in his midthirties...<br>
    dark hair?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He threw a flower on Nana's<br>
    grave... a camellia... it was her<br>
    favorite flower. She used to keep<br>
    them all over the house.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Maybe he was a friend... or one of<br>
    her patients.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Maybe. It was just such a<br>
    personal gesture... and he gave me<br>
    the oddest look...</p>
  <p> A beat, then Beverly shakes the feeling.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well... I suppose I should go back<br>
    to the house. There are some<br>
    things there I'd like to take care<br>
    of.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It's only a few minutes away.<br>
    Would you mind coming along?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'd love to.</p>
  <p> As Beverly and Troi walk off...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>10 INT. HOWARD HOME - DAY</p>
  <p> A large, open living area. The LIVING ROOM is adjacent<br>
    to a SITTING ROOM... and there are doors to suggest<br>
    other rooms. There is a stairway leading up to an<br>
    offscreen second story. The decor should suggest an<br>
    earlier time and way of life -- a warm Scottish country<br>
    home from the early 19th century. Herbs and other<br>
    exotic-looking medicinal ARTIFACTS can be seen<br>
    throughout the house. And there are a few 24th century<br>
    devices in evidence -- a replicator, computer terminal,<br>
    etc.</p>
  <p> Troi is standing at a table, looking at an old-style<br>
    PHOTOGRAPH of Beverly standing next to an elderly<br>
    woman. Beverly is standing nearby, looking through<br>
    some belongings.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - ACT ONE 8A.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (re: photograph)<br>
    Your grandmother had remarkable<br>
    green eyes...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - ACT ONE 9-10. </p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Every woman in the Howard family<br>
    has had green eyes... except for<br>
    my mother and me.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How well do you remember your<br>
    mother?</p>
  <p> Beverly stops, remembering.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not very well... I was so young<br>
    when she died. I just have the<br>
    image of her face... and I can<br>
    hear the sound of her voice, but<br>
    I can't tell you anything specific<br>
    she ever said...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Mostly, I remember Nana.</p>
  <p> Beverly sees something in a corner and moves to it...<br>
    stops at an exotic-looking CANDLE -- it has an<br>
    elaborate metal base with engravings on it. The candle<br>
    FLAME is burning brightly. (NOTE: It is not a waxburning<br>
    candle -- it looks more like the kerosene<br>
    variety.)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (re: candle)<br>
    That's beautiful... what is it?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    A family heirloom... it's been in<br>
    the Howard clan for at least<br>
    twenty generations. It's supposed<br>
    to symbolize the &quot;enduring spirit<br>
    of the Howards, wherever they may<br>
    go -- a shining light to guide<br>
    their fortune.&quot;<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Nana always kept it lit. I can<br>
    remember sitting in here listening<br>
    to ghost stories with only this<br>
    candle burning...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You should take it with you...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I think I will.</p>
  <p> A quiet beat as they stare at the flame.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Well... I'm going to head back to<br>
    the ship.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You don't have to go.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Something tells me you'd like some<br>
    time alone.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I'll see you later.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Thanks.</p>
  <p> Troi EXITS. Beverly looks around for a long moment...<br>
    taking in the house... then she sits on a chair by the<br>
    fireplace and picks up a large leather-bound JOURNAL<br>
    sitting on a side-table with several other books. She<br>
    eyes it with curiosity, runs her fingers over the<br>
    cover, and opens it...</p>
  <p>10A INSERT - THE JOURNAL</p>
  <p> as she opens it to the first page, where the name<br>
    &quot;FELISA HOWARD&quot; is hand-written in ink. She turns to<br>
    a few more pages -- every page has a hand-written date<br>
    and journal entry on it...</p>
  <p>10B RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> Beverly begins to flip through the pages... intrigued<br>
    by what she reads. She stands, still turning the<br>
    pages, and walks up the staircase, disappearing out of<br>
    view...</p>
  <p>10C NEW ANGLE - THE ROOM</p>
  <p> After a silent beat, a NOISE is heard at the door --<br>
    the rattling of the lock. The door creaks open... and<br>
    a man steps into the house. It's NED QUINT -- a dour<br>
    man in his mid-fifties with a heavy Scottish accent.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - ACT ONE 11A.</p>
  <p>10C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He walks directly to the table where the exotic candle<br>
    is burning. He eyes it with an angry and unhappy<br>
    look... then blows out the flame and is about to throw<br>
    the candle to the floor--</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S VOICE<br>
    Who's there?</p>
  <p> Quint turns, surprised at the voice --</p>
  <p>11 INCLUDE BEVERLY</p>
  <p> as she comes down the staircase.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What the hell are you doing?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She rushes over to him, grabs the candle out of his<br>
    hands, angry.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Get out of my house.</p>
  <p> QUINT<br>
    I wouldn't get so high and mighty<br>
    with me, Beverly Howard Crusher.<br>
    I've spent more time here in the<br>
    past five years than you have in<br>
    the past twenty.</p>
  <p> She looks at him in surprise, taken aback.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How do you know who I am?</p>
  <p> QUINT<br>
    I'm Ned Quint. I took care of<br>
    your grandmother's house and her<br>
    affairs.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Nana never mentioned you...</p>
  <p> QUINT<br>
    There's a lot of things she didn't<br>
    tell you.</p>
  <p> Beat. Beverly examines the candle, calming down a<br>
    little. Quint eyes the candle with intent.</p>
  <p> QUINT<br>
    Now -- let me get rid of that<br>
    candle.</p>
  <p> Quint reaches out to take the candle from her, but she<br>
    pulls it away.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What do you mean?</p>
  <p> QUINT<br>
    That candle has brought nothing<br>
    but misery and bad luck to your<br>
    grandmother.</p>
  <p> Beverly's eyes flash and she stiffens slightly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Now listen, Mister Quint -- I<br>
    don't know what your relationship<br>
    was with my grandmother. But this<br>
    is my house now and these are my<br>
    things --</p>
  <p> QUINT<br>
    I'm telling ya -- that candle has<br>
    been a curse on your family for<br>
    generations. And if you had a<br>
    lick of sense, you'd listen to me<br>
    right now and do away with it.<br>
    Now give it to me.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (hard)<br>
    This is a family heirloom and I<br>
    intend to keep it. I would like<br>
    you to leave my house. Now.</p>

    I wash my hands of it now. You<br>
    stay in this house and keep that<br>
    damned candle and I won't be<br>
    responsible for what happens.</p>

    suggest you --</p>
  <p> Suddenly, a MIRROR on the far wall begins to RATTLE<br>
    slightly from an unseen source. Beverly looks over and<br>
    it immediately stops rattling. She moves to the<br>
    mirror, examines it closely... and then lifts the<br>
    mirror off the nail and looks behind it. Nothing<br>
    there. She replaces the mirror on the wall -- and as<br>
    she sets it into place, we suddenly see the image of<br>
    the YOUNG MAN from the funeral standing right behind<br>
    Beverly!</p>
  <p> Beverly drops the mirror in shock and whirls around.<br>
    There's a shattering CRASH as the mirror hits the<br>
    ground. But there's nobody there. Beverly is shaken,<br>
    angry.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing, calls out)<br>
    Alright... that's it. Whoever you<br>
    are, show yourself right now or<br>
    I'm going to call the Enterprise<br>
    and have ten security guards down<br>
    here in the next thirty seconds.</p>
  <p> A beat... then a flash of LIGHTNING lights up the room.<br>
    A quick beat later comes a roll of THUNDER -- and over<br>
    the thunder we hear a MAN'S VOICE -- low and<br>
    seductive... as heard in Beverly's dream in Act One.</p>
  <p> MAN'S VOICE<br>
    Beverly...</p>
  <p> She reacts -- was it the thunder, or was there really<br>
    a voice? She's not certain. She waits. Then the<br>
    voice comes again, this time without the thunder. (We<br>
    will later learn that the voice belongs to someone<br>
    named RONIN.)</p>
  <p> RONIN/MAN'S VOICE<br>
    Beverly... I've come back for<br>
    you...</p>
  <p> She looks around the room.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Who are you?</p>
  <p> RONIN'S VOICE<br>
    Don't you remember? I came to you<br>
    last night... while you were<br>
    asleep...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (firm)<br>
    No... that was a dream...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm calling the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> She pulls a combadge out of her pocket, but before she<br>
    can activate it her coat FALLS from her shoulders, as<br>
    if it were taken off. She takes in a breath, feeling<br>
    a rush of sensation and emotion. Her eyes lose focus<br>
    momentarily, as though she's just been given some kind<br>
    of narcotic.</p>
  <p> RONIN'S VOICE<br>
    Now do you remember me?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Her eyes flutter and she breathes heavily again, drawn<br>
    deep into the narcotic state. The combadge falls from<br>
    her hand onto the floor. Like someone coming out of a<br>
    deep sleep, she tries to force her eyes open...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes, but... what's happening to<br>
    me... I feel... strange...</p>
  <p> RONIN'S VOICE<br>
    I love you, Beverly... just as I<br>
    loved Felisa before you.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Are you... Ronin?</p>
  <p> RONIN'S VOICE<br>
    That's right... you saw me at the<br>
    funeral.</p>
  <p> She reacts to an unseen caress. Her expression turns<br>
    to a smile and she bites her lower lip, tensing. The<br>
    feeling should be very erotic and mesmerizing. Beverly<br>
    is now adrift... caught in the throes of the narcotic<br>
    effect. She starts to move around the house, searching<br>
    for the source of the voice... trying to keep her eyes<br>
    focused...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Who... are you?</p>
  <p> RONIN'S VOICE<br>
    I'm a spirit...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (weak)<br>
    But I don't believe in...</p>
  <p> RONIN'S VOICE<br>
    Ghosts? I don't blame you... I<br>
    didn't either at first. But I was<br>
    born in sixteen-forty-seven... in<br>
    Glasgow on Earth.</p>
  <p> Beverly is intrigued by this story, pulled in by it,<br>
    but also trying to maintain some semblance of her<br>
    Starfleet objectivity.</p>

  <p>29 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    So you're telling me that you're<br>
    an eight hundred year-old ghost...</p>
  <p> As the voice speaks, Beverly continues her search of<br>
    the house -- looking in every corner... behind every<br>
    door... but there's no one there...</p>
  <p> RONIN'S VOICE<br>
    That's right. I found a home with<br>
    Jessel Howard... she was a pretty<br>
    lass with a mane of red hair, and<br>
    eyes like diamonds... and I loved<br>
    her very much. And when she died,<br>
    I stayed with her daughter... and<br>
    her daughter... and on down<br>
    through the years, generation<br>
    after generation...</p>
  <p> Beverly is mesmerized by the voice... it's getting<br>
    harder and harder to maintain her composure. As Ronin<br>
    tells his story, she slowly begins to back away from an<br>
    unseen source, as though being gently forced<br>
    backward... and she collapses onto a couch, losing her<br>
    balance...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And now you're here... on<br>
    Caldos... two hundred light years<br>
    away?</p>
  <p> RONIN'S VOICE<br>
    Yes... When your family moved out<br>
    into the galaxy, I moved with<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't believe you...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Now her protest is so weak, they're just words.</p>
  <p> RONIN'S VOICE<br>
    I believe you are the most<br>
    beautiful women I have ever<br>
    known...</p>
  <p> Beverly's eyes close and her head rolls back, oblivious<br>
    to the world around her. She reacts again to an<br>
    invisible touch moving across her body... but before it<br>
    can go on she manages to sit up and fight against the<br>
    sensation.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Wait -- what's happening...</p>
  <p> RONIN'S VOICE<br>
    We're becoming one, Beverly...<br>
    we're going to be together...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't understand... stop...</p>
  <p> She sits up and the moment is broken. Silence.<br>
    Beverly rubs her eyes as if waking up from a long<br>
    night's sleep. She touches her face, as if remembering<br>
    a lover's caress. Her expression is thoughtful but not<br>
    frightened. OFF her intrigued look...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>30 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As before, in orbit of the planet -- but now the ship<br>
    is sending out a thin BEAM OF ENERGY through the<br>
    atmosphere below.</p>
  <p>31 INT. BEVERLY'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Beverly is sitting in front of a dresser, wearing a<br>
    loose-fitting robe. She's relaxing, arranging a<br>
    cluster of camellia flowers in front of a mirror. She<br>
    eyes the flowers a moment...</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES.</p>

  <p> Troi ENTERS, wearing her martial arts outfit.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Hi, Bev. I just wanted to see if<br>
    you were going to mok'bara class<br>
    this morning.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No... I think I'm going to skip it<br>
    today. I'm exhausted.</p>
  <p> Beverly moves to her bed and takes a glass of water off<br>
    the night table, takes a sip.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Did you have another dream last<br>
    night?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not exactly...</p>
  <p> Troi senses that Beverly is holding something back.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Is anything wrong?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not at all. I'm just a little<br>
    tired.</p>
  <p> Troi looks at her, sensing more -- and she reacts,<br>
    surprised by something.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Beverly... if I didn't know any<br>
    better, I'd say you're seeing<br>
    someone.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Deanna...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Oh, now I know you're seeing<br>
    someone.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Beverly hesitates -- she doesn't want to talk about<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm not... &quot;seeing&quot; anybody. I<br>
    met someone, that's all...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Well, you obviously have romantic<br>
    feelings for him...<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    Beverly, you should realize by now<br>
    you can't fool me. Who is it?</p>
  <p> Beverly pauses... then finally she smiles slightly --<br>
    she's been caught. She sits down on the bed and Troi<br>
    sits across from her.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Alright... the truth is, I met<br>
    Ronin.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Ronin? Your grandmother's lover?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I know, I know... it sounds crazy.<br>
    But he's unlike anyone I've ever<br>
    met before.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I've never known anyone who's<br>
    so... passionate. It's like he<br>
    brings every part of me alive.<br>
    He's very...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Sensual?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes. Exactly. I can see why Nana<br>
    fell in love with him...</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at Troi and laughs a little in<br>
    embarrassment.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You must think this is pretty<br>
    strange...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I will admit, it's unusual... but<br>
    I'm very happy for you.<br>

  <p>31 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I do want you to consider<br>
    something. You and Ronin have<br>
    both experienced a tremendous<br>
    loss. Very often a shared<br>
    traumatic experience can create<br>
    the illusion of closeness... and<br>
    romance.</p>
  <p> Beverly considers this, but she's unconcerned.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I appreciate the concern, but I<br>
    think I know what I'm doing.<br>
    Besides, I didn't say I was in<br>
    love with him. I'm just...<br>
    intrigued.</p>
  <p> Troi, for the moment, is satisfied with this. OFF<br>
    Beverly's enigmatic expression...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>32 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Picard and Governor Maturin, mid-conversation. Maturin<br>
    is wearing a RAIN PARKA, and he's wet from the recent<br>
    storm.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MATURIN<br>
    You know, Captain... I moved to<br>
    this colony because it was a<br>
    recreation of Scotland. But I<br>
    must admit, it's becoming a little<br>
    too realistic.</p>
  <p> Maturin sneezes. The Turbolift doors open and they<br>
    EXIT to the Bridge...</p>
  <p>33 INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Picard and Maturin stop at what they see. There is a<br>
    dense, low-hanging FOG everywhere on the Bridge. Worf<br>
    is frantically working his console. Data is on his<br>
    feet, scanning the fog with a tricorder. Picard and<br>
    Maturin walk to command.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    What the hell is going on?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Fog?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It just sort of... rolled in on<br>
    us, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf works his console.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    There has been a malfunction in<br>
    the ship's environmental controls.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've traced the problem to the<br>
    power transfer beam -- we're<br>
    getting some sort of feedback from<br>
    one of the colony's weather<br>
    substations.</p>
  <p> MATURIN<br>
    Another power fluctuation?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf reacts to his console.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain -- the temperature in Ten<br>
    Forward has dropped below<br>
    freezing... and Deck Nineteen has<br>
    just lost gravity.</p>
  <p> Reactions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data -- disengage the power<br>
    transfer.</p>
  <p> Data sits at Ops and works.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am unable to terminate the<br>
    connection, sir. A feedback loop<br>
    has formed in the transfer beam.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I will have to go to the<br>
    substation and attempt to correct<br>
    the problem from there.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> Data heads for the door. Picard shivers slightly,<br>
    reacting to a chill in the air.</p>

  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>34 INT. WEATHER CONTROL STATION</p>
  <p> A small room lined with consoles and monitors that<br>
    display various weather-tracking information. Many of<br>

  <p> Without warning, a bright FLASH OF GREEN PLASMA ENERGY<br>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>36 INT. WEATHER CONTROL STATION</p>
  <p> Later. Data and Geordi are working at the panel where<br>
    Quint was ripping out components. Maturin is looking<br>
    on. Beverly is in the b.g., kneeling next to Quint's<br>
    body, scanning it with a tricorder (she's in uniform,<br>
    wearing her lab coat). A MEDICAL N.D. is assisting<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    From what I can tell, he was<br>
    trying to shut down the entire<br>

    (beat)<br>
    He was pulling out the primary<br>
    plasma conduit... that's probably<br>
    what caused the plasma discharge<br>
    that killed him.</p>
  <p> Maturin shakes his head, baffled by all this.</p>
  <p> MATURIN<br>
    I knew Ned Quint. He was an<br>
    honest man... he mostly kept to<br>
    himself. I can't imagine why he<br>
    would do something like this...</p>

  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> A grim beat.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It'll take some time to get the<br>
    system back on-line... I'd say we<br>
    need another day, at least.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In the meantime, Governor, you<br>
    should expect the weather problems<br>
    to continue.</p>
  <p> Maturin nods, then --</p>

    looks up in puzzlement.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Anything?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I cannot identify the energy<br>
    residual. However, it appears to<br>

    as the power fluctuations we<br>
    observed in the weather control<br>

  <p> RONIN'S VOICE<br>
    I know. Quint is dead.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Do you know what happened? What<br>
    was he trying to do?</p>
  <p> RONIN'S VOICE<br>
    Beverly... there's something more<br>
    important we have to talk about...</p>
  <p> Beverly closes her eyes, struggles to concentrate on<br>
    the problem at hand...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Ronin... I've got to know.<br>
    Quint's dead...</p>
  <p> Suddenly, a HAND reaches into frame and cups her cheek.<br>
    Beverly reacts in surprise, turns --</p>

  <p>39 REVEAL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> RONIN. It's the man from the funeral. He staring at<br>
    Beverly with an intense look.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Ronin?</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> Ronin reaches out for her. She puts her hands into<br>
    his. He draws her close. The sight of him is almost<br>
    hypnotic to Beverly -- she seems drawn to him by<br>
    feelings and forces that she cannot understand or<br>
    resist.</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    I need you to help me...</p>
  <p> He steers her to a couch and they both sit down. Ronin<br>
    shudders for a moment, reacting to a sudden pain<br>
    throughout his body.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Help you?</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    It's not easy for me to take<br>
    corporeal form... I can't do it<br>
    for long. I want you to light the<br>
    candle...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Quint said it was your home... is<br>
    that true?</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    Yes... if I'm away from it for too<br>
    long, I begin to weaken. That's<br>
    why the women in your family have<br>
    always kept the candle lit.</p>
  <p> Ronin shivers briefly, in pain. Beverly stands,<br>
    worried.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The candle is on my ship... I'll<br>
    go get it...</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    No... there's no time... I'll go<br>
    with you...</p>

  <p> RONIN<br>
    The power transfer beam... I can<br>
    travel along it.</p>
  <p> Beverly nods, eager to help him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    After I light the candle, then<br>
    what?</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    Then we'll be together... always.</p>
  <p> He takes her in his arms... and he kisses her. But<br>
    before it can turn passionate, he stands and backs<br>
    away... and he VANISHES, leaving her unsatisfied.</p>

  <p>39 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> In her eyes, we can see that she has completely<br>
    forgotten about Quint and is only concerned with what<br>
    Ronin has told her. As she stands and heads for the<br>
    door...</p>

  <p> Beverly ENTERS.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Computer, secure door.</p>
  <p> She immediately goes to a desk and quickly sorts<br>
    through a medical kit with an obsessive, almost<br>
    maniacal drive. She finds a laser DEVICE... then she<br>
    quickly moves to the candle on her night table and<br>
    LIGHTS it. She sits down on the bed and looks around<br>
    the room expectantly. She is obviously on edge --<br>
    nervous, doesn't know what to do with her hands. After<br>
    a beat, she gets up, walks around the room, keeps<br>
    glancing at the candle. Beverly is like a drug addict<br>
    in search of her next &quot;fix&quot;.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing, calls out)<br>
    I lit the candle... where are you?</p>
  <p> She sits on the edge of the bed, puts her head in her<br>
    trembling hands and tries to get a hold of herself.<br>
    Suddenly, from behind her, a PAIR OF HANDS reaches over<br>
    her shoulders and caresses her hands. Beverly grabs<br>
    the man's hands and holds onto them tightly, hanging on<br>
    for dear life. Ronin moves into view, comforting...</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    It's all right... we're<br>
    together... we're going to be<br>
    one... I'll become part of you,<br>
    Beverly. Would you like that?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes... more than anything.</p>
  <p> Ronin looks pleased. His breathing is still labored...</p>

    them... I'll take care of you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And you'll feel love as you've<br>
    never felt it before...</p>
  <p> He smiles at her. We can see that in this moment there<br>
    is nothing Beverly wouldn't do for this man. He walks<br>
    toward her with intent and VANISHES. Beverly's arms<br>
    close around nothing... she is feeling an unseen<br>
    presence. She runs her hands her across her face...<br>
    neck... caressing herself... runs her fingers across<br>
    her lips... as if still feeling his lips upon hers...</p>
  <p> She falls backward onto the bed. As she is swept away<br>

    PADD.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (re: PADD)<br>
    Beverly... what the hell is this?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I thought it was pretty self-explanatory.<br>
    I'm leaving<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can -- and I have. I've decided<br>

    a proud Howard tradition, and I've<br>
    decided to uphold it.<br>

  <p> Picard and Troi, mid-conversation. Picard is on his<br>
    feet, tense. They're trying to make sense of the<br>
    situation.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Beverly was attracted to Ronin in<br>
    a very... intense and intimate<br>
    way. I warned her that they had<br>
    both experienced a recent loss...<br>
    but she seemed very defensive<br>
    about it... so I left her alone.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I could sense she was holding<br>
    something back... she wasn't<br>
    telling me the whole truth...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you think this Ronin may be<br>
    exerting some sort of influence on<br>
    her... that she may be staying<br>
    because of him?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's possible. She may really<br>
    believe she's in love...</p>
  <p> Picard considers -- something still doesn't seem right<br>
    about all this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's a rash decision... ill-considered...<br>
    not like Beverly at<br>
    all.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    I agree. But she does have the<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Data ENTERS.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, Geordi and I have<br>

    the same anaphasic signature as<br>
    the one we found in Ned Quint's<br>
    body.</p>

    Where?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Approximately seventeen kilometers<br>
    from the center of the colony.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It is coming from the cemetery,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts to the strange news.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I want you to go down to the<br>
    cemetery... see if you can<br>
    pinpoint the source.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> Data EXITS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    The energy readings are coming<br>
    from this area, but I can't get an<br>
    exact location. I'll try to<br>
    narrow the scan field...</p>
  <p> Geordi adjusts his tricorder, then walks into the<br>
    cemetery with no hesitation. Data follows. They walk<br>
    among the tombstones moment, scanning. Data reacts to<br>
    his tricorder... aims it toward the ground.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The energy readings appear to be<br>

    And it will only get better.</p>
  <p> He strokes her cheek, then stands and takes a step<br>
    away. His body TRANSFORMS into an irridescent GREEN<br>
    MIST. Beverly stares in anticipation as the vaporous<br>
    shape moves toward her... her body tense but open to<br>
    receive it. The vapor CLINGS to the contours of her<br>
    face and body... and then it COALESCES into her,<br>
    LIGHTING UP her features with a momentary GLOW...</p>
  <p> Beverly's eyes close... her head rolls about on her<br>
    shoulders... she's in the throes of some dark and<br>
    mysterious passion...</p>

  <p> her eyes still closed...</p>

    I love you, Beverly.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, there's a KNOCK at the door. Beverly ignores<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Ronin)<br>
    I love you...</p>
  <p> There's a more insistent knock at the door. Beverly<br>
    still ignores it. We hear the door open...</p>

  <p> Beverly sits up at the voice, and there is a sense that<br>
    she has awakened from a deep sleep. She sees Picard<br>
    and pulls the robe tightly around her and gets to her<br>
    feet. She's surprised to see him -- and a little<br>
    embarrassed.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry for startling you. I<br>
    knocked, but there was no answer.</p>
  <p> Beverly is agitated, tense.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (on edge)<br>
    What do you want?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hoped to meet your new friend...<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He's... not here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh. Well, if you don't mind I'll<br>
    wait. I'm anxious to meet this<br>
    remarkable young man who swept<br>
    away not only one, but two of the<br>
    Howard women.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (an edge)<br>
    Jealousy doesn't become you, Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> Picard ignores the barb... and notices something.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Beverly... did you change the<br>
    color of your eyes?</p>
  <p> Beverly takes a couple steps away from him,<br>
    thoughtful... glances into a nearby mirror. She reacts<br>
    in surprise... tries to keep her voice matter of fact.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes... I just got tired of the old<br>
    color. Don't you think this suits<br>
    me?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think I liked your eyes the way<br>
    they were before...<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well, this is the way I am now.<br>
    This is my life. I've made my<br>
    decision and I'm not going to<br>
    change my mind, so please leave me<br>
    alone.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No... there's something's wrong<br>
    here. This is about more than<br>
    just an obsessive love affair<br>
    that's gotten out of hand...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Why is it that no one has seen<br>
    this Ronin except you?</p>
  <p> RONIN VOICE<br>
    Alright, Captain. Here I am.</p>
  <p> They both turn in surprise, and there standing on the<br>
    other side of the room is Ronin. Beverly moves to him,<br>
    as if everything were normal. She takes his arm.</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    And I believe Beverly asked you to<br>
    leave.</p>
  <p> Picard side-steps the issue of leaving and tries to get<br>
    to the bottom of this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So, you're Ronin... it's a<br>
    pleasure to meet you. Where are<br>
    you from?</p>

    now. And that Beverly and I plan<br>
    to be together for the rest our<br>
    lives.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's a very... romantic notion.<br>
    Especially for two people who have<br>
    just met. Don't you think perhaps<br>
    you're rushing into things a bit?</p>
  <p> Ronin's expression hardens.</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    I think you're a jealous man who<br>

    You can't do that. Leave her<br>
    alone...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why? What are you afraid of?</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    I'm not afraid of anything. But<br>
    I won't let you desecrate her<br>

  <p> Picard takes a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Mister Data, contact Governor<br>
    Maturin and ask for permission to<br>
    exhume the body. Picard out.</p>
  <p> Ronin takes an angry step toward him.</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    I won't stand for this... I'll go<br>
    to the governor myself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go ahead. But I'll be surprised<br>
    if the governor knows who you are.<br>
    He'll probably have the same<br>
    questions I do. How did you come<br>
    to Caldos? What ship did you<br>
    arrive on?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    ship? I'd like to look at the<br>
    passenger list.<br>
    (pressing on)<br>
    Where have you been living here on<br>
    Caldos? What's your position<br>
    here? Who are your neighbors?</p>
  <p> Ronin's eyes flash in anger and he VANISHES. Picard<br>
    reacts.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing, quickly)<br>
    Come on, Beverly -- we have to get<br>
    out of here.</p>
  <p> He reaches for her hand to pull her away -- but a BURST<br>
    OF THE GREEN PLASMA ENERGY snakes around his body out<br>
    of thin-air. He falls to his knees, then slumps to the<br>
    floor. Beverly reacts -- the shock of seeing Picard<br>
    hurt seems to propel her into action. She rushes to<br>
    his side, instinctively helping her friend.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jean-Luc...</p>
  <p> She feels for a pulse, then grabs a medical kit from a<br>
    nearby table, brings it over and starts to administer<br>
    aid to him.</p>

    Beverly's shoulder...</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    Beverly... come with me.</p>
  <p> She looks up into his face... her expression<br>
    stricken... she's like an addict taking the first step<br>
    away from a powerful drug. It's one of the most<br>
    difficult things she's ever had to do.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No... no!</p>
  <p> She pushes him away and goes to work on Picard. Ronin<br>
    eyes her -- worried, fearful, angry. Then a look of<br>
    resolve crosses his face.</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    I'm going to stop them.</p>
  <p> Ronin steps away and we HEAR him vanish offscreen.</p>
  <p> As soon as he's gone, Beverly suddenly sags, as if<br>
    exhausted. She puts a hand to her forehead, closes her<br>
    eyes, fights off a wave of nausea... she struggles to<br>
    open her eyes and focus on the tricorder -- and when<br>
    she does, we see that her EYES have turned BLUE again --<br>
    her normal color. She concentrates on Picard... scans<br>
    him with the tricorder...</p>
  <p> After a moment, Picard regains consciousness... he<br>
    looks up at her...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm alright...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Beverly... you must go after<br>
    him... go to the cemetery...</p>
  <p> Beverly nods. OFF her concern...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>50 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - CEMETERY - NIGHT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As before. Data and Geordi standing next to Felisa<br>
    Howard's grave.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (taps combadge)<br>
    La Forge to Enterprise -- we're<br>
    ready down here.</p>
  <p> A beat, then we see a COFFIN MATERIALIZE on top of the<br>
    grave. (Same coffin seen in Teaser.) Data and Geordi<br>
    walk to the coffin and pull out their tricorders.</p>
  <p> Data releases two LATCHES on the coffin and LIFTS OPEN<br>
    the coffin lid. We see the DEAD BODY of FELISA HOWARD,<br>
    lying peacefully in the coffin. Geordi and Data begin<br>
    to scan her body.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    I am reading definite signs of<br>
    anaphasic energy in her body -- it<br>
    appears to extend to the cellular<br>
    level.</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts, keeps scanning.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    How's that possible? She wasn't<br>
    anywhere near the weather station<br>
    when Quint was killed... she died<br>
    of natural causes...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I suggest we run a deep tissue<br>
    scan to look for --</p>
  <p> Suddenly, Felisa's eyes OPEN -- she's staring directly<br>
    at Data. Data reacts with surprise. Felisa SITS UP,<br>
    reaches out and GRABS Data and Geordi by the arms.<br>
    They are suddenly enveloped in a field of CRACKLING<br>
    GREEN PLASMA ENERGY -- as seen before. Data slumps<br>
    over at the waist, deactivated. Geordi falls to his<br>
    knees and slumps to the ground.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; REV. 11/08/93 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Geordi moans, dazed... lying on the ground... he tries<br>
    to sit up. Felisa starts to get out of the coffin,<br>
    eyeing Geordi with intent -- a bizarre and terrifying<br>
    sight...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S VOICE<br>
    Stop -- NO!</p>
  <p>51 INCLUDE BEVERLY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> who stares at the shocking sight of her dead<br>
    grandmother getting out of her coffin.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Ronin -- stop this... please...</p>
  <p> Felisa looks at Beverly.</p>
  <p> FELISA<br>
    Beverly, it's all right... have<br>
    trust in me..</p>
  <p> Beverly steels herself against the image of her<br>
    grandmother... she has broken the narcotic hold and is<br>
    struggling to be herself. She looks haggard,<br>
    exhausted.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (angry)<br>
    You're not Nana... Nana's dead.<br>
    Leave her alone.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, Felisa's body goes limp in the coffin. Ronin<br>
    APPEARS standing next to the grave.</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    Beverly, these men were trying to<br>
    stop us from being together. Once<br>
    they're gone, everything will be<br>
    all right.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No... I won't let you hurt my<br>
    friends.</p>
  <p> Beverly reveals that she is holding the exotic candle,<br>
    which is still lit.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; REV. 11/08/93 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>51 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No, it won't. I scanned myself<br>
    with the tricorder. You've been<br>
    infusing me with the same<br>
    anaphasic energy that killed<br>
    Quint...</p>
  <p> Ronin hesitates at this, troubled -- then he continues<br>
    to move toward her, his eyes boring into hers.</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    He was trying to destroy me... I<br>
    had to defend myself...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I would never hurt you,<br>
    Beverly. I'm here to protect<br>
    you...</p>
  <p> Beverly struggles to stay focused... confronting him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No, you're not. There's no such<br>
    thing as a ghost... you're some<br>
    sort of... anaphasic lifeform...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Anaphasic energy is extremely<br>
    unstable... without an organic<br>
    host to maintain your molecular<br>
    cohesion, you'd die... isn't that<br>
    right?</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    Beverly...</p>
  <p> Beverly indicates the candle.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; REV. 11/08/93 - ACT FIVE 60A.</p>
  <p>51 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (pressing on)<br>
    I scanned the candle, too... the<br>
    flame is plasma-based... you were<br>
    using it as a temporary receptacle<br>
    for yourself... until you could<br>
    get to me... so you could &quot;merge&quot;<br>
    with me...</p>
  <p> Ronin keeps coming, a threat. Beverly uses her words<br>
    to keep him at bay...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You've been using me... Nana... my<br>
    whole family... for centuries...</p>
  <p> Ronin's face darkens -- he knows he's been caught.</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    And I loved all of them... and<br>
    they loved me.<br>
    (firm)<br>
    Give me the candle, Beverly.</p>
  <p> He approaches her, reaching out for the candle.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> She steps backward. Ronin glances at Geordi, who is<br>
    still lying on the ground, dazed. Suddenly we see a<br>
    BURST of CRACKLING PLASMA ENERGY flash around Geordi,<br>
    who yells out in pain.</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    (re: Geordi)<br>
    Put it down -- or I'll kill him.</p>
  <p> Beverly watches in horror for a moment... then slowly<br>
    walks toward Ronin and Geordi...</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Very good... now set it down...<br>
    then walk way.</p>
  <p> Beverly sets the candle down near Ronin's feet... and<br>
    begins to stand up... but in a lightning move she GRABS<br>
    Geordi's phaser off his belt -- and she shoots it at<br>
    the candle, VAPORIZING it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - ACT FIVE 60B.</p>
  <p>51 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    NO!</p>
  <p> Beverly taps Geordi's communicator.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (quickly, to com)<br>
    Crusher to Riker. Wil -- I want<br>
    you to shut down all plasma<br>
    conduits in the weather control<br>
    system. I'll explain later.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Understood.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Ronin)<br>
    You've got nowhere left to go...</p>
  <p> Ronin smiles slightly, menacing.</p>
  <p> RONIN<br>
    Yes, I do...</p>
  <p> He moves toward Beverly with intent. Beverly aims the<br>
    phaser at him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Keep away from me...</p>
  <p> Ronin keeps coming, a threat. Beverly has no choice --<br>
    she FIRES at Ronin. He stumbles backward, quickly<br>
    recovers -- and he makes a sudden lunge toward her.<br>
    Beverly FIRES a sustained burst. Ronin's body begins<br>
    to FRITZ OUT, and he VANISHES in a final FLASH of<br>
    ENERGY. Gone.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; REV. 11/09/93 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>51 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Beverly quickly moves to Geordi, who nods that he's all<br>
    right. Beverly quickly moves to Data, reaches behind<br>
    his back and RE-ACTIVATES him. Data stands up -- he's<br>
    all right. Off Beverly's relief...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>52 OMITTED</p>
  <p>53 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse.</p>
  <p>54 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Later. Beverly and Troi are sitting at a remote table,<br>
    enjoying a drink.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Somehow he realized that one of my<br>
    ancestors had a biochemistry that<br>
    was compatible with his energy<br>
    matrix...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I imagine he took human form and<br>
    seduced her the same way he did<br>
    me. He had some sort of<br>
    hypnotic... almost telepathic<br>
    control.</p>
  <p> A somber beat as Beverly takes a sip of her drink.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's strange... I was about to be<br>
    initiated into a very unusual<br>
    relationship... I guess you could<br>
    call it a family tradition. And<br>
    there's a part of me that's a<br>
    little sad...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How so?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I re-read the entries in my<br>
    grandmother's journals. Whatever<br>
    else he might have done... he made<br>
    her very happy.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Sub Rosa&quot; - 11/05/93 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>54 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> As Beverly looks out the window, reflecting on her<br>
    experience...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
