    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> The room is bustling with activity -- it's one of those<br>
    days in Sickbay. RIKER is lying face-down on a biobed,<br>
    and OGAWA is very carefully removing some long,<br>
    nasty-looking THISTLES that are sticking out of his<br>
    back.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    So why were you rolling around in<br>
    Cypirion cactus?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you know Rebecca White?</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    The new Tactical officer...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nods)<br>
    We went for a walk in the<br>
    Arboretum... we sat down... got<br>
    comfortable... things got a<br>
    little romantic...</p>
  <p> Riker winces as Ogawa removes another thistle.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Then I rolled over.</p>
  <p>2 MOVE TO BEVERLY</p>
  <p> who is scanning BARCLAY with a medical tricorder.<br>
    Barclay is sitting on a bio-bed with a worried<br>
    expression. Mid-conversation.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Blurred vision... dizziness...<br>
    palpitations... a stinging<br>
    sensation in the lower spine...<br>
    it's Terrelian Death Syndrome,<br>
    isn't it?</p>
  <p> Beverly glances at him -- she's used to Barclay's<br>
    hypochondria.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I thought we agreed you'd come to<br>
    me before checking the Starfleet<br>
    Medical Database.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Yeah, well.. this time I'm glad I<br>
    did... maybe we've caught the<br>
    cellular decay before it's too<br>
    late.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Reg. You don't have Terrelian<br>
    Death Syndrome.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    You... you're sure?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm sure.</p>
  <p> A beat as Barclay thinks about this.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Then I guess it must be...<br>
    Symbalene blood burn.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No, no... I don't see anything<br>
    wrong with you at all...</p>
  <p> Barclay seems a little disappointed by the news.<br>
    Beverly reacts to her tricorder.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing, off<br>
    tricorder)<br>
    Wait a minute... there is a slight<br>
    imbalance in your K-three cell<br>
    count.</p>
  <p> Barclay pales.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    My K-threes... oh, no...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Barclay... I'm sure it's nothing.<br>
    Let me run a micro-cellular<br>
    scan...</p>
  <p> Beverly activates a MEDICAL DEVICE sitting a table next<br>
    to the bio-bed, which LIGHTS UP and begins to run a<br>
    test.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    This will take a couple of<br>
    minutes.</p>
  <p> She moves off. Barclay leans over and stares intensely<br>
    at the blinking lights...</p>
  <p>3 FOLLOW BEVERLY</p>
  <p> as she passes by a Medical N.D. who is working on<br>
    another patient. She checks progress on the patient...<br>
    nods her approval... then moves over to Riker and<br>
    Ogawa. Riker is still on his stomach, Ogawa removing<br>
    the last remaining thistles.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (with humor, re:<br>
    thistles)<br>
    You should leave a couple of those<br>
    in... just to teach him a lesson.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (wry)<br>
    Charming bedside manner...</p>
  <p> DATA ENTERS carrying a cat bed with SPOT in it (NOTE:<br>
    Spot should appear to be very PREGNANT). Data sets the<br>
    basket down on a bio-bed. Beverly moves to him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (re: Spot)<br>
    How's my smallest patient doing?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe she is doing well. Her<br>
    appetite has increased by seven<br>
    percent, and she is starting to<br>
    engage in pre-natal behavior.</p>
  <p> Beverly gently feels Spots belly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    She's getting close. You'll have<br>
    a fresh litter of hungry kittens<br>
    before the week is over. Let me<br>
    run an amniotic scan, just to make<br>
    sure everything's fine... and then --</p>
  <p> BARCLAY (O.S.)<br>
    Doctor -- my capillaries are<br>
    shrinking!</p>
  <p> Beverly sighs, turns to Ogawa.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Alissa, could you take care of<br>
    Spot for a minute? Start a<br>
    preliminary amniotic scan...</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Yes, Doctor.</p>
  <p> FOLLOW Beverly as she moves to Barclay, who is<br>
    anxiously staring at the blinking medical device.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    My intravascular pressure -- it's<br>
    ... it's gone right through the<br>
    roof.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're right... it's elevated.<br>
    You've also got heightened<br>
    electrophoretic activity.</p>
  <p> Barclay reacts.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (doomed)<br>
    Electrophoretic activity... is it<br>
    serious?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well... based on this, I'd say<br>
    you've got...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Seventy... maybe eighty years.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Eighty years!<br>
    (realizes)<br>
    Eighty years?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes, Reg. What you have is a mild<br>
    case of Urodelan Flu. It's<br>
    nothing serious. Most humans have<br>
    a natural immunity to it... but it<br>
    looks like the T-cell in your DNA<br>
    that would normally fight off this<br>
    infection is dormant.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    So I have... bad genes?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You have one dormant gene out of<br>
    a hundred thousand, and I can<br>
    activate that gene with a<br>
    synthetic T-cell -- let your body<br>
    attack the infection naturally.</p>
  <p> Beverly picks up a hypospray and adjusts it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You should be fine in a couple of<br>
    days.</p>
  <p> She injects him with the hypospray. Barclay looks<br>
    greatly relieved -- a new man.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Thank you, Doctor. I... I feel<br>
    much better now.</p>
  <p> In the b.g., Riker gets off the bio-bed, fully dressed.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Good. Now stay away from that<br>
    Medical Database...<br>
    (calls to Riker)<br>
    And you stay out of the Arboretum.</p>
  <p> Riker smiles. Barclay and Riker both EXIT. Beverly<br>
    moves back to Data and Ogawa, who are examining Spot.<br>
    Ogawa is scanning the cat with a tricorder.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Everything looks fine, Data. You<br>
    want to know the sex of the<br>
    kittens?</p>
  <p> Data thinks for a moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have noticed that many humans<br>
    prefer not to know in order to<br>
    experience the surprise during<br>
    birth. I believe I will preserve<br>
    the mystery until then.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    (casual)<br>
    I know what you mean... I don't<br>
    want to know either.</p>
  <p> Beverly and Data give her a look. Ogawa's smile<br>
    broadens.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Alissa... ?</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Spot's not the only one who's<br>
    going to be a mother.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Alissa, that's wonderful!</p>
  <p> Beverly hugs Ogawa, genuinely pleased.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How did Andrew take the news?</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    He was a little shocked... but<br>
    he's getting over it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Ogawa, re: Spot)<br>
    I have spent the past nine weeks<br>
    as an expectant parent. I would<br>
    be happy to share my insights with<br>
    your husband.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If my experience is any indication --<br>
    he will need all the help he can<br>
    get.</p>
  <p> As Beverly and Ogawa exchange a smile...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>4 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> holding position just outside an ASTEROID FIELD (as<br>
    seen in &quot;Booby Trap&quot;).</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 47653.2.<br>
    We are performing field tests of<br>
    our new tactical systems and<br>
    weapon upgrades. Mister Worf is<br>
    supervising the exercises.</p>
  <p>5 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD, RIKER, Data, WORF and ENSIGN DERN at their<br>
    stations. Worf is enjoying himself immensely -- he's<br>
    in his element. Picard, on the other hand, seems a<br>
    little bored.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Our next test will involve the new<br>
    photon torpedoes. The explosive<br>
    yield has been increased by eleven<br>
    percent... and I have enhanced the<br>
    targeting systems for increased<br>
    accuracy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sounds fascinating, Mister Worf.<br>
    Please proceed.</p>
  <p> Worf smiles slightly and works the console.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (with relish)<br>
    Setting targeting coordinates to<br>
    zero-zero-five mark three-one-seven...<br>
    spread pattern delta<br>
    nine-four...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Torpedoes armed and loaded.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Fire when ready.</p>
  <p> Worf takes a moment, then hits a control with<br>
    enthusiasm and watches the viewscreen...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>6 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it FIRES THREE TORPEDOES at the asteroid field. Two<br>
    of the torpedoes find their targets -- two asteroids<br>
    are VAPORIZED in a spectacular BLAST of fiery debris.<br>
    But the third torpedo VEERS AWAY and flies off into<br>
    space, disappearing in a crazy trail off into the<br>
    distance...</p>
  <p>7 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As before. Reactions to the sight.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (working)<br>
    One of the torpedoes has veered<br>
    off course. It appears to be a<br>
    malfunction in the guidance<br>
    system.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Abort and destroy.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (works)<br>
    Torpedo is not responding... the<br>
    subspace detonator will not<br>
    engage.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lock phasers...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The torpedo is out of range.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Even with your new, improved<br>
    phasers?</p>
  <p> Worf shoots him a look.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Maintain a sensor lock on the<br>
    torpedo -- we'll have to go after<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That would be inadvisable, sir.<br>
    The asteroid field is unusually<br>
    dense -- the Enterprise is too<br>
    large to navigate through it<br>
    safely.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard thinks, gets a better idea -- he's looking for<br>
    an excuse to leave.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then I'll take a shuttlecraft to<br>
    retrieve it.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Mister Data, you're with me.</p>
  <p> Picard heads for the door.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain -- the shuttle pilot on<br>
    duty is Lieutenant Hayes...</p>
  <p> Picard turns to him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I happen to be a reasonably<br>
    qualified pilot, Number One.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Besides, these... tests hardly<br>
    require the Captain's personal<br>
    attention.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Understood. Enjoy yourself, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (on the move)<br>
    In the meantime, Mister Worf --<br>
    you should consider analyzing your<br>
    new guidance system.</p>
  <p> Worf looks frustrated. Picard and Data head for the<br>
    door...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Picard, on the move)<br>
    Captain, I will need a few minutes<br>
    to take care of some personal<br>
    affairs.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard nods and they EXIT...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>8 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Data and Barclay are staring down at the bed, where<br>
    Spot is lying down. Barclay looks surprised.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Me?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    It is possible that it will take<br>
    several days for Captain Picard<br>
    and me to complete our mission.<br>
    I would prefer to have a human<br>
    present to supervise the birthing<br>
    process.</p>
  <p> Barclay sits on the bed and begins to pet Spot,<br>
    affectionate -- he's very comfortable with the animal.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Well... I'd be honored...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have noticed that you are the<br>
    only other member of the crew whom<br>
    Spot seems to like.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Really? I find that hard to<br>
    believe. She's such a sweet<br>
    little kitty...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    She is to you. However there have<br>
    been several... injuries when<br>
    other crewmembers have attempted<br>
    to care for her.</p>
  <p> Barclay glances around the room.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    So... has she picked the place?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The... &quot;place&quot;?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Cats usually like to pick out a<br>
    specific location to give birth...</p>
  <p> Barclay gets up and starts to looks around the room.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It's usually someplace dark... and<br>
    secluded...</p>
  <p> He stops at a chair and peers around it.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'll bet this is it.</p>
  <p> Data joins him and looks behind the chair. Lying on<br>
    the floor are a couple of CAT TOYS and a ball of<br>
    string. Data looks intrigued.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm curious, Data. Who's the<br>
    father?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am not certain. Spot has<br>
    escaped from my quarters on<br>
    several occasions. And there are<br>
    twelve male felines on board.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I intend to run a full DNA<br>

  <p> Data bends down and gives Spot a little kiss.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    Goodbye, Spot. I believe you are<br>
    in... good hands.</p>
  <p> Barclay smiles. Data heads for the door...</p>

  <p> Later. Riker, Ensign Dern and N.D.s at their<br>
    positions. Worf is working at the aft science station,<br>
    looking agitated. He taps a few controls, then slams<br>
    his fist down on the console in aggravation. Riker<br>
    walks up behind him, leans in close.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Problem?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (an edge)<br>
    I have performed thirteen<br>
    diagnostics of the weapons array,<br>
    and I can find nothing wrong with<br>
    the guidance system.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll have Geordi run a diagnostic<br>
    of the torpedo bay itself... maybe<br>
    he can find something.</p>
  <p> Worf glances at him, irritated.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (snaps)<br>
    Must you to stand so close to me?</p>
  <p> Riker reacts, a little taken aback.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lieutenant... are you alright?</p>
  <p> Worf is on edge, and it shows.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am... fine, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, you're not. You've been<br>
    working for the past six hours.<br>
    You're tired. Take a break.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But sir --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's an order, Worf.</p>
  <p> A beat, then Worf stands and heads for the door. OFF<br>
    Riker's concern...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>11 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> CLOSE ON Worf, who is sitting alone at a table, eating<br>
    from several plates FILLED with exotic-looking MEATS<br>
    and other strange-looking FOOD. He eats hungrily,<br>
    quickly, tearing into the meat with Klingon vigor.<br>
    There is an almost feral quality to his behavior -- a<br>
    subtle but growing change in his personality...</p>
  <p> TROI (O.S.)<br>
    Thanks for waiting.</p>
  <p> Worf jumps slightly, startled. He turns to see TROI<br>
    standing behind him. She is dressed in casual<br>
    clothing, and is carrying a glass of water.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Do not approach me unannounced --<br>
    especially while I am eating.</p>
  <p> He turns back to his food. Troi raises an eyebrow --<br>
    what's wrong with him?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf... we were supposed to have<br>
    lunch together, remember?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I was hungry.</p>
  <p> Troi sits down and eyes his food.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Well, I'm hungry too...</p>
  <p> Troi gets the attention of a passing WAITER.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing, to waiter)<br>
    Bring me an order of... Ongilin<br>
    caviar. Make that a double order.</p>
  <p> The waiter nods and moves off.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Caviar... for lunch?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm in the mood for something<br>
    salty. Besides, it's no stranger<br>
    than what you're eating.</p>
  <p> Worf grunts a little and keeps eating. Troi takes a<br>
    long drink from the glass of water... then rubs her<br>
    arms, uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Have you noticed how dry the air<br>
    is on the ship? I wonder if the<br>
    environmental controls are set<br>
    properly....</p>
  <p> Worf lets out a BELCH.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing, reacts)<br>
    You're excused.</p>
  <p> He ignores her. The waiter brings over two plates of<br>
    CAVIAR -- sets them on the table and moves off. Worf<br>
    glances up at Troi, licking some of the food off his<br>
    fingers... and he looks her up and down with a<br>
    predatory gleam in his eye. Troi is about to eat when<br>
    she senses something and looks up at him. She reacts<br>
    to what is clearly a sexually suggestive look on his<br>
    face.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Is something wrong?</p>
  <p> Worf looks back down at his food, a little embarrassed.<br>
    He changes the subject.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It has been a difficult day. The<br>
    torpedo guidance system failed...<br>
    it was my fault.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You always say that, Worf...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (a little too loud)<br>
    It was my fault. I designed the<br>
    guidance system.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf... calm down.</p>
  <p> Worf takes a breath... tries to relax.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I think you're under more stress<br>
    than you'd like to admit. Maybe<br>
    you should get some rest...</p>
  <p> Worf nods, knows she's right.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes... perhaps you are right.<br>
    Excuse me.</p>
  <p> Worf stands and walks off. Troi looks after him,<br>
    surprised.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I didn't mean right now...</p>
  <p> But Worf is already at the door. OFF Troi's<br>
    puzzlement...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>12 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Later. The room is DARK. Worf is lying in bed,<br>
    dressed in his nightclothes, trying to sleep. He<br>
    tosses and turns for a moment, restless... then his<br>
    eyes shoot open. He sits up and glances around with<br>
    the room... jumps off the bed and begins to move around<br>
    the room in search of something... his movements quick<br>
    and predatory, strange. Worf is changing... some sort<br>
    of primordial instincts taking over...</p>
  <p> He zeroes in on a particular spot on the floor, seems<br>
    to find what he's looking for. He bends down and<br>
    sniffs around that area, taking in the scent, making<br>
    sure it's the right place. Satisfied, he rushes back<br>
    to the bed and tosses off the blankets and pillows. He<br>
    then begins to violently TEAR THE MATTRESS APART.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He rips out large amounts of stuffing... grabs an<br>
    armful and takes over to his &quot;spot&quot; on the floor. He<br>
    throws the stuffing down and arranges it to form a<br>
    &quot;nest&quot; of sorts...</p>
  <p> Satisfied, Worf lays down in the spot. He curls up in<br>
    a fetal ball and closes his eyes. Within seconds he is<br>
    asleep.</p>
  <p> OFF the bizarre moment...</p>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>13 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> GEORDI and Barclay are reporting to Riker. Barclay is<br>
    very animated throughout the scene, bristling with<br>
    nervous energy and mannerisms -- even more so than<br>
    usual. It is a very subtle behavioral change, the<br>
    foreshadowing of a more radical transformation. Riker,<br>
    on the other hand, seems a little slow -- one step<br>
    behind the others. This is the subtle beginnings of<br>
    Riker losing his intellectual capabilities.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (very quick)<br>
    We removed the torpedo bay's<br>
    primary guidance module and found<br>
    a power fluctuation in the forward<br>
    sensor cluster and we think there<br>
    may be a radial imbalance in the<br>
    phase discriminator. Now what we<br>
    want to do next is run a level<br>
    four diagnostic, but that's going<br>
    to mean shutting down auxiliary<br>
    power to nineteen decks and --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (cutting in)<br>
    Wait... slow down... I lost you<br>
    back there...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Which sensor cluster?</p>
  <p> Barclay scratches the side of his face, a nervous<br>
    twitch that continues throughout the scene.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (quick)<br>
    The forward. It's... it's a power<br>
    fluctuation in the converter<br>
    nodes. Minor adjustment -- minor.</p>
  <p> Riker gives him a blank look. Geordi steps in, trying<br>
    to help, hands Riker a PADD.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re: PADD)<br>
    It's all right in here in this<br>
    diagram, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker stares at the PADD for a long moment, trying to<br>
    make sense of the diagram. There's an awkward beat.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll... take a look at this later.<br>
    In the meantime, go ahead and run<br>
    your diagnostic. I'll notify all<br>
    departments about the power shutdown.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, a small ALARM goes off on a console across<br>
    the room. Barclay whirls around.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I'll check that!</p>
  <p> Barclay rushes across the room to the console. Riker<br>
    eyes him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: Barclay)<br>
    He's full of energy today.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I can't get him to slow down.<br>
    He's been working since late last<br>
    night...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Looks like a plasma conduit just<br>
    cut out in Junction Seventeen.<br>
    I'll go take a look...</p>
  <p> Barclay grabs an equipment case and heads for the<br>
    Jefferies Tube.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hold on, Reg -- I'll go with you!<br>
    (to Riker, on the move)<br>
    We'll keep you posted, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker nods. As Geordi EXITS into the Jefferies Tube...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>14 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Troi is standing watch, dressed in her uniform. Worf<br>
    is working at Tactical. He looks sullen and somewhat<br>
    disheveled -- his hair is slightly mussed and his<br>
    uniform is wrinkled. Ensign Dern and N.D.s at<br>
    stations. Troi shivers a little, cold.</p>

  <p> Troi turns to him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf, it's freezing in here.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You have already raised the<br>

    she stands and heads for the door.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I need a bath...<br>
    (to Worf)<br>

  <p> Barclay and Geordi crawling along, Barclay carrying the<br>
    equipment case. Barclay is crawling quickly and with<br>
    great skill -- Geordi can barely keep up. They come to<br>
    a stop at a CORRODED PANEL that looks like it's been<br>
    eaten away by acid.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Here we are.<br>
    (eyes panel)<br>
    It looks like the conduit<br>
    ruptured. No problem, I'll just<br>
    bypass it...</p>
  <p> Barclay opens a SECOND PANEL along the wall, and sets<br>
    the PANEL COVER on the floor. He reaches into the acideaten<br>
    panel and grabs hold of a CABLE, which FRITZES<br>
    with an ELECTRICAL FLASH for a moment. He begins to<br>
    insert the cable in the second wall panel, re-routing<br>
    it...</p>
  <p> As Barclay works, Geordi scans the acid-eaten panel<br>
    with his tricorder.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    Reg... wait a second... look at<br>
    the corroded edges... and the<br>
    blast pattern. This conduit<br>
    didn't just rupture on its own...<br>
    it looks like something dissolved<br>
    the bulkhead and ate through the<br>
    conduit...</p>
  <p> Barclay stops, looks at the panel and runs a hand<br>
    across his face -- that nervous twitch again.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    And that... that caused the<br>
    rupture?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I think so. Whatever dissolved<br>
    the bulkhead was highly<br>
    corrosive... but it's not like<br>
    any solvent I've ever seen...</p>
  <p> Barclay continues re-routing the cable. Geordi moves<br>
    in closer to the panel, scanning.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There's a high level of cholic<br>
    acid here... enzymatic agents...<br>
    If I didn't know any better, I'd<br>
    say this solvent was organic.</p>
  <p> Barclay completes his work, scratches at his face in<br>
    confusion.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (quick)<br>
    Maybe we should run a bio-spectral<br>
    analysis of the solvent... take a<br>
    closer look.</p>
  <p> Geordi nods... and yawns, tired.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Good idea. But let's take a break<br>

    I don't know what's gotten into<br>
    you, Reg...</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf... what are you doing in<br>
    here?</p>
  <p> Worf is focused on Troi -- seems intent on seducing her<br>
    and is unaware of her concern. His primal drives have<br>
    completely taken over now, and there is a terrifying<br>
    predatory quality to his behavior. When he speaks,<br>
    there is a growl-like edge to his voice.</p>

  <p>23 NEW ANGLE - ON WORF</p>
  <p> who is sitting on a bio-bed, staring into middle<br>
    distance. His mouth is open and he is breathing<br>
    heavily. He ignores Beverly as she comes over and<br>
    scans him with a tricorder.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Worf, have you had any unusual<br>
    symptoms lately? Headaches...<br>
    nausea... dizziness?</p>
  <p> No response.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Worf? Worf... can you hear me?</p>
  <p> Worf won't even look at her -- he's in his own world.<br>
    She reaches over and lifts one of his eyelids, looks at<br>
    his eyes closely.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I think we'd better run a full bio-scan.<br>
    I want you to lie down.</p>
  <p> He ignores her. She tries to gently press him back<br>
    onto the bed.</p>

  <p> He stiffens and won't move.</p>

    (continuing)<br>
    Okay... we'll do this sitting up.</p>
  <p> She starts to move away, but stops when she sees<br>
    something on Worf's neck. She leans in close for a<br>
    better look...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT TWO 27.</p>
  <p>24 CLOSE ON WORF'S NECK</p>
  <p> There is a small, veiny POUCH on Worf's neck just below<br>
    the jaw line, back towards his ear.</p>

  <p> Beverly reacts to the strange sight.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What's this... ?</p>
  <p> She gingerly touches the pouch...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Worf, how long have you had this<br>
    on your neck?</p>
  <p> No answer. Beverly begins to scan him with her<br>
    tricorder... is amazed at what she finds...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

  <p> Worf doesn't respond. Beverly reaches out to open his<br>
    mouth. As she touches his face, Worf's eyes flash like<br>
    an animal caught unaware and he looks at her. He opens<br>
    his mouth and SPRAYS her from some hidden ducts inside<br>
    his mouth -- like a spitting cobra. A BLAST of VENOM<br>
    catches Beverly full in the face. She screams, falls<br>
    back to the floor, her hands reaching toward her face.<br>
    Worf leaps out the bed and runs out the door.</p>

    containers are strewn about -- the room is in a state<br>
    of disarray. Picard and Data's shuttlecraft is now<br>
    parked in the bay, its door OPEN. Picard and Data step<br>
    out of the shuttle, phasers drawn, holding palm<br>
    beacons. They look around the empty room... then Data<br>
    moves to a wall panel, taps it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

  <p> Picard reacts to this as they reach the door, phasers<br>
    at-the-ready...</p>
  <p>34 INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Picard and Data ENTER the DARK corridor and start<br>
    walking, aware and ready for anything. Somewhere in<br>
    the distance we can hear strange ANIMALISTIC SOUNDS --<br>
    howls... screeches... clicks... distant CRIES of<br>
    pain... strange and eerie.</p>

    Yes, sir. I am able to discern<br>
    over three hundred different<br>
    vocalizations.</p>
  <p> They continue walking... the strange sounds echoing<br>
    through the ship. Picard sees something lying on the<br>
    floor and moves to it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Look at this...</p>
  <p> They stop at a long, dried SKIN HUSK, like the shedding<br>
    of a snake-skin -- but it has a vaguely humanoid shape.<br>
    Data scans it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    It is composed of reptilian DNA...<br>
    I believe it is an epidermal layer<br>
    that has been cast off during<br>
    molting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But it seems to be humanoid...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. I cannot explain it.<br>
    There are no species aboard the<br>
    Enterprise that shed their skin in<br>
    this fashion.</p>
  <p> Picard considers, then indicates that they should move<br>
    on. They stand and continue walking. Data sees<br>
    something on a nearby door and moves to it. The door<br>
    is covered with CONDENSATION. They react to the<br>
    strange sight.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is Commander Troi's<br>
    quarters... can you tell if she's<br>
    inside?</p>

    into the corridor from within. They walk into the<br>
    room...</p>
  <p>35 INT. TROI'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Picard and Data ENTER. The room is filled with a light<br>
    MIST -- it's like the inside of a greenhouse, damp and<br>
    hot. Picard moves to a desk console, checks it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The environmental settings in this<br>
    room have been altered...</p>
  <p> Data looks around the room, then heads in the direction<br>
    of the bathroom. Picard follows...</p>
  <p>36 INT. TROI'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Picard and Data ENTER the steamy room. Picard sees the<br>
    bathtub, which is completely filled with water. He<br>
    moves to it and stares down into the water --</p>
  <p>37 TROI</p>
  <p> is visible beneath the water's surface. She's in<br>
    uniform, lying face-down, hair drifting in the water.<br>
    She looks dead.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Deanna!</p>
  <p> Picard immediately thrusts both arms into the water and<br>
    grabs hold of Troi's upper-body, pulls her head up and<br>
    out into the air --</p>
  <p> Troi starts to GASP, her mouth gulping horribly for<br>
    air. We now see that there are two GILL SLITS on<br>
    either side of her neck, and that her skin is covered<br>
    with a OILY SHEEN -- like the skin of an eel.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Her EYES shoot open, revealing that they are an inhuman<br>
    GOLD COLOR with a RED SLIT running vertically down the<br>
    middle. It's a bizarre amalgam of human and amphibian<br>
    features.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (horrified)<br>
    What's happened to her... ?</p>
  <p> Troi looks around with quick, darting movements --<br>
    alien, strange. She doesn't seem to recognize Picard<br>
    or Data... seems unaware of her surroundings. She has<br>
    been utterly transformed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    Her DNA is in a state of ribocyatic<br>
    flux... her genetic codes<br>

  <p> Data scans the wound.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is Klingon DNA in the wound.<br>

    floor -- it's Ensign Dern. They quickly move to Dern,<br>
    who has nasty-looking scratch marks on his face,<br>
    uniform in tatters. Data scans him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    His upper spinal column has been<br>
    broken in three places.</p>

    Has his DNA changed, as well?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. However, the mutation was in<br>

  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker whirls around, a startled look on his face. He<br>
    has transformed into a PROTO-HUMAN. He has a<br>
    pronounced forehead, large orbital ridge and nose...<br>
    and his TEETH have changed -- protruding upper-palate<br>
    and long canines. Dark HAIR covers his hands and face.<br>
    He resembles a cross between a modern human and an<br>
    early primate.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    His cranial plates have thickened<br>
    by twenty percent -- his brain is<br>
    much smaller, sir. I doubt he can<br>
    comprehend our language.</p>
  <p> Riker tilts his head at their words, as if some part of<br>
    him might understand. He makes a low, throaty sound in<br>
    response, keeps his eyes trained on them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> Riker suddenly grabs the desktop terminal and THROWS it<br>
    at Picard, who manages to get out of the way. Riker<br>
    LUNGES for Picard -- GRABS hold of him, growling low<br>
    and vicious. Data quickly PULLS Riker off of Picard<br>
    and FIRES his phaser. Riker is jolted backward a<br>
    step... but quickly recovers and heads for Data with a<br>
    rabid expression. Data FIRES again, and this time<br>
    Riker FALLS to the floor, unconscious. They both move<br>
    to him.</p>

  <p> ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>41 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> A short time later. The room is DARK. Picard and Data<br>
    are standing next to the operating table, where the<br>
    proto-humanoid Riker is lying unconscious. Data is<br>
    working the controls on the table. Picard is injecting<br>
    Riker with a hypospray.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This tranquilizer should keep him<br>
    unconscious for another seven<br>
    hours.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    What have you found out?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have analyzed Commander Riker's<br>
    DNA structure. A synthetic T-cell<br>
    has invaded his genetic code.<br>
    This T-cell has begun to activate<br>
    his latent introns.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Introns?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    They are genetic codes which are<br>
    normally dormant. They are<br>
    evolutionary holdovers --<br>
    sequences of DNA that provided key<br>
    physical and behavioral<br>
    characteristics millions of years<br>
    ago, but are no longer necessary.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    For instance, Counselor Troi's<br>
    gill slits and other amphibious<br>
    characteristics were derived from<br>
    introns which still contain<br>
    amphibious codes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So these... introns are causing<br>
    her DNA to re-combine in an<br>
    earlier configuration?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct. In her case, the<br>
    DNA is creating an amphibious<br>
    lifeform which became extinct over<br>
    fifty million years ago.</p>
  <p> Picard considers this bizarre notion, stares down at<br>
    Riker for a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander Riker's introns are<br>
    changing him into one of the<br>
    earlier hominids...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. I would say...<br>
    Australopithacine.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Each of these stages is another<br>
    link in the evolutionary chain,<br>
    stretching back to the origins of<br>
    all lifeforms on Earth.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Because introns can include<br>
    genetic material from many<br>
    different species over millions of<br>
    years of evolution, it is possible<br>
    that a wide variety of<br>
    transformations is occurring among<br>
    the crew.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What about crewmembers who are not<br>
    from Earth?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    All humanoid life has a similar<br>
    genetic pattern. The virus should<br>
    affect non-human crewmembers in<br>
    the same way. They are each deevolving<br>
    to earlier forms of life<br>
    on their homeworlds.</p>
  <p> Data looks at him, tries to find the best way to put<br>
    this...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I feel I must point out, sir, that<br>
    you have become infected with the<br>
    intron virus, as well.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT FOUR 42A.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard reacts, disturbed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long before I start to change?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    According to my calculations,<br>
    within the next twelve hours, you<br>
    will begin to exhibit the first<br>
    signs of your eventual<br>
    transformation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Which will be what... ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe you will also de-evolve<br>
    into some form of early primate.<br>
    Possibly similar to a lemur, or<br>
    pygmy marmoset.</p>
  <p> A long, terrible beat. Picard tries to make light of<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well... before I begin scurrying<br>
    about, searching for food, we need<br>
    to find some answers.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    How do we reverse the process?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am uncertain. We will need to<br>
    run several micro-cellular scans.<br>
    However, the ship's main computer<br>
    has been damaged. Possibly by<br>
    crewmembers who did not know what<br>
    they were doing.<br>
    (thinks)<br>
    The computer in my quarters has an<br>
    independent processing and memory<br>
    storage unit, and should not be<br>
    affected. I suggest we work from<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed.</p>
  <p> They both pull out their phasers and head for the<br>
    door...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>42 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Picard and Data ENTER and move to Data's desk. Almost<br>
    immediately, we hear the sounds of MEWING KITTENS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data reacts.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe Spot has had her<br>
    kittens.</p>
  <p> They move to an area near the bed, where we see a small<br>
    LITTER OF KITTENS huddled together. Data bends down<br>
    and gently examines them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They sound hungry.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. I am curious as to why Spot<br>
    is not taking care of them.</p>
  <p> Data stands and glances around, then moves to a nearby<br>
    chair. He looks behind it and reacts to what he sees --</p>
  <p>43 ANGLE BEHIND CHAIR</p>
  <p> where sitting in the middle of Spot's toys is a large,<br>
    cat-sized IGUANA -- it is wearing Spot's collar.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Spot... ?</p>
  <p> Picard comes over and sees the reptile.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It would seem the intron virus<br>
    isn't limited to humanoid<br>
    lifeforms.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> Data thinks for a moment, then gets an idea. He scans<br>
    the iguana with his tricorder, then walks over to the<br>
    kittens and scans them, as well.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    These kittens were born within the<br>
    last twenty-four hours. It<br>
    appears that Spot's transformation<br>
    took place at approximately the<br>
    same time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So... Spot gave birth to the<br>
    kittens while she was... changing<br>
    into a reptilian form?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe so. For some reason,<br>
    the intron virus was not passed on<br>
    to the kittens. I do not know<br>
    why.</p>
  <p> They think about this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As I remember my biology, there<br>
    are several natural immune systems<br>
    that come into play in the womb of<br>
    the mother... to protect the<br>
    unborn from viral infections...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is true. The placental<br>
    barrier, maternal antibodies and<br>
    amniotic fluid all serve as a<br>
    filtration system.</p>
  <p> Picard thinks -- he's onto something...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Maybe we could... inhibit this<br>
    intron virus by using some of the<br>
    natural antibodies in Spot's<br>
    amniotic fluid...</p>
  <p> Data considers.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It would take further research,<br>
    but I believe that to be effective<br>
    on humanoid crewmembers, humanoid<br>
    antibodies would be necessary.</p>

  <p>43 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then perhaps we should locate a<br>
    humanoid who's pregnant...</p>
  <p> Data nods, remembers something.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Nurse Ogawa recently became<br>
    pregnant...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then we need to locate Nurse<br>
    Ogawa.</p>
  <p> Data moves to his desk and works the console.</p>

    I have traced her combadge signal<br>
    to Deck Seventeen, Section Twentyone<br>
    Alpha.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> Before they can head out the door, the ship suddenly<br>
    SHAKES. Data checks his desk console.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    One of the warp plasma vents has<br>
    failed. Main Engineering has been<br>
    abandoned -- there is no one there<br>
    to fix the problem.</p>
  <p> Picard nods -- they'd better fix it. As they head for<br>
    the door...</p>

  <p>44 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Picard and Data ENTER the room with caution, their<br>
    phasers drawn, ready for anything. The room is DARK<br>
    and various consoles are FLICKERING on and off. Data<br>
    moves to the pool table, starts to work.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I can repair the damaged plasma<br>
    vent from here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'd better check the status of the<br>
    warp core...</p>
  <p> Picard heads toward Geordi's office...</p>
  <p>45 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> in Geordi's office. Picard moves to a console and<br>
    stops. The console is covered in gossamer strands of<br>
    FIBROUS MATERIAL -- web-like, strange. He looks around --<br>
    the fibers are everywhere, some of the fibers are even<br>
    hanging from the ceiling...</p>
  <p> A strange CHITTERING NOISE is heard -- rapid little<br>
    clicks, insect-like. Picard turns at the sound... he<br>
    seems on edge, nervous... moves to the glass partition<br>
    and looks out at the darkened warp core chamber...</p>
  <p> Without warning, something SLAMS into the glass.<br>
    Picard leaps back, very startled, and is shocked to see --</p>
  <p>46 BARCLAY</p>
  <p> who has transformed into a horrible cross between human<br>
    and SPIDER. His EYES are black and bulbous -- and he<br>
    has three smaller EYES growing out of his forehead.<br>
    His skin is mottled with distinctive colorations and<br>
    hairy CILIA. His hands are completely unrecognizable --<br>
    hooked and terrible. Barclay is BANGING against the<br>
    glass, trying to get at Picard.</p>
  <p> Picard levels his phaser at Barclay, breathless and on<br>
    the verge of panic.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (calls out)<br>
    Data!</p>
  <p> Data rushes in, As he enters, Barclay quickly scitters<br>
    away, out of view. Picard and Data cautiously enter<br>
    the warp core chamber, look around. Barclay is nowhere<br>
    in sight.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (shaken)<br>
    What was that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe it was Lieutenant<br>
    Barclay. He appeared to be<br>
    partially transformed into an<br>
    arachnid.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A spider?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I recognized the chitin<br>

    member of the Pisauridae family.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a breath, holds out his hand, which is<br>
    trembling. He is uncharacteristically anxious and<br>
    rattled. He looks about from side to side, as though<br>
    reacting to a looming threat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain. Are you all right?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have the most intense feeling<br>

    (beat)<br>
    I can't explain it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You may be experiencing the<br>
    initial stages of your<br>

    heightened sense of awareness.</p>
  <p> Picard looks around, worried.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If that's the case, then my<br>

    Her brow, forehead and jaw region are more<br>

    bio-bed nearby, covered with a blanket, unconscious.<br>
    Riker is also there, unconscious. Picard is in the<br>

    Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard quickly moves to him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (re: Ogawa)<br>
    I have analyzed Nurse Ogawa's<br>
    embryo. It has been unaffected by<br>
    the virus. I believe I can use<br>
    her amniotic fluid as a template<br>
    for a retro-virus. It would<br>
    neutralize the synthetic T-cell,<br>
    and re-establish the original<br>
    genetic patterns of each host.</p>
  <p> Picard looks relieved.</p>

    Something is trying to get into the room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (anxious)<br>
    What -- what's that?</p>
  <p> There is a low, terrifying HOWL from the corridor. And<br>
    then a SNIFFING sound begins around the door frame --<br>
    the unseen creature is looking for a way in. Data<br>

    Set your phaser to heavy stun.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We have no way of knowing if the<br>

    Klingon HOWL -- the same distinctive cry as before.<br>
    Something about the howl strikes a chord in Picard, who<br>
    is struggling to stay calm and rational...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (re: howl)<br>
    Listen to that... he sounds<br>
    angry... aggressive...<br>

    of them, rather than attempt to<br>
    break through a door.</p>
  <p> Another HIT against the door, and the sound of creaking<br>
    metal. Picard flinches at the noise, heart racing, his<br>
    instincts telling him to run. Another ROAR from<br>

    a medical SAMPLER DEVICE. He applies it to Troi's<br>
    neck.</p>

  <p>52 INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS, the hypospray in one hand, phaser in the<br>
    other. He immediately moves to the opposite wall,<br>
    presses his back close against it. He steels himself,<br>
    then slowly peers around the corner...</p>
  <p>53 PICARD'S POV</p>
  <p> of Worf, who can be seen pounding on the door to<br>
    Sickbay. He is barely visible in the darkness, a<br>
    hulking form. We should get the merest glimpse that he<br>
    has gone through a remarkable transformation into<br>
    something larger and more powerful. (See description<br>
    below.)</p>
  <p>54 PICARD</p>
  <p> quickly pulls back... he reaches around the corner with<br>
    the hypospray... then sprays the pheromones into the<br>
    air with a HISSING sound. A long beat goes by... and<br>
    the pounding noise stops. Picard listens carefully...<br>
    silence... then pounding FOOTSTEPS are heard coming his<br>
    way. It's working! Worf lets out a mating HOWL, as<br>
    heard before.</p>
  <p> Picard takes off running down the corridor -- the chase<br>
    is on...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>55 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Data is working at the large WALL MONITOR, trying to<br>
    get the computer on-line.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Computer -- activate medical<br>

  <p> The wall monitor COMES ALIVE. Satisfied, Data moves<br>
    across the room to Ogawa...</p>
  <p>56 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Quick action. Picard running down the corridor,<br>
    spraying pheromones into the air as he goes. We can<br>
    hear Worf's FOOTSTEPS not far behind. Picard comes to<br>
    an intersection, ducks into another corridor and sprays<br>
    the pheromones down that hall... sprays some more all<br>
    around the intersection itself in an attempt to confuse<br>
    Worf. He runs down a third corridor...</p>
  <p>57 INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> (Near the Transporter Room set.) Picard ENTERS and<br>
    runs down the long hall... and stops. He's at a deadend.<br>
    He turns to go back, but the FOOTSTEPS are<br>
    rapidly approaching. No time. He quickly moves to the<br>
    Turbolift and taps the control pad. Nothing happens.<br>
    Picard works at the control pad, desperately trying to<br>
    get the door open... suspense building as the footsteps<br>
    are getting closer and closer...</p>
  <p> The Turbolift doors finally SLIDE OPEN. Picard is<br>
    about to enter when he hears a ROAR right behind him.<br>
    He whirls around to see --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>58 WORF</p>
  <p> standing at the far end of the hall, looking directly<br>
    at him. This is the first time we get a real look at<br>
    the de-evolved Klingon. His HEAD has been utterly<br>
    transformed -- his RIDGES are huge and curved,<br>
    bristling with sharp edges and pointed angles. The<br>
    ridges extend downward, encasing his entire face. His<br>
    jaw and mouth region are protected by the same hard,<br>
    black chitin-like material, and a LARGE MANDIBLE is<br>
    snapping open and shut. Worf is hunched over, his body<br>
    bulkier, more powerful, uniform torn in places. This<br>
    is a Klingon from millions of years ago -- prehistoric<br>
    and terrifying.</p>
  <p> There is a heart-stopping moment as the two men stare<br>
    at one another. Picard frozen with fear; Worf staring<br>
    with a look of realization -- he's been fooled. Worf<br>
    tilts back his head and lets out a ROAR of rage. He<br>
    starts moving toward Picard...</p>
  <p>59 PICARD</p>
  <p> turns and enters the Turbolift...</p>
  <p>60 WORF'S POV</p>
  <p> rushing toward Picard...</p>
  <p>61 INT. TURBOLIFT - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> The doors close just as Worf reaches them. The Lift is<br>
    JOLTED as he hits the doors from the outside.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Lift)<br>
    Deck Seventeen.</p>
  <p> No response. Picard works a control pad. The doors<br>
    start to OPEN... slowly... Worf prying them apart with<br>
    both hands. Picard can't get the Lift moving -- the<br>
    controls won't respond. He shrinks back in fear,<br>
    instincts rattling his nerves. He glances around,<br>
    desperate -- trapped.</p>
  <p> The doors are opening -- we can now see Worf's face<br>
    through the crack of the doors... he's looking in...</p>
  <p> Picard struggles to stay in control. He looks up at<br>
    the ceiling with intent -- stretches upward and grabs<br>
    hold of the HATCH on the ceiling and begins to remove<br>
    it... (NOTE: We do not see him actually remove<br>
    anything.)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>62 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data at the operating table. He INJECTS Ogawa with a<br>
    hypospray, then looks at the wall monitor.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Computer, display progress of<br>
    genetic re-sequencing.</p>
  <p> The wall monitor displays a GRAPHIC of a MUTATED DNA<br>
    STRAND that is rapidly RE-ORDERING itself. Data<br>
    watches the graphic closely as the strand shifts and<br>
    twists and breaks apart in a frenzy of re-sequencing...</p>
  <p>63 INT. JEFFERIES TUBE</p>
  <p> Picard is crawling vertically through the narrow<br>
    passageway. He stops at a hatch... moves to one side,<br>
    cautious -- holds his phaser ready and hits a control<br>
    by the door...</p>
  <p>64 INT. JEFFERIES TUBE INTERSECTION</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS from another Jefferies Tube and stands<br>
    upright. He moves to another set of doors, but stops<br>
    when a sudden NOISE echoes somewhere nearby. He stops<br>
    and cocks his head, listening closely much like an<br>
    animal would. He eyes the doors with concern...<br>
    levels his phaser at the doors and hits a control --</p>
  <p> The doors open -- no one is there. Picard bends over<br>
    to enter the horizontal tube when a BLAST of VENOM<br>
    sprays down from above. Picard cries out, drops the<br>
    phaser, which falls away, lost. Picard falls to the<br>
    floor... looks up...</p>
  <p>65 PICARD'S POV - THE GRATING ABOVE</p>
  <p> Worf is staring down at him from beyond the grating, in<br>
    the Jefferies Tube above. He ROARS ferociously.</p>
  <p>66 PICARD</p>
  <p> grabs his arm, which is covered with ACID BURNS from<br>
    the venom. He struggles to his feet, heads into the<br>
    horizontal Tube...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>67 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The wall monitor shows that the DNA strand has now<br>
    FROZEN and looks more normal than before.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Genetic re-sequencing in progress --<br>
    DNA to seventy percent normal.</p>
  <p> Data looks down at Ogawa. We can see a subtle change<br>
    in Ogawa's appearance now -- her pronounced brow is<br>
    gone, and she is pale, perspiring from the rigor of the<br>
    transformation. Data injects her again with the<br>
    hypospray, looks at the monitor.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Computer, increase nucleotide<br>
    substitution by thirty-two<br>
    percent.</p>
  <p> The graphic shows the DNA re-ordering itself even<br>
    further...</p>
  <p>68 INT. JEFFERIES TUBE</p>
  <p> Picard struggling to make his way down the horizontal<br>
    passage. An access hatch opens behind him -- it's<br>
    Worf. The Klingon starts after him. It's a tense<br>
    chase down the crawlway until --</p>
  <p>69 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Picard reaches an opened panel -- it's the same acideaten<br>
    panel seen in Act Two. The power cable which<br>
    Barclay re-routed earlier is still visible stretching<br>
    across the Tube. Picard grabs hold of it, RIPS the<br>
    cable from the panel with a fritzing sound. The end of<br>
    the cable is CRACKLING with PLASMA ENERGY. He aims it<br>
    at Worf.</p>
  <p> Worf keeps coming, a threat. Picard grabs the panel<br>
    cover which is lying nearby and places it in front of<br>
    him -- then he steps onto the cover, crouches down with<br>
    both feet on top of it making sure that no part of his<br>
    body is touching the Tube.</p>
  <p> Worf is almost on top of him when Picard jams the end<br>
    of the cable into the metal grating of the Jefferies<br>
    Tube --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Genesis&quot; - 01/07/94 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>70 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE JEFFERIES TUBE LIGHTS UP<br>
    WITH AN ELECTRICAL FLASH. The panel cover that Picard<br>
    is crouching on is unaffected, and this protects Picard<br>
    from the plasma charge. Worf is JOLTED violently, then<br>
    he collapses. Picard removes the cable from the metal<br>
    grating... stares at the figure of Worf, who is still<br>
    breathing heavily... unconscious.</p>

    Captain's log, supplemental.<br>
    Commander Data has succeeded in<br>
    returning the crew to normal.<br>
    Doctor Crusher has determined that<br>
    the synthetic T-cell she used to<br>
    cure Mister Barclay's Urodelan flu<br>
    initiated the intron virus which<br>
    swept through the ship.</p>
  <p>74 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Barclay is sitting on a bio-bed, in uniform. Beverly<br>
    is scanning him with a tricorder. Troi is sitting on<br>
    the bed next to them (she's normal now), being treated<br>
    by a Medical N.D. In the b.g., other crewmembers are<br>
    visible lying on the beds, being treated by Medical<br>
    N.D.s. Mid-conversation.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    So... this was my fault...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No... in a way, it was mine. I<br>
    didn't realize it at the time, but<br>
    there's an anomaly in your genetic<br>
    chemistry that caused the<br>
    synthetic T-cell to mutate...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Instead of just activating one<br>
    dormant gene, it started to<br>
    activate all of them -- including<br>
    your introns.</p>

    And that... that caused me to devolve...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
