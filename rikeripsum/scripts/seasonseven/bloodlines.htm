  <p> at impulse.</p>
  <p>1 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> RIKER, DATA and WORF are at their usual stations, along<br>
    with assorted SUPERNUMERARIES. There's a feeling of<br>
    urgency in the air. PICARD ENTERS from his Ready Room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Report.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There's an object of some kind<br>
    closing in on our position.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p> The VIEWSCREEN magnifies to display a metallic PROBE.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    It appears to be an unmanned probe --<br>
    approximately half a meter in<br>
    diameter. It has no identifiable<br>
    armaments.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are being hailed...</p>
  <p> Worf looks down at his console, makes a correction.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    You are being hailed, sir -- by<br>
    name.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker exchange a glance -- what could this<br>
    be all about?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Open a channel.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - 02/09/94 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>

  <p>1 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Worf interrupts with urgency --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am reading a power surge --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Shields up.</p>
  <p> On the VIEWSCREEN we see a BEAM shoot out from the<br>
    probe toward us -- everyone tenses for impact... but<br>
    nothing happens. Data studies his console with<br>
    interest.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The beam appears to contain<br>
    holographic imaging information...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's trying to project<br>
    something...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Isolate the bandwidth and let the<br>
    signal through the shields.</p>
  <p> Data works his console; after a moment a TRANSLUCENT<br>
    HOLOGRAM shimmers into being near the door to Picard's<br>
    Ready Room -- it is the Ferengi, DAIMON BOK, who once<br>
    swore vengeance on Picard...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Bok...</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    I trust you remember me, Picard,<br>
    because I haven't forgotten you...<br>
    or how you murdered my son...</p>
  <p> Bok's eyes are full of hate... since this is prerecorded,<br>
    he should not appear to be interacting with<br>
    our people.</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    For fifteen years I've thought<br>
    about how to avenge his death...<br>
    but nothing I could do to you<br>
    could equal what you did to me...<br>
    until now.</p>
  <p> Bok smiles, but there's no mirth in it.</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    You thought you could hide him<br>
    from me, didn't you? But I found<br>
    out about him... Jason Vigo is as<br>
    good as dead.</p>

  <p>1 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Bok's eyes go cold with hatred.</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    I'm going to kill your son,<br>
    Picard, just like you killed<br>
    mine...</p>
  <p> Picard looks utterly baffled -- his son? With a<br>
    taunting smile the hologram DISAPPEARS. Off Picard's<br>
    reaction we...</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>2 INT. BRIDGE -- CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> All eyes are on Picard. He's said nothing to indicate<br>
    what he thinks of Bok's claim... and no one's about to<br>
    ask.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Put a tractor beam on that probe<br>
    and determine if it's safe to beam<br>
    it aboard. I want to know where<br>
    it came from.</p>
  <p> He turns to Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, see if there's any<br>
    mention of a Jason Vigo in<br>
    Federation records.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You might start with Miranda Vigo --<br>
    she was born on New Gaul about<br>
    forty years ago...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Data heads for aft science. Picard turns to Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Contact the Ferengi Government and<br>
    find out what you can about Bok.<br>
    He was wearing a Daimon's uniform --<br>
    if he's regained his rank, I want<br>
    to know why.</p>
  <p> And with that, Picard EXITS to his Ready Room, leaving<br>
    everyone to wonder what's going through his mind.</p>
  <p>3 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it hangs in space.</p>
  <p>4 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> where Picard is staring out his window, lost in<br>
    thought. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - REV. 02/10/94 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS carrying a PADD.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Ferengi Government is debating<br>
    an amendment to the Rules of<br>
    Acquisition...<br>
    (wry)<br>
    -- it might be a while before they<br>
    get back to us...</p>
  <p> Picard nods vaguely. Riker indicates the PADD he's<br>
    holding.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data found out that the woman you<br>
    mentioned does have a son named<br>
    Jason.</p>
  <p> Picard takes this in, but gives away nothing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is the most recent picture we<br>
    could find.</p>
  <p> He sets the PADD on Picard's desk, and the Captain<br>
    turns from the window and studies it for a beat.</p>
  <p>5 INSERT - THE PADD</p>
  <p> showing the picture of a ten year old boy.</p>
  <p>6 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> Picard asks a question that could confirm or disprove<br>
    Bok's assertion.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How old is the boy now?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Twenty three.</p>
  <p> Picard's mental calculation is internal; he gives away<br>
    nothing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - 02/09/94 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He and his mother left Earth about<br>
    six years ago and settled on Camor<br>
    Five. That's all we know, the<br>
    planet's records are practically<br>
    non-existent.</p>
  <p> Picard speaks to the com system.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard to Bridge. Set course for<br>
    the Camor system, warp five.</p>
  <p> COM VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Thinking that Picard isn't going to say anything more,<br>
    Riker turns to leave.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wil... I appreciate your not<br>
    asking, but you have the right to<br>
    know...</p>
  <p> He turns to face Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There is a possibility that the<br>
    boy is my son... I was involved<br>
    with his mother for a short time<br>
    about twenty four years ago. I<br>
    met her through a friend during<br>
    shore-leave on Earth. It was all<br>
    very romantic...<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    -- probably because we both knew<br>
    I'd be leaving in two weeks... we<br>
    kept in touch for a short while,<br>
    but we never managed to get<br>
    together again...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And she never said anything about<br>
    being pregnant... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No... either Bok's got it wrong<br>
    and I'm not the father, or Miranda<br>
    decided she wanted to raise the<br>
    child on her own. Quite frankly<br>
    it wouldn't surprise me. She was<br>
    very independent... very strong-willed...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - REV. 02/10/94 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You'd have to be to get by on<br>
    Camor Five.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Whether he's really my son or not,<br>
    the fact is he's in danger. Bok<br>
    tried to kill me six years ago...<br>
    I have no doubt he intends to make<br>
    good on his threat against the<br>
    boy...</p>
  <p> Riker acknowledges this grim fact...</p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> entering orbit of Camor Five...</p>
  <p>8 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker now in the command area, Data at Aft<br>
    Science, Worf at Tactical.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Anything?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There are no Ferengi vessels<br>
    within range of our scanners...</p>
  <p> Data turns from aft science.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, I have been unable to<br>
    find any information about Jason<br>
    Vigo's current whereabouts...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What about his mother's?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard considers for a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Miranda was trained as a<br>
    botanist... she used to talk<br>
    about running a farm some day. We<br>
    might start with the agricultural<br>
    areas.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - 02/09/94 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That would significantly narrow<br>
    our search; the only cultivated<br>
    land is on the southern continent,<br>
    and there are relatively few<br>
    people engaged in agricultural<br>
    activities.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There can't be too many non-Camorites<br>
    among them. Try<br>
    scanning for human life-signs.</p>
  <p> Data works his console, and uncovers the following<br>
    little by little.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am detecting seven humans...<br>
    three are female... however they<br>
    are all too young to be Miranda<br>
    Vigo.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What about males?</p>
  <p> Data works his console for a beat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    One is an infant... another is<br>
    elderly... and two are middleaged.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's seven, you said there were<br>
    eight humans.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (works)<br>
    I am having difficulty getting a<br>
    clear reading on the eighth...<br>
    (works console)<br>
    -- the individual appears to be<br>
    located approximately two<br>
    kilometers beneath the planet's<br>
    surface.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker exchange a glance over this odd<br>
    information.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Male or female?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - REV. 02/11/94 - ACT ONE 8A.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Male... adult... between twenty<br>
    and thirty years old.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts -- it could be Jason.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No one in their right mind would<br>
    go that far underground alone.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Unless he was forced to.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Sir, I am reading seismic<br>
    instability in the area. He is in<br>
    danger.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - REV. 02/11/94 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Relay his coordinates to the<br>
    Transporter Room and have them<br>
    beam him aboard.</p>
  <p> Picard starts for the Turbolift.</p>
  <p>9 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard steps into the room, where JASON VIGO is in the<br>
    process of MATERIALIZING. He is a handsome youth of<br>
    about twenty-three, wearing high-tech rock climbing<br>
    gear that's covered in dust. He's in the position of<br>
    someone who was just scaling a rock face.</p>
  <p> When he fully materializes he whirls around --</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    What the... ?</p>
  <p> He stops, confused by the sudden change in locale. He<br>
    locks eyes with Picard and frowns, realizing that he's<br>
    been beamed aboard a Federation Starship.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    This is a Federation ship...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's right. I'm Captain<br>
    Picard... Jean-Luc Picard.</p>
  <p> Jason doesn't seem to recognize the name...</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    (with irony)<br>
    I realize I wasn't supposed to be<br>
    spelunking that cave, but don't<br>
    you have something better to do?</p>
  <p> He says this with an easy and disarming smile.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We thought you were in danger.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - REV. 02/10/94 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Oh... well... I wasn't. Maybe you<br>
    should just beam me back where I<br>
    was?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you Jason Vigo?</p>
  <p> Jason is clearly taken by surprise; why are these<br>
    people looking for him? He decides to dissemble.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    I... know him. Is he in trouble?</p>
  <p> Picard isn't entirely sure whether he believes him or<br>
    not.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In a manner of speaking...<br>
    someone's made a threat against<br>
    his life.</p>
  <p> Jason's face blanches -- Picard's instincts tell him<br>
    why...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jason... I'm an old friend of your<br>
    Mother's. I came here because<br>
    you're in danger.</p>
  <p> Jason isn't about to keep pretending... he's too<br>
    worried for that.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Why would anyone want to kill me?</p>
  <p> Picard takes a breath and comes out with it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The person who made the threat is<br>
    under the impression that... that<br>
    you are my son...</p>
  <p> Jason reacts to this bombshell... after a moment of<br>
    stunned silence...</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Am I... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - REV. 02/10/94 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    My mother never told me who my<br>
    father was... just that he was in<br>
    Starfleet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps we should contact her... ?</p>
  <p> Jason reacts, looks away...</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    She... died a few years ago...</p>
  <p> Picard take in this sad piece of news.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry...</p>
  <p> Jason nods, but says nothing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jason... I think it's important<br>
    that we find out one way or<br>
    another. Would you be willing to<br>
    permit a genetic test?</p>
  <p> Jason acknowledges with a nod.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    If I'm not your son... is this<br>
    person still going to want to kill<br>
    me?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Once he's made aware of the fact,<br>
    I expect he won't...</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    (wry)<br>
    In that case you won't mind my<br>
    saying that I hope you're not my<br>
    father...</p>
  <p> Jason and Picard share a smile and start toward the<br>
    door...</p>
  <p> INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> BEVERLY draws blood from Jason's neck with a DEVICE<br>
    that looks like a hypospray. She takes the blood<br>
    sample over to the Sickbay computers, and while she<br>
    executes the genetic test, Picard and Jason continue to<br>
    talk.</p>

    What were you doing down in that<br>

    No, I just enjoy climbing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Without an antigrav harness... ?</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    They get in the way...</p>
  <p> Picard keeps his reaction to himself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So... what do you do?</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    I'm... between jobs right now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see...</p>
  <p> Picard's at a loss as to what to talk about, and an<br>
    awkward silence settles between them. Mercifully,<br>
    Beverly calls them over to the MONITOR she's studying,<br>
    which shows a DNA DOUBLE-HELIX STRAND rotating in<br>
    place.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Excuse me, gentlemen, but I have<br>
    the results if you want to hear<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> They approach her, and she indicates the DNA on the<br>
    monitor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Jason)<br>
    Your genetic code is a cross<br>
    between the DNA of your mother,<br>
    Miranda Vigo, and your father --<br>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>11 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> where Picard has brought Jason to talk privately.<br>
    Jason is walking around looking at Picard's things. He<br>
    stops when he sees Picard's archaeological collection.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    What is all this... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Archaeological fragments I've<br>
    collected over the years...</p>
  <p> Picard crosses over and shows him a small stone with<br>
    hieroglyphics on it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This is a Silvan glyph stone...</p>
  <p> He shows him a TBD artifact.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And this is a Gorlan prayer<br>
    stick... it's extremely rare...</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Is it valuable... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not really. Only to students of<br>
    archaeology like myself. Still,<br>
    I had to give up a very old bottle<br>
    of Saurian brandy for it.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    I'd say you got taken.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps... but I value it<br>
    nonetheless...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - REV. 02/10/94 - ACT TWO 15.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    On Camor, something has value if<br>
    you can eat it or sell it...<br>
    everything else is a luxury.</p>
  <p> Picard sets down the artifact, uncomfortable, not<br>
    knowing how to reach out to this defensive young man.<br>
    After a beat...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Would you like some tea?</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    No. Thanks.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Something else?</p>
  <p> Jason shakes his head, unforthcoming. Picard goes to<br>
    the replicator.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tea, Earl Grey, hot.</p>
  <p> Neither man talks until we hear the SOUND of the<br>
    replicator and Picard gets his tea. He turns back to<br>
    Jason, gamely tries to proceed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well. I'm sure this whole thing<br>
    is as much a surprise to you as it<br>
    is to me...</p>
  <p> Jason gives a small shrug.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll be honest with you, Jason.<br>
    I was with your mother for only a<br>
    short time. I would like to have<br>
    known her better... but it didn't<br>
    work out that way.</p>
  <p> This seems to have touched a chord. Jason looks down,<br>
    gives a small nod.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - REV. 02/10/94 - ACT TWO 16.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You look a lot like her -- it's<br>
    your eyes, I think...</p>
  <p> Again, Jason doesn't reply, though we get the feeling<br>
    there are a lot of feelings churning inside him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I want to be clear about one thing --<br>
    your mother didn't tell me about<br>
    you. If she had... I would have<br>
    been part of your life.</p>
  <p> Jason turns and looks Picard in the eye for maybe the<br>
    first time in the scene.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    I guess that's not what she<br>
    wanted.</p>
  <p> There's a moment of awkward silence, then Jason stands.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    I think I'd like to go back to the<br>
    surface.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It would be best if you stayed<br>
    aboard the Enterprise... until we<br>
    can resolve the situation with<br>
    Bok.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    What is the situation with Bok,<br>
    anyway? Why does he want me dead?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Years ago, I was forced to destroy<br>
    a starship that was under his<br>
    son's command. Apparently Bok<br>
    feels it would be fitting<br>
    vengeance to kill my son.</p>
  <p> Jason absorbs this.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - REV. 02/10/94 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    I can't hide forever.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course not. We're trying to<br>
    locate Bok... I intend to confront<br>
    him, settle this matter.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    How long will that take?</p>
  <p> There's no real answer to the question.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I assure you -- no one's more<br>
    eager to get this behind us than<br>
    I am.</p>
  <p> Jason stares at him for a beat, then shrugs.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Where do I stay?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll give you quarters.</p>
  <p> Jason grabs his backpack, heads for the door.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Okay. Let's go.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jason... your being here... I hope<br>
    it will give us the chance to get<br>
    to know each other.</p>
  <p> Jason looks away, doesn't respond to the offer of<br>
    friendship Picard has made. He EXITS, and Picard is<br>
    left with nothing to do but follow.</p>
  <p>12 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker in the command area, Worf at Tactical. Picard is<br>
    with Data and GEORDI at aft science.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We managed to shut down the<br>
    probe's power systems so we could<br>
    beam it aboard, but it's not going<br>
    to be easy to figure out where it<br>
    came from.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - 02/09/94 - ACT TWO 17A.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Bok took the precaution of<br>
    encrypting the probe's<br>
    navigational systems so that we<br>
    would be unable to decipher its<br>
    flight path.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We ran an analysis of the probe's<br>
    hull -- from the energy signatures<br>
    and particle deposits we found, it<br>
    looks like it travelled through a<br>
    Dichromic Nebula, was exposed to<br>
    an intensive gravimetric<br>
    distortion, and passed within a<br>
    light year of a class four pulsar.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Those phenomena are relatively<br>
    common -- we would need to<br>
    identify at least one of them<br>
    specifically in order to postulate<br>
    a flight path.</p>
  <p> Picard gives a frustrated nod.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Understood.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Sir, incoming message from Daimon<br>
    Birta.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - 02/09/94 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Worf works his controls and a grand looking Ferengi<br>
    APPEARS on the VIEWSCREEN -- DAIMON BIRTA. He's<br>
    speaking from a Ferengi ship's Bridge, and behind him<br>
    we see a BANNER that bears his personal crest.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you for taking the time to<br>
    talk to us, Daimon.</p>
  <p> BIRTA<br>
    I understand you have a problem.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, it concerns Daimon Bok.</p>
  <p> BIRTA<br>
    Bok is no Daimon. He was relieved<br>
    of command six years ago -- he was<br>
    unstable, dangerous. We had to<br>
    confine him to Rog Prison.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But he's no longer there?</p>
  <p> BIRTA<br>
    (matter of fact)<br>
    He was able to buy himself out<br>
    about two years ago.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Buy himself out?</p>
  <p> BIRTA<br>
    He paid his debt to society.</p>
  <p> Picard decides not to get into this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Considering that he is dangerous<br>
    and unstable, I trust you've kept<br>
    track of him?</p>
  <p> BIRTA<br>
    He's a private citizen. We take<br>
    no responsibility for him.</p>
  <p> Picard feels himself growing frustrated.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see. Do you have any idea of<br>
    his present whereabouts?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - 02/09/94 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BIRTA<br>
    I understand he was seen in the<br>
    Dorias cluster not too long ago...</p>
  <p> Picard can't help but frown at the vagueness of this<br>
    information (behind him, however, Data and Geordi take<br>
    this information and set to work).</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That cluster consists of over<br>
    twenty star systems...</p>
  <p> Birta smiles as if it were nothing.</p>
  <p> BIRTA<br>
    You don't have to thank me,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> And with that the VIEWSCREEN returns to a starfield.<br>
    Geordi turns from the console where he and Data are<br>
    working.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Believe it or not, sir -- that<br>
    might've given us the fix we<br>
    needed. There's a nebula in the<br>
    Dorias cluster that matches the<br>
    particle signature we found on the<br>
    probe.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (working)<br>
    There is a class four pulsar three<br>
    light years from the nebula -- my<br>
    calculations indicate that the<br>
    probe was launched in the Xendi<br>
    Kabu system.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p>13A INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> where Beverly is working. After a moment, Picard<br>
    appears at the door. Beverly smiles and waves him in.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jean-Luc... come in.</p>
  <p> As he takes a seat --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think I need to talk to a<br>
    parent.</p>
  <p> Beverly understand immediately, smiles.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What's he like?</p>
  <p> Picard takes a moment, tries to assess the question.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not sure I can tell you. He's<br>
    put up so many barriers... I don't<br>
    really know what's underneath.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It would certainly be<br>
    understandable if he couldn't<br>
    accept you right away...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can't imagine that he'll ever<br>
    accept me. He won't even talk to<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> Beverly ponders this, wants to offer help.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Keep in mind... he's had twenty<br>
    years to be angry that his father<br>
    wasn't there... it'll take time to<br>
    get over those feelings -- but I<br>
    think it's possible.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - REV. 02/11/94 - ACT TWO 20A.</p>
  <p>13A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps. But surely it would be<br>
    wrong of me to force the issue.</p>
  <p> Beverly senses a kind of relief in Picard as he says<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    He's made it clear he doesn't want<br>
    to pursue a relationship... I<br>
    believe I should respect his<br>
    feelings.</p>
  <p> Beverly takes a beat... speaks carefully...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Of course you want to take your<br>
    cues from him... move slowly...<br>
    but you might want to keep trying<br>
    to get through those barriers.</p>
  <p> But Picard clings to his choice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What I sense about this young<br>
    man... is that he's very<br>
    independent.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I think it's best if I leave him<br>
    alone. Let him come to me if he<br>
    wants.</p>
  <p> Beverly regards him, smiles, shrugs, knowing him well<br>
    enough not to engage in an argument.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Maybe you're right.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I just think you should consider<br>
    one thing.</p>
  <p> He gives her a questioning look.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Are you really thinking about<br>
    what's best for Jason... or<br>
    easiest for you?</p>
  <p> And for that insightful question, Picard has no answer.</p>

    The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Yeah...</p>
  <p> The door opens, revealing TROI in the doorway. Jason<br>
    can't help but notice what an attractive woman she is.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Hello, Jason. I'm Deanna Troi...<br>
    the ship's Counselor.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Come in...</p>
  <p> He steps aside so she can ENTER, giving her a subtle,<br>
    appreciative glance as she passes. He gestures for her<br>
    to take a seat.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Did Captain Picard ask you to come<br>
    talk to me?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No... I just came to see how you<br>
    were doing. A lot's happened in<br>
    the last few hours... I thought<br>
    you might want to talk about it.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    I'll be all right...<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    People have wanted to kill me<br>
    before...</p>
  <p> We're seeing another side of Jason -- while he was<br>
    taciturn with Picard, he's charming and roguish with<br>
    Troi.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But you've never met your father<br>
    before.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    I have to admit I never thought I<br>
    would.</p>

    responses to him, adopting a vulnerability.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    I am a little shaky.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Of course. That's only natural.</p>
  <p> He gives her an endearing smile.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    But you know what? Just talking<br>
    to you... I feel better already.</p>

    Fine...</p>
  <p> She stands and crosses toward the door.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Our shields were up; how could he<br>
    have beamed through them?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't think he did. Sensor logs<br>

    intruder.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Could it have been another<br>
    hologram?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't think so... something has<br>
    to generate a hologram -- we would<br>
    have detected it.</p>
  <p> Picard considers for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Bok once used a mind control<br>
    device to make me hallucinate.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That device gave off a very<br>
    specific energy signature... I'm<br>
    not reading anything like it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Could he have modified the device<br>
    so he could use it without being<br>
    detected?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's possible... I'll recalibrate<br>
    the sensors to scan for low<br>
    intensity transmissions. And just<br>
    to be sure, I'll sweep your<br>
    quarters with a resonance scanner.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good. Keep me posted.</p>

    Yes, sir. He has been charged<br>

    several dozen times for<br>
    trespassing.</p>

    This is the information you<br>
    requested, is it not?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, thank you.</p>

    EXITS. Off Data's face as he watches him go...</p>
  <p>18 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> It is morning. Jason is getting a GLASS of ORANGE<br>
    JUICE from the BARTENDER. When he crosses away, TWO<br>
    SECURITY OFFICERS follow him -- a male N.D. named<br>
    GARVEY, and female, LIEUTENANT RHODES.</p>
  <p> He crosses up to look out the windows for a moment, but<br>
    finds that it's hard to relax with the guards so close.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    What was your name again?</p>
  <p> RHODES<br>
    Lieutenant Rhodes.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Actually, I meant your first name.</p>
  <p> Jason asks this with a smile, and Rhodes momentarily<br>
    lets down her business-like demeanor.</p>
  <p> RHODES<br>
    Sandra...</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Well, Sandra... do you think you<br>
    could give me some room?</p>
  <p> RHODES<br>
    We're supposed to be keeping an<br>
    eye on you.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Don't you think you can keep an<br>
    eye on me from over there?</p>
  <p> Reluctantly, Rhodes and Garvey withdraw... Jason turns<br>
    back to the starscape, taking it in. He goes to take<br>
    a sip of his juice but strangely, his hand starts to<br>
    shake -- he tries to make it stop, but it only gets<br>
    worse.</p>

  <p> Not wanting anyone to see, he hurriedly sets the glass<br>
    down on a nearby table.</p>
  <p> Suddenly --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (off-screen)<br>
    Good morning...</p>
  <p> Jason turns to see that Picard has come up behind him.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    I thought you said your ship was<br>
    the safest place I could be.<br>
    (off reaction)<br>
    Why the guards?</p>
  <p> Picard isn't happy about having to divulge the reason.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Because... Bok appeared in my<br>
    quarters last night.</p>
  <p> Jason gives him a wary, surprised look.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It may not have been Bok -- just<br>
    an image of him. We're<br>
    investigating.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Look, maybe you should just drop<br>
    me off somewhere and let me watch<br>
    out for myself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't think that's wise...</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    I've been doing it since I was<br>
    fifteen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know you have. But Bok is<br>
    extremely dangerous. He has a<br>
    starship, technology --</p>

  <p>18 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    All right, all right. I'll stay<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> There is an uncomfortable moment as Jason stares out<br>
    the window, simmering. At his point, the easiest thing<br>
    for Picard would be to leave. But Beverly's question<br>
    nags him, and he tries to hang in there, keep drawing<br>
    Jason out.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You seem to enjoy rock climbing.<br>
    Our Holodeck can create some very<br>
    challenging climbs.</p>
  <p> Jason turns and looks at him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Why don't I take you down there<br>
    and show you how to use the<br>
    programs?</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Thanks. But I can figure it out<br>
    myself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps we could do a climb<br>
    together...<br>
    (off Jason's look)<br>
    I'm probably not as skilled as<br>
    you, but I'm not inexperienced.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    I kind of prefer to climb alone.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    There are other sports programs...<br>
    fending, for example. Have you<br>
    ever fenced?</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Hardly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think it might appeal to you.<br>
    It's very physical... demanding --</p>

  <p>18 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Jason understands what Picard is trying to do... and<br>
    finds the whole situation unbearably awkward.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Look... I'm sorry...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I appreciate what you're trying to<br>
    do. But Captain --<br>
    (shakes his head)<br>
    Captain, father, Jean-Luc -- I<br>
    don't even know what I'm supposed<br>
    to call you... after this thing<br>
    with Bok is over, I'm leaving. So<br>
    when you think about it, there's<br>
    really not much point in our<br>
    getting acquainted.</p>
  <p> Picard is silent. The barriers are still erect.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Let me know when you catch him,<br>
    all right?</p>

    I've scanned your quarters, sir...<br>

    on his console.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (with surprise)<br>
    Captain, I am detecting an object<br>
    five thousand kilometers off our<br>
    starboard bow -- it is another<br>
    probe.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why didn't we detect it before?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It must have been cloaked, sir --<br>
    it appeared out of nowhere.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p> On the VIEWSCREEN we see a PROBE identical to the first<br>
    one Bok sent. Picard and Riker get to their feet and<br>

  <p> He takes the CUP from the slot and when he turns back<br>

    Picard, mirthless.</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    If you want me to stay and talk<br>
    you'd better not call for security<br>

    How do you like your boy, Captain?<br>
    Is he everything you'd always<br>

    It's a risky game you're playing,<br>

    ready for you. Why don't we<br>
    settle this now?</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    How do you propose to do that,<br>
    Picard? You murdered my son.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It was self-defense. He fired on<br>
    my ship.</p>
  <p> BOK<br>

    I'm sorry, but there's nothing I<br>
    can do to bring him back.</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    How touching. But your apology is<br>
    worthless to me. And I demand<br>
    that you repay me for my loss.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (firm)<br>
    You can't put a price on a life.</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    Oh, but you can, Picard. You can<br>
    pay me with your son's life.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> That mirthless grin spreads back over Bok's face.</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    I'm afraid you don't have any<br>
    choice. I insist on being paid...</p>
  <p> Bok spins the chair around a full revolution... when it<br>
    stops and he's facing Picard again he begins to<br>
    DEMATERIALIZE in a strange, new TRANSPORTER EFFECT --<br>

  <p>26 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Jason is sitting up now, recovered but still shaken by<br>
    what happened. Beverly is scanning him with a<br>
    TRICORDER; Picard stands nearby, the guards at a<br>
    distance.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Have you ever had a seizure like<br>
    this before?</p>
  <p> As Jason talks, Beverly starts to prepare a HYPOSPRAY.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Not really... sometimes my hands<br>
    shake... but it's never been that<br>
    bad.</p>
  <p> Jason is shaken, concerned as to what it all might<br>
    mean.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    When did it first start to happen?</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    A few months ago... do you have<br>
    any idea what's wrong with me?</p>
  <p> What's happened has made Jason more vulnerable than<br>
    we've ever seen him. Beverly is gentle but candid.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You have a condition called<br>
    Forrester-Trent syndrome. It's a<br>
    degenerative neurological disorder --<br>
    very rare.</p>
  <p> Jason's face blanches when he hears this --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What do you mean degenerative?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If it goes untreated, it can lead<br>
    to paralysis... even death. I'm<br>
    starting you on a neuro-stabilization<br>
    regimen. If we're<br>
    lucky, we should be able to halt<br>
    the degeneration, maybe even<br>
    reverse it.</p>

    happened.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The disease is hereditary.<br>
    (glances at Picard)<br>
    I know your father doesn't have<br>
    it... was your mother prone to<br>
    seizures?</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Not that I know of.</p>
  <p> Beverly considers what this might mean.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There have been a few reported<br>
    cases where the disease was<br>
    instigated by random mutation...<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I'll run a micro-cellular scan to<br>
    see if that's what happened.</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges with a nod.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing, to Jason)<br>
    In the meantime, I want you to<br>
    take it easy, get some rest.</p>
  <p> Jason nods and soberly EXITS the room... Beverly turns<br>
    to Picard, who's face shows his deep concern.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is he going to be all right... ?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I wish I could say for certain.<br>
    There's no way to know how he'll<br>
    respond to the treatment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there any... facility we can<br>
    take him to -- where they might<br>
    have special expertise?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm afraid there isn't. But I'll<br>
    do everything I can.</p>

    I know you will... I'm sorry.<br>
    It's just hard for me to accept<br>
    that there's nothing I can do...</p>
  <p> Beverly smiles gently.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I understand...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've been thinking about what you<br>
    said the other day. You were<br>
    right, you know. I convinced<br>
    myself Jason didn't want me to<br>
    reach out to him...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Because I don't have the faintest<br>
    idea how to do it.</p>
  <p> Beverly regards him tenderly. Rarely does one see Jean-Luc<br>
    Picard at a loss.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't think anyone is born<br>
    knowing how to be a parent. You<br>
    kind of figure it out as you go.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But nothing I try seems to work.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (a small smile)<br>
    I think anyone who's had a child<br>
    can relate to that.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If there's one quality parenthood<br>
    tends to require -- it's patience.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm just not sure that's going to<br>
    be enough in his case.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I found out he has a criminal<br>
    record. Nothing terribly serious --<br>
    petty theft, that sort of thing --<br>
    but... he's a grown man. Is it<br>
    too late for him to turn around?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's really up to him.</p>

  <p>26 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Maybe. But you can't blame<br>
    yourself for not having been<br>
    there. All you can do is be there<br>
    for him now.</p>
  <p> He smiles back at her. Just talking to the voice of<br>
    experience is soothing.</p>

  <p>27 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Geordi and Data are scanning the room -- Data has a<br>
    TRICORDER, Geordi has the SCANNER that he used in<br>
    Picard's quarters. Picard ENTERS from the Bridge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I think we've found something...</p>
  <p> Data indicates the chair.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Bok was in direct contact with<br>
    this chair for an extended<br>
    period... it is showing a<br>
    distinctive subspace signature as<br>
    a result.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We think he's using some sort<br>
    of... subspace transporter to<br>
    beam aboard the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts with surprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My understanding is that such<br>
    devices were impractical.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Federation abandoned its<br>
    research in the field because the<br>
    technology was found to be<br>
    unreliable... as well as extremely<br>
    energy intensive.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - REV. 02/09/94 - ACT FOUR 37.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    In order to transport matter<br>
    through subspace, you have to put<br>
    it into a state of quantum flux --<br>
    it's very unstable.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The quantum effect would explain<br>
    why our sensors did not detect<br>
    Bok's presence.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It would also explain why he was<br>
    able to penetrate our shields.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What range would this kind of<br>
    transporter have?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In theory it could operate over<br>
    several light years.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That means the probe that exploded<br>
    could have been beamed into<br>
    position from some point outside<br>
    sensor range.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If Bok uses his transporter again,<br>
    we may be able to trace the<br>
    subspace signature and locate his<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges, considers everything he's heard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there any way to keep him from<br>
    beaming aboard the Enterprise<br>
    again?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't think there is...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If he has the ability to beam<br>
    aboard, he might be able to beam<br>
    someone away.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm concerned that he's going to<br>
    try to take Daniel -- is there any<br>
    way we can protect him?</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi consider for a beat.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We could keep a signal lock on him<br>
    at all times... if Bok tried to<br>
    beam him away, we might be able to<br>
    keep him from getting a pattern<br>
    lock.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In order to do so, we would have<br>
    to tie the ship's subspace field<br>
    coils into the transporter system.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> They acknowledge, and Picard turns and EXITS.</p>

  <p>29 INT. HOLODECK/CAVES</p>
  <p> Picard finds himself standing at the base of a<br>
    rockface, which Jason is scaling free-hand -- that is,<br>
    without ropes or other gear.</p>
  <p> Picard approaches Rhodes and Garvey.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Would you mind waiting outside?</p>
  <p> Rhodes and Garvey EXIT. We HEAR the sound of the door<br>
    opening and closing behind them. Picard sees that<br>
    Jason has reached a LEDGE of sorts and pulled himself<br>
    on to it in order to rest.</p>
  <p> He walks over to the foot of the rock-face and starts<br>
    to climb -- Jason watches as Picard expertly scales the<br>
    rockface. He can't help but be impressed by his<br>
    skill...</p>
  <p>30 THE LEDGE</p>
  <p> as Picard pulls himself on to it and catches his<br>
    breath.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Not bad...</p>
  <p> There are small crushed pebbles on the ledge that<br>
    Jason, being a little uncomfortable in Picard's<br>
    presence, might occasionally toss into the distance.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I like climbing. There's<br>
    something about... literally<br>
    having your fate in your own<br>
    hands.</p>
  <p> A small laugh from Jason.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    I know.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I came to tell you that we may<br>
    have found a way to locate Bok's<br>
    ship... this might be over soon.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - REV. 02/14/94 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Jason gives him a surprised look.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    You came all the way up here just<br>
    to tell me that?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I thought it might make you feel<br>
    better.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Thanks.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    That was nice of you.</p>
  <p> There is a slight receptivity in Jason that hasn't been<br>
    present before. Picard decides to take advantage of<br>
    the thaw. Jason has steadfastly refused to talk about<br>
    himself... but maybe there's another way in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jason... after your mother and I<br>
    parted... I lost track of her<br>
    completely.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'd like to know more about what<br>
    happened to her... if you don't<br>
    mind telling me.</p>
  <p> The barriers reset themselves slightly.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Like what?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well... why did you go to Camor?<br>
    It seems an unlikely place for a<br>
    woman and a child...</p>
  <p> There is a brief silence... as though Picard has<br>
    touched a nerve. After a beat --</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    You know what she was like...</p>
  <p> There is a tone in Jason's voice that is new --<br>
    vulnerable.</p>

    See a stray cat -- take it in.<br>
    See someone cold -- give them your<br>
    coat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    That was Miranda, all right.</p>
  <p> Jason takes a breath, hesitates for a moment, as though<br>
    he's not going on. But it's as though talking about<br>
    his mother provides an access to his feelings that<br>
    comes in no other way. --</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    She heard about the children on<br>
    Camor who'd been orphaned during<br>
    the Cardassian war.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (understanding)<br>
    I see...</p>
  <p> JASON<br>

    I was only ten when we went there.<br>
    I remember her telling me about<br>
    all the boys and girls who didn't<br>
    have anybody to take care of<br>
    them...</p>
  <p> This is as much talk as Picard has heard from Jason.<br>
    Picard is silent, listening carefully.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    So she found this big house...<br>
    practically falling apart... and<br>
    started rounding up children.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Eventually, there were over forty<br>
    of them...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    She called it a school. She got<br>
    up before dawn and she went to bed<br>
    after midnight and in between she<br>
    never stopped working. She taught<br>
    everyone to read... she grew<br>
    vegetables in hardpan to feed<br>
    us... and she made sure we knew<br>
    how to sing.<br>
    (wry laugh)<br>
    That was important in a place like<br>
    Camor...</p>

  <p> He trails off. Picard waits.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Then one day... two men attacked<br>
    her... on the street in broad<br>
    daylight... for the food she was<br>
    carrying...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If she'd just given it to them,<br>
    they probably wouldn't have hurt<br>
    her. But she knew we needed the<br>
    food...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    So they killed her.</p>
  <p> Simple words that carry a big wallop.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry...</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Don't be sorry for me. My mother<br>
    made sure we were all tough enough<br>
    to make it.</p>
  <p> Picard realizes that sheer determination covers a<br>
    wellspring of pain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jason... isn't there some way I<br>
    can be a father to you?</p>
  <p> No answer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My father and I were estranged...<br>
    he thought I should stay home and<br>
    tend the vineyards and I wanted to<br>
    join Starfleet. He died before we<br>
    could come to terms about it...<br>
    and I've regretted that all my<br>
    life.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I don't want the same thing to<br>
    happen to us.</p>
  <p> Jason is touched by the gesture... but can't shake the<br>
    demons inside him. Anguished --</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Don't you understand? I'm not<br>
    anyone you'd want for a son.<br>

    about me, you wouldn't be trying<br>
    so hard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's not so...</p>
  <p> Jason can't withhold it any longer -- if Picard's going<br>
    to be so blind, so naive, he'll lay it out.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    No? Well let me spell it out for<br>
    you. I've been in trouble since<br>
    I was a teenager... I steal, I<br>
    lie, I use people. I'm a<br>
    criminal. That's what your son<br>
    is.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I know.</p>
  <p> Surprised, Jason turns to him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm aware of your trouble with the<br>
    Camor authorities.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    You are?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It doesn't change anything.<br>
    You're still my son. And, like it<br>
    or not, I'm your father. I don't<br>
    know what that means, but I know<br>
    it means something. That we're...<br>
    connected...</p>
  <p> Picard senses that Jason is listening -- and that his<br>
    words have had an impact.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    (very quietly)<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> A brief silence. Where do they go from here?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    No, sir. The subspace signature<br>

    the knife and puts it to Jason's throat. Picard takes<br>
    aim at Bok just as the N.D Ferengi take aim at him...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lower your weapons or Bok is<br>
    dead...</p>
  <p> It's a stand off -- the Ferengi look at Bok for<br>
    instructions...</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    Lower yours... or your son dies.</p>
  <p> Picard fixes Bok with an even stare --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You know as well as I do, Bok...<br>
    he's not my son.</p>
  <p> Bok is stunned by Picard's words... as is Jason...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know what you did... Miranda<br>
    Vigo is Jason's mother... but, I<br>
    am not his father... it only<br>
    appeared as if I were because you<br>
    resequenced his DNA...</p>
  <p> The Ferengi are as surprised to hear this as Jason is.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But your technique was flawed...<br>
    Jason began to suffer from a<br>
    neurological disorder... when my<br>
    ship's Doctor investigated its<br>
    cause, she discovered what you'd<br>
    done...</p>
  <p> Bok can't believe his plan is unraveling before his<br>
    eyes...</p>
  <p> TOL<br>
    (despondent)<br>
    Now he'll never pay the ransom...</p>
  <p> Picard realizes what Bok has been doing; he addresses<br>
    Bok's crew --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - REV. 02/10/94 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There was never going to be any<br>
    ransom. All Bok has ever cared<br>
    about was vengeance.</p>
  <p> TOL<br>
    Is this true, Daimon?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He is no longer a Daimon -- he was<br>
    stripped of command.</p>
  <p> Bok's anger flares.</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    They had no right to do that to<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> Picard ignores him, keeps working on the others.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He lied to you so you'd help him<br>
    carry out his plan.</p>
  <p> The Ferengi are looking at each other, uncertain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The Enterprise is closing in on<br>
    your position... if you let us<br>
    both go now, you won't be<br>
    attacked.</p>
  <p> BOK<br>
    Your crew won't attack -- not<br>
    while you're on board.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They'll cripple your vessel and<br>
    keep you here until the Ferengi<br>
    authorities arrive.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to the crew.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You'll have a great deal of<br>
    explaining to do... your only hope<br>
    is to turn Bok over to them and<br>
    tell them that he deceived you.</p>
  <p> Tol makes his decision -- he steps toward Bok and takes<br>
    the knife from him at gunpoint. Bok looks at him, he<br>
    can't believe they're turning on him...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - REV. 02/10/94 - ACT FIVE 52A.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Tol explains himself --</p>
  <p> TOL<br>
    (it's nothing personal)<br>
    There is no profit in this for<br>
    us...</p>
  <p> It's over. Picard and Jason exchange a look of<br>
    profound relief...</p>
  <p>44 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it orbits Camor Five.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 47831.8.<br>
    At Jason's request, the Enterprise<br>
    has returned to Camor Five.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - REV. 02/10/94 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>45 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as Picard and Jason make their way toward the<br>
    Transporter room. Jason carries a SHOULDER PACK with<br>
    all his belongings in it.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Doctor Crusher said I'm responding<br>
    well to the treatment... she<br>
    thinks the damage is going to be<br>
    completely reversed...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm glad to hear it...</p>
  <p> Picard is quiet for a beat -- Jason is leaving and he<br>
    wishes he weren't.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you sure you wouldn't like to<br>
    stay aboard the Enterprise for a<br>
    few more days?</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    I can't... I have a life on<br>
    Camor...<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    -- it's a bit of a mess, but I<br>
    want to go back and try to<br>
    straighten things out...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand...</p>
  <p> Although Picard is sincere, even pleased to hear that<br>
    Jason is planning to turn over a new leaf, Jason hears<br>
    disappointment in his voice as well...</p>
  <p> They reach a door and EXIT to --</p>
  <p>46 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard nods a greeting to the N.D manning the console<br>
    as he and Jason ENTER. Jason glances toward the<br>
    platform, then turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Well...</p>
  <p> Picard manages a small nod... Jason is leaving and<br>
    everything feels unresolved to him...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Bloodlines&quot; - REV. 02/14/94 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    Maybe... next time you come back<br>
    this way, you can look me up...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will...</p>
  <p> Picard indicates Jason's shoulder pack.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I slipped a little something into<br>
    your bag while you were packing...</p>
  <p> Jason is a little taken off guard by this... he opens<br>
    the bag and is surprised to find the Gorlan Prayer<br>
    stick.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing, smiles)<br>
    I know you'd prefer a bottle of<br>
    Saurian brandy... but this is all<br>
    I could come up with.</p>
  <p> Jason smiles at Picard's remark, but he knows how much<br>
    this artifact means to Picard.</p>
  <p> JASON<br>
    I... I can't accept this...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I want you to have it...</p>
  <p> Jason nods, extends his hand to shake Picard's. Picard<br>
    takes it... They separate, take a last look at each<br>
    other, then Jason steps onto the platform. When he's<br>
    in position:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Energize...</p>
  <p> Picard watches as Jason DEMATERIALIZES... he stands<br>
    there for a long moment... off Picard's still features<br>
