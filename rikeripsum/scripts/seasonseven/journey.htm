  <p> The ship in orbit around a planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log: Stardate 47751.2.<br>
    The Enterprise has arrived at<br>
    Starbase Three One Zero for a<br>
    meeting with Fleet Admiral<br>
    Necheyev. This visit will also<br>
    give us the opportunity to pick up<br>
    a... member of the family.</p>
  <p>2 INT. WESLEY'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> BEVERLY and WESLEY ENTER from the Corridor. Wesley is<br>
    wearing his cadet uniform and is carrying a suitcase.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Here you go... your very own<br>
    quarters.<br>
    (with humor)<br>
    And they're as far away from mine<br>
    as possible, so you won't even<br>
    have to see me if you don't want<br>
    to.</p>
  <p> Wes rolls his eyes slightly as he starts to unpack.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Mom... you know that's not why I<br>
    asked for my own quarters this --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (teasing)<br>
    No, no. You don't have to<br>
    explain. There comes a time in a<br>
    young man's life when he doesn't<br>
    want to stay with his poor old<br>
    mother... I understand.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; 01/20/94 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (wry)<br>
    I'll come visit you in the old<br>
    Doctor's Home every Sunday.</p>
  <p> Beverly smiles... she's very happy, very up and Wes<br>
    seems glad to be home... but throughout the scene, we<br>
    should get the first subtle indications that all is not<br>
    well with Wesley... he may be smiling and saying all<br>
    the right things, but his smile is just a little<br>
    forced... his good cheer a little hollow. The door<br>
    CHIMES.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> GEORDI and DATA ENTER.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Is there a runaway cadet in here?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If so, we may have to call<br>
    security.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Welcome back, Wes.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Thanks.</p>
  <p> Wesley's response is perfunctory at best and he gives<br>
    them a polite smile.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I was, of course, not serious<br>
    about calling security. It was a<br>
    joke.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I got it, Data.</p>
  <p> Geordi picks up on the distance Wesley is keeping them<br>
    at and he struggles for meaningless small talk.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So... how's life at the Academy?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Great... just great.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But it's... good to have a break.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; REV. 01/24/94 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So do you plan on just lounging<br>
    around while we have work to do?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm... sure I can find some time<br>
    to help, sir.</p>
  <p> Geordi laughs a little at the serious look on Wesley's<br>
    face and then puts a friendly hand on his shoulder.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Enjoy your time off, you've earned<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Thanks.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well... I think we better let him<br>
    settle in.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Good idea. Don't sleep your whole<br>
    vacation away, Wes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; REV. 01/24/94 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Good-bye.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    See you later.</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi EXIT. Beverly gives her son a long hug<br>
    for a moment.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's really good to have you home,<br>
    Wesley. Really.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Thanks, Mom.</p>
  <p> Beverly EXITS. Wes moves back to his suitcase and<br>
    takes out a shirt... then pauses and sits down on the<br>
    bed. He looks around the room for a moment... there is<br>
    no joy in his face, no sense of warm nostalgia or<br>
    relief at being home... just the look of young man<br>
    who's profoundly unhappy... and doesn't even know why.<br>
    OFF his expression...</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>3 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> PICARD is setting a teapot on the table where a small<br>
    tea service has been laid out. There is also a plate<br>
    of small sandwiches, and a tray of odd-looking<br>
    crackers. Riker ENTERS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Admiral Necheyev's just beamed<br>
    aboard. Worf's escorting her up<br>
    here now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> Picard makes a few adjustments to the tea service as<br>
    Riker looks on.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Earl Grey Tea... watercress<br>
    sandwiches... Bularian canapes...<br>
    Are you up for a promotion?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm trying to establish a new<br>
    relationship with the Admiral.<br>
    There's been a certain amount<br>
    of... tension between us in the<br>
    past.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Tension's not the word I would<br>
    use...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'd like to get things started on<br>
    a better note this time. I want<br>
    to make her feel at ease... that<br>
    she's welcome aboard the<br>
    Enterprise...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (innocent)<br>
    I don't know why she wouldn't feel<br>
    welcome here.</p>
  <p> Picard gives him a dry look.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; 01/20/94 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We don't have to like her Wil, we<br>
    simply have to follow her orders.<br>
    However, maintaining an atmosphere<br>
    of confrontation serves no<br>
    purpose.</p>
  <p> The doors now OPEN and WORF and ADMIRAL NECHEYEV ENTER.<br>
    Necheyev is carrying a PADD.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Admiral Necheyev, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles warmly and moves to shake her hand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (warm)<br>
    Admiral, welcome aboard the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> But Necheyev is as brusque as ever.</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    Thank you.<br>
    (to Worf &amp; Riker)<br>
    You two may leave.</p>
  <p> Worf bristles slightly, but Riker simply smiles at her.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you, Admiral.</p>
  <p> Riker gives Picard a big smile... &quot;you've got your work<br>
    cut out for you.&quot;</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf EXIT. Picard tries gamely to play the<br>
    gracious host.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral, may I offer you some --</p>
  <p> But Necheyev is all business... she moves past Picard<br>
    and heads for the table without even hearing him.</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    (brusque)<br>
    I'll come right to the point,<br>
    Captain. A situation has<br>
    developed on the Cardassian border<br>
    that...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; 01/20/94 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> She trails off as she catches sight of the food and<br>
    drink on the table.</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    Are those... Bularian canapes?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, as a matter of fact. I took<br>
    the liberty of speaking to your<br>
    aide, Commander Wrightwell... he<br>
    said you were quite fond of them.</p>
  <p> Necheyev suddenly realizes the effort that Picard has<br>
    gone to here... she reins in her instinctive &quot;cut to<br>
    the chase&quot; attitude with Picard... tries to match his<br>
    gesture with a certain amount of graciousness. But it<br>
    isn't easy -- for either of them, and there is still a<br>
    trace of tension between these two officers as they try<br>
    to remain civil to each other throughout the scene.</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    That was very... thoughtful,<br>
    Captain. Thank you.</p>
  <p> She sits down and takes one of the canapes. Picard<br>
    pours them both some tea.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You were saying something about<br>
    the Cardassians I believe...</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    Yes. The Federation has just<br>
    completed a very long and<br>
    difficult series of negotiations<br>
    regarding the final status of our<br>
    border with the Cardassians.</p>
  <p> Necheyev hands Picard the PADD she brought in.</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    These will be the official<br>
    boundaries... you'll notice that<br>
    a demilitarized zone has also been<br>
    created along the border. Neither<br>
    side will be permitted to place<br>
    military outposts, conduct fleet<br>
    exercises, or station warships<br>
    anywhere in the demilitarized<br>
    area.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; 01/20/94 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (off PADD)<br>
    This border will put several<br>
    Federation colonies in Cardassian<br>
    territory... and some Cardassian<br>
    colonies in ours.</p>
  <p> Necheyev sips some tea... she's not completely happy<br>
    with this agreement.</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    The agreement is by no means<br>
    perfect... neither side got<br>
    everything they wanted... but<br>
    everyone got something. And as<br>
    someone once said, diplomacy is<br>
    the art of the possible.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Those colonies finding themselves<br>
    on the wrong side of the border<br>
    will have to be moved.</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't like the sound of that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The colonists are not going to be<br>
    very happy about that... some of<br>
    them have been there for decades.</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    It won't be easy... but it is a<br>
    reasonable price to pay for peace.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Your mission is to evacuate the<br>
    colony on Dorvan Five.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Dorvan Five... that's where the<br>
    group of North American Indians<br>
    has settled, isn't it?</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    Yes. They've been there for about<br>
    twenty years... they've<br>
    established a village in a small<br>
    valley on the southern continent.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; 01/20/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Picard sits back in his chair... very disturbed by<br>
    this. Necheyev is vaguely irritated -- she doesn't<br>
    respond well to resistance from her subordinates, but<br>
    she holds her tongue and gives him a polite smile.</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    Is there something wrong?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Admiral... centuries ago, the<br>
    North American Indians were<br>
    forcibly displaced from their<br>
    ancestral lands. This group on<br>
    Dorvan Five originally left Earth<br>
    two hundred years ago because they<br>
    wanted to preserve their cultural<br>
    identities.</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    (dry)<br>
    I am aware of that Captain...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There are certain... disturbing<br>
    historical parallels here. Once<br>
    again, these people are being<br>
    asked to leave their homes because<br>
    of political decisions made by a<br>
    distant government.</p>
  <p> Necheyev nearly gives him a tart reply, but instead,<br>
    she takes a sip of her tea... trying to maintain the<br>
    civil atmosphere.</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    An Indian representative was<br>
    included in the deliberations of<br>
    the Federation Council. His<br>
    objections were noted,<br>
    discussed... but ultimately<br>
    rejected.</p>
  <p> Necheyev leans forward, trying to make Picard see the<br>
    validity of her position... trying to make him<br>
    understand.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; 01/20/93 - ACT ONE 9A.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Captain, the Indians colonized<br>
    Dorvan only twenty years ago...<br>
    and at that time they were warned<br>
    the planet was hotly disputed by<br>
    the Cardassians. The bottom line<br>
    is... they never should have<br>
    settled there in the first place.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then perhaps we should not have<br>
    allowed them to settle the planet<br>
    originally. But to go to them<br>
    twenty years later and ask them to<br>
    leave what is now their home...</p>
  <p> Necheyev sits back in her chair and regards him for a<br>
    moment... her expression is weary... tired.</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    I made the same argument to the<br>
    Federation Council. But it took<br>
    three years to negotiate this<br>
    treaty... some concessions had to<br>
    be made... and this is one of<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a moment... realizes the futility of<br>
    further argument.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What if the Indians should...<br>
    refuse to evacuate?</p>
  <p> Necheyev sets down her tea... gives him a direct look.</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    Then your orders are to remove<br>
    them... by any means necessary.</p>
  <p> That grim order hangs in the air for a moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; 01/20/94 - ACT ONE 9B.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (6)</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I understand your... moral<br>
    objections, Captain. If you<br>
    wish... I can find someone else to<br>
    command the Enterprise for this<br>
    mission.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. That won't be necessary.</p>
  <p> Necheyev nods and then she stands. Picard stands as<br>
    well.</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    I don't envy you this task... but<br>
    I do believe it is for the greater<br>
    good.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand.</p>
  <p> Necheyev turns to go, then pauses at the door.</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    And... thank you for...<br>
    (beat, looks down at the<br>
    food &amp; tea)<br>
    ... making me feel welcome.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are always welcome on this<br>
    ship, Admiral.</p>
  <p> A look between two former adversaries possibly on the<br>
    road to a new relationship... and then Necheyev EXITS.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; 01/20/94 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>5 INT. WESLEY'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Wesley is sound asleep in bed. His things are<br>
    scattered across the floor -- not the neat and tidy<br>
    room one would expect from a Starfleet Cadet. The door<br>
    CHIMES. Wes groans and rolls over, trying to ignore<br>
    it. The door CHIMES again. Wesley finally sits up in<br>
    irritation.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (annoyed)<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> The doors OPEN and Picard ENTERS. He's surprised to<br>
    see Wesley still in bed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh. I'm sorry to disturb you,<br>
    Mister Crusher. I assumed you<br>
    would be up at this hour. I could<br>
    come back later.</p>
  <p> Wesley drags himself out of bed and puts on a robe. He<br>
    makes a feeble effort to perk up for the Captain.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No... no, sir. I... must have<br>
    overslept. Come in.</p>
  <p> Picard comes in as Wesley goes to the replicator.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing, to<br>
    replicator)<br>
    Coffee, black.</p>
  <p> We HEAR the sound of the replicator. Wesley seems to<br>
    remember something.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing, to Picard)<br>
    Oh. Uh, can I get something for<br>
    you, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, that's quite all right. This<br>
    was my first chance to welcome you<br>
    back.</p>
  <p> Wesley takes a sip from the steaming mug.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Thank you. I appreciate that.</p>
  <p> There is an awkward beat. The usual warm and familiar<br>
    dynamic between them is noticeably absent.</p>

  <p> Wesley never quite meets Picard's gaze... he's<br>
    withdrawn and evasive. He really doesn't want to be<br>
    here and he doesn't particularly want to talk to the<br>
    Captain -- he just wants to be left alone. Picard<br>
    feels progressively more uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So... how's Boothby?</p>
  <p> Wesley shrugs.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Fine, I guess.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You guess?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I haven't seen him in a while.<br>

    starting to get on my nerves a<br>

    backtrack)<br>
    I mean, I know he's a very...<br>
    insightful... intelligent man...</p>
  <p> Picard's had about enough of this... he can see that<br>
    something's going on with Wesley and that continued<br>
    conversation will only make it worse.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But you'd had enough of his<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    That's not quite what I meant,<br>

  <p> Picard decides not to pursue this any longer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, as I said, welcome back,<br>
    Mister Crusher. I hope you enjoy<br>
    your vacation. That's really all<br>
    I came here to say.</p>
  <p> Picard turns and EXITS. Wesley feels instantly bad...<br>
    he didn't mean to rude... and now it's too late. He<br>
    sits down in frustration.</p>

  <p> Geordi is working at the pool table as Wesley ENTERS<br>
    wearing civilian clothes.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Wes -- there you are. You've got<br>
    to take a look at this.</p>
  <p> Geordi moves over to the warp core chamber. He opens<br>
    a panel on the bulkhead.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; 01/20/94 - ACT ONE 13.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Remember how we always talked<br>
    about improving the quantum<br>
    efficiency by creating a new<br>
    plasma-dyne relay? Well, feast<br>
    your eyes on this.</p>
  <p> Wesley looks inside the panel -- there's a pulsing<br>
    conduit inside. Wesley looks unimpressed -- his<br>
    attitude is condescending, almost arrogant. The<br>
    subtext here is that Wesley is angry and frustrated<br>
    about something and he's taking those feelings out on<br>
    Geordi.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (dismissive)<br>
    You've only got one micro-fusion<br>
    inter-relay in here... the<br>
    converter interface will never<br>
    hold up.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hey, I ran the diagnostics myself.<br>
    This little baby will withstand<br>
    over five hundred Cochranes of<br>
    warp field stress.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I don't think so. You better put<br>
    a secondary phase inverter in<br>
    there.<br>
    (beat, pokes around in<br>
    panel)<br>
    In fact, this entire subprocessor<br>
    matrix needs an overhaul.</p>
  <p> Geordi shuts the panel... he's definitely getting<br>
    irritated at this point.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, I guess we can't have all<br>
    the fancy new equipment they give<br>
    you kids at the Academy. We have<br>
    to make do with what we've got.</p>
  <p> Wesley reacts with irritation, as if talking to a slow<br>
    pupil who just doesn't get it.</p>

    (indicates console)<br>
    A lot of this stuff is almost<br>

  <p>9 INT. MEETING ROOM</p>
  <p> A large room, which in contrast to the rest of the<br>
    village is almost completely 24th century in design and<br>
    in building materials. There is a large, broad table<br>
    with chairs, but no other furniture. Seated on one<br>
    side of the table are five leaders of the Indian Tribal<br>
    Council -- each of them wearing distinctive<br>
    accoutrements which indicate their respective tribes,<br>
    but all in essentially modern dress. On the other side<br>
    of the table are seated Picard and Troi. The<br>
    atmosphere is cordial, but a little stiff. There are<br>
    several PADDS on the table.</p>
  <p> Picard is speaking to ANTHWARA -- the Leader of the<br>
    Tribal Council.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Anthwara... I am afraid there is<br>
    very little I can do. The<br>
    decision regarding this planet was<br>
    made at the highest levels of the<br>
    Federation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; REV. 01/24/94 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WAKASA<br>
    A decision that was made over our<br>
    explicit objections.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I must point out that when you<br>
    first came to this world, you were<br>
    warned that it was the subject of<br>
    a dispute between the Federation<br>
    and the Cardassians. You were<br>
    asked not to settle here.</p>
  <p> WAKASA<br>
    (with an edge)<br>
    Do you know how long we have<br>
    searched for a home? Almost two<br>
    hundred years. Then we found this<br>
    world... Can you blame us for not<br>
    wanting to give it up?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand and respect the long<br>
    journey of your people. But I<br>
    believe we can help you find a new<br>
    home.</p>
  <p> Troi picks up the PADD in front of her and Picard.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    As you can see, there are three<br>
    other planets in this sector that<br>
    have environmental conditions<br>
    similar to those here on Dorvan<br>
    Five. They are all uninhabited...<br>
    and could be colonized<br>
    immediately.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And if those worlds don't meet<br>
    with your approval, then we'll<br>
    find you other choices.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; 01/20/94 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> The Tribal leaders look over their PADDS for a moment,<br>
    then put them aside. Anthwara gets up... moves about<br>
    for a moment... this is not an easy conversation for<br>
    him either.</p>
  <p> ANTHARWA<br>
    You don't understand... the choice<br>
    of this world was not limited<br>
    to... &quot;environmental conditions.&quot;<br>
    There were other... more<br>
    intangible concerns as well.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    My people have always had an...<br>
    intimate bond with nature. We<br>
    think of ourselves as being a part<br>
    of it... and it being a part of<br>
    us. One of the reasons our<br>
    ancestors left Earth two hundred<br>
    years ago was because that bond<br>
    had been severed.</p>
  <p> WAKASA<br>
    (with contempt)<br>
    They began to control the weather.</p>
  <p> ANTHWARA<br>
    We believe -- very strongly --<br>
    that nature should not be &quot;fixed&quot;<br>
    or controlled. Droughts and<br>
    floods... tornadoes and<br>
    hurricanes... these are natural<br>
    events. By putting man above<br>
    nature... an imbalance was<br>
    created. We could no longer live<br>
    in harmony with our environment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can assure you that we will not<br>
    impose a weather control system or<br>
    anything else on your people.<br>
    Whatever world you choose to<br>
    colonize will be completely yours<br>
    to do with as you please.</p>

  <p>9 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> ANTHWARA<br>
    Captain, once the bond between us<br>
    and Earth had been broken, we had<br>
    to find a planet where we could<br>
    establish a new bond... a planet<br>
    that would welcome us. When I<br>
    came here twenty years ago, I was<br>
    welcomed by the mountains... the<br>
    rivers... the sky.</p>
  <p> WAKASA<br>
    (to Anthwara, re:<br>
    Picard)<br>
    He's laughing at you, Anthwara.<br>
    He thinks you're talking about old<br>
    superstition and nonsense.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's not true. I have a great<br>
    deal of respect for your beliefs<br>
    and the meaning they hold for your<br>
    people.</p>
  <p> ANTHWARA<br>
    Then you should respect the fact<br>
    that this planet holds a deeply<br>
    spiritual significance for us. It<br>
    took us two centuries to find a<br>
    place where the mountains gave us<br>
    permission to use their stone for<br>
    our houses... where the rivers let<br>
    us drink from their waters... and<br>
    where the wind sang to us at<br>
    night.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We don't want to spend another two<br>
    hundred years searching for what<br>
    we already have.</p>
  <p> Picard sits back for a moment... this is going nowhere<br>
    fast. Troi senses that further discussion will not<br>
    help.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, may I suggest that we<br>
    adjourn for now... allow us all<br>
    time to think about what's been<br>
    said.</p>
  <p> Picard looks to Anthwara, who nods after a beat.</p>

  <p> ANTHWARA<br>
    Agreed. We will reconvene<br>
    tomorrow.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In the meantime, I would like to<br>
    invite you all to the Enterprise<br>
    this evening as our guests.</p>

    around the room in obvious concern and frustration.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Ever since you came aboard you've<br>
    been moody, sullen and rude. I<br>
    want to know what's going on.</p>

    Nothing's going on, Mom. I just<br>
    want to be left alone.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No, that's not good enough. Your<br>
    behavior in Engineering was<br>
    inexcusable.</p>
  <p> Wesley's voice rises a notch.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Well, then that's my business<br>
    isn't it? I don't need you<br>
    telling me how to behave.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I shouldn't have to -- you're a<br>
    fourth year Starfleet cadet.<br>
    You're expected to have a certain<br>
    level of maturity.</p>
  <p> Wesley gets up, his eyes flash in anger.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Maybe I'm sick of living up to<br>
    other people's expectations...<br>
    maybe I'm sick of following rules<br>
    and regulations... did you ever<br>
    think about that?</p>

  <p>15 PICARD AND ANTHWARA</p>
  <p> Are carrying drinks over to the window. Picard is<br>
    using this social gathering as an opportunity to<br>
    explore other solutions with Anthwara. Midconversation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... so I've been trying to<br>
    familiarize myself with the<br>
    history and traditions of your<br>
    people. I was quite interested to<br>
    learn that it was your grandfather --<br>
    Katowa -- who led the group of<br>
    Indians who initially left Earth<br>
    two centuries ago.</p>
  <p> ANTHWARA<br>
    (with affection)<br>
    He was a... great man. When I was<br>
    a little boy, I was so proud to<br>
    know that he was my grandfather.<br>
    In fact, I think I was a little<br>
    too proud of it... I remember the<br>
    other children getting tired of<br>
    hearing me talk about him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It must have been a very difficult<br>
    decision for your grandfather to<br>
    make... uprooting your people...<br>
    leading them into the unknown for<br>
    an undetermined amount of time...<br>
    not even knowing if you ever would<br>
    find a new home.</p>
  <p> ANTHWARA<br>
    There was great deal of<br>
    opposition. Even my own father<br>
    was against it... but when Katowa<br>
    made his decision -- that was it.<br>
    My father never said another word.</p>
  <p> Picard pauses for a moment, and they both sip their<br>
    drinks for a second.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    It's never easy to leave one's<br>
    home... to give up the safe and<br>
    familiar. But there are times<br>
    when the greater good demands that<br>
    sacrifices be made... I'm sure<br>
    your grandfather knew that.</p>
  <p> Anthwara looks out at the stars for a moment.</p>
  <p> ANTHWARA<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    His grandson does too. But there<br>
    are also times when a people have<br>
    sacrificed too much... when they<br>
    must hold on to what they have...<br>
    even if it means standing up<br>
    against overwhelming opposition.</p>
  <p> A quiet beat and then Anthwara turns to Picard and<br>
    moves the conversation onto a new subject.</p>
  <p> ANTHWARA<br>
    What do you know about your<br>
    family, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A great deal actually. My father<br>
    was a strong believer in passing<br>
    along the family history and<br>
    traditions.</p>
  <p> ANTHWARA<br>
    Tell me about your family. We<br>
    have very strong ties to our<br>
    ancestors... we believe their<br>
    actions guide us even now.<br>
    Knowing more about your family<br>
    might help me to better understand<br>
    you.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Besides, it's always a good idea<br>
    to understand your opponent in any<br>
    negotiation.</p>

  <p> Beverly continues on her way and joins Troi and Lakanta<br>
    in a conversation at the bar. Wesley grabs a drink<br>
    from a waiter's tray and tries to find an out of the<br>
    way place by one of the windows. He manages to find a<br>
    quiet seat by himself and is about to sink into private<br>

  <p> Lakanta sits down next to Wesley.</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    Two years ago, I went into the<br>
    Habak and began a vision quest.<br>
    While I was there, I saw many<br>
    things... talked to many animals<br>
    and spirits... and I saw you.</p>
  <p> Wesley isn't sure what he's dealing with here and he<br>
    tries to make sense of it all.</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There're many things you don't<br>
    understand yet... but you will.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I don't mean to be rude, but I<br>
    wish you'd stop talking about me<br>
    in the future tense.</p>
  <p> But Lakanta is not fazed in the least by Wesley's<br>
    prickliness.</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>

    Wesley. That's why you've come to<br>
    us. We can help you find the<br>

    with puzzlement. He tries to shake off the odd<br>
    encounter, but then he can't... Lakanta's words have<br>
    struck some chord within him... Wesley looks up and<br>
    watches as Lakanta EXITS the room. OFF Wesley's<br>
    thoughtful look...</p>

  <p>19 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Beverly is on her feet, moving about the room,<br>
    obviously very upset and concerned. Picard listens<br>
    patiently, trying to help.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I just don't know what to do, Jean-Luc.<br>
    It's as if someone took my<br>
    son away and left this stranger in<br>
    his place.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In a sense, that's exactly what's<br>
    happened. Wesley left here three<br>
    years ago as a boy... but now he's<br>
    a young man. That can't be an<br>
    easy transition for a mother... or<br>
    a son.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well, it's gone beyond just the<br>
    two of us...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I heard about the incident with<br>
    Geordi.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Have you heard about the Academy?<br>
    (off his look)<br>
    I called Admiral Brand this<br>
    afternoon. She said his grades<br>
    are falling... he's becoming<br>
    remote, defensive... if he's not<br>
    careful, he'll wash out next term.</p>
  <p> Beverly sits down with a sense of helplessness and<br>
    defeat. Picard moves to sit next to her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't mean to make light of that<br>
    by any means... but I must say<br>
    that I went through the same<br>
    thing.<br>

  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD (CONT'D)<br>
    (off her look)<br>
    Oh, yes. I nearly washed out my<br>
    sophomore year... there were a lot<br>
    of different factors... my<br>
    father's death... a teenage love<br>
    affair with the wrong girl... the<br>
    point is, I realized what was<br>
    happening to me and I pulled<br>
    myself out of it. I'm sure Wesley<br>
    will do the same.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jean-Luc... will you have a talk<br>
    with him? Maybe this is the kind<br>
    of thing a boy -- a young man has<br>
    to discuss with another man.</p>
  <p> Picard considers this for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (gently)<br>
    I don't think he wants either of<br>
    us to talk to him right now.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But he needs help.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps. But he has to want that<br>
    help. If he doesn't, then any<br>
    effort on our part might only push<br>
    him further away.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks like she wants to object, but Picard<br>
    presses on.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Let him work this out on his own,<br>
    Beverly.</p>
  <p> Finally, Beverly realizes that Picard is right... she<br>
    nods in reluctant acceptance and leans against him for<br>
    support. He smiles and puts a comforting arm around<br>
    her.</p>

  <p>20 EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY</p>
  <p> Wesley is walking through the village in his uniform.<br>
    He looks a little uncomfortable here... unsure what he<br>
    should be doing or not doing among these people. He<br>
    looks around for Lakanta, but doesn't see him among the<br>
    Indians, who basically ignore him.</p>
  <p> Wesley shakes his head after a beat... he must be crazy<br>
    to have come here... he turns around to leave and then<br>
    sees Lakanta standing calmly nearby, watching him.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    How long have you been watching<br>
    me?</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    Since you beamed down.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Well, I'm here. What am I<br>
    supposed to do now?</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    I don't know.</p>
  <p> Wesley's intrigue is starting to turn to annoyance.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I thought you were going to...<br>
    help me &quot;find some answers&quot;.</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    Yes. But the answers will be to<br>
    your questions.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    What questions? I don't even know<br>
    why I came here.</p>
  <p> Wesley turns to go, but Lakanta's voice stops him.</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    I told you before your spirit was<br>
    troubled. Was I wrong?</p>
  <p> Wesley takes a long beat before he turns around.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; - REV. 01/25/94 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    I don't know about my... spirit,<br>
    but I guess you could say I'm a<br>
    little... troubled.</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    Then perhaps you do have questions<br>
    to be answered. Maybe your<br>
    answers are here... maybe they're<br>
    not. Will it hurt to look?</p>
  <p> Wesley thinks about this for a moment... he takes a<br>
    deep breath... decides to put aside his frustrations<br>
    for the moment and see where this leads.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Tell me about this... Habak. You<br>
    said you had some kind of a vision<br>
    there?</p>
  <p> Lakanta and Wesley begin to walk through the Village as<br>
    they talk.</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    The Habak is a holy place... we<br>
    hold many of our rituals and<br>
    ceremonies there. It's sacred to<br>
    us.</p>
  <p> Wesley nods and they walk for a moment.</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What's sacred to you, Wesley?</p>
  <p> That definitely catches Wes off-guard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; - REV. 01/25/94 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    To me? Uh... well, I consider a<br>
    lot of things... important... I<br>
    respect a lot of things... but I<br>
    don't know if I consider anything<br>
    sacred.</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    Stop.</p>
  <p> They stop.</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Look around us. What do you think<br>
    would be sacred to us here?</p>
  <p> Wesley looks around for a moment... he hesitates.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Well... maybe some of the designs<br>
    on the walls... the necklace<br>
    you're wearing... ?</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    Everything is sacred to us. The<br>
    buildings... the food... the<br>
    sky... the dirt under your<br>
    feet... and you. Whether you<br>
    believe in your own spirit or<br>
    not... we believe in it. So you<br>
    are a sacred person here, Wesley.</p>
  <p> Wesley smiles after a beat... a little embarrassed, but<br>
    intrigued just the same.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I think that's the first time<br>
    anyone's used that particular word<br>
    to describe me.</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    So if you're sacred... then you<br>
    have to treat yourself with<br>
    respect... to do otherwise is to<br>
    desecrate something holy.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; REV. 01/24/94 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Wesley looks at him for a long moment... Lakanta is<br>
    touching on some very personal and intimate things<br>
    here... and Wesley is becoming more and more interested<br>
    in what this man has to say to him.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Is that... what you think I'm<br>
    doing?</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    Only you can decide that.</p>
  <p> Wesley looks away... thinks about what he's just<br>
    said... there's more than a grain of truth in what<br>
    Lakanta is saying.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    Maybe I don't have... a lot of<br>
    respect for myself right now.</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    Then perhaps it's time for your<br>
    own vision quest to begin.</p>
  <p> Wesley turns and looks at him... and we can see that<br>
    Wesley is starting to take this a little more<br>
    seriously...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>21 INT. MEETING ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard and Troi are meeting with the Tribal leaders<br>
    again. The mood is tense -- they've gotten nowhere.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; 01/20/94 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard and Troi exchange an uncomfortable look. Picard<br>
    is very uncomfortable with the position that this puts<br>
    him in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Anthwara... I deeply regret that<br>
    we have not been able to reach an<br>
    agreement.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But, to put it bluntly, I cannot<br>
    take no for an answer.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    This planet will be handed over to<br>
    the Cardassian government as per<br>
    the terms of the border agreement.<br>
    I am very sorry... but you will<br>
    have to leave.</p>
  <p> A tense beat.</p>
  <p> WAKASA<br>
    And if we do not?</p>
  <p> Picard looks slowly from face to face, trying to<br>
    communicate the fact that he means exactly what he<br>
    says.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then I will be forced... to remove<br>
    you... by any means necessary.</p>
  <p> The tension in the room rises another notch. Wakasa<br>
    looks at him with contempt.</p>
  <p> WAKASA<br>
    A familiar threat... from a white<br>
    man.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (firm)<br>
    This is not a racial issue... it<br>
    has nothing to do with ancient<br>
    hatreds... or with the fact that<br>
    we have different colored skin.<br>
    I might just as easily have been<br>
    a Vulcan or Andorian captain. The<br>
    orders from Starfleet would have<br>
    been the same.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; 01/20/94 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard waits to see what impact this will have on the<br>
    Tribal leaders, but they remain impassive and unmoved<br>
    by this. After a long pause, Anthwara stands and moves<br>
    around to Picard's side of the table. He seems relaxed<br>
    and utterly confident.</p>
  <p> ANTHWARA<br>
    We know you won't take us from our<br>
    land, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Anthwara... I may regret doing it,<br>
    but --</p>
  <p> ANTHWARA<br>
    When you first came to us, we<br>
    didn't know why you were the one<br>
    sent here by the Federation... but<br>
    we knew there had to be a reason.<br>
    To us, nothing is truly random.<br>
    So we searched for the true reason<br>
    you were sent. We didn't find it<br>
    until last night.</p>
  <p> Anthwara holds Picard's gaze for a long moment, as if<br>
    waiting for Picard to state the reason himself.<br>
    Finally, Anthwara breaks the moment.</p>
  <p> ANTHWARA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Are you familiar with the Pueblo<br>
    Revolt of sixteen eighty?</p>
  <p> Picard is surprised by this odd reference... he tries<br>
    to think for a moment, but it means nothing to him.<br>
    Troi speaks up.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I am. Several Indian tribes rose<br>
    up against their Spanish overlords<br>
    and drove them out of what is now<br>
    called New Mexico.</p>
  <p> ANTHWARA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Ten years later, the Spanish<br>
    returned to reconquer the area.<br>
    They were... brutal... I would<br>
    use the word savage. They killed<br>
    our people by the hundreds...<br>
    maimed thousands more.<br>

  <p> ANTHWARA (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    One of these killers was named<br>
    Javier Maribona-Picard. Your<br>
    ancestor.</p>
  <p> Picard is clearly shocked... he takes a moment to let<br>
    this information sink in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was... unaware of that<br>
    incident... or of the man you<br>
    named.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But that was seven hundred years<br>
    ago and I don't see how it has any<br>
    bearing on --</p>
  <p> ANTHWARA<br>
    That is why you have come to us:<br>
    to erase a stain of blood that<br>
    your family has worn for twenty-three<br>
    generations.</p>
  <p> Anthwara now heads for the doors and the rest of the<br>
    clan leaders EXIT with him. Picard sits at the table<br>
    for a long moment... stunned by this revelation and<br>
    unsure exactly how to deal with it at the moment.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain... are you all right?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    We should return to the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> They both get up and head for the door.</p>

  <p>22 EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY</p>
  <p> Picard and Troi come down an alley way and then Picard<br>
    stops short as he runs into Worf, who is standing in<br>

  <p> WORF<br>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>23 EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY</p>
  <p> Continuous from Act Three. Picard steps forward to<br>
    confront the Cardassians. A large group of Indians<br>
    watch the following.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> The Gul steps forward. His attitude is blunt and<br>
    hardnosed, but he is not arrogant or obnoxious -- he's<br>
    simply a Cardassian officer sent here to do a job and<br>
    he means to do it.</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    I am Gul Evek.<br>
    (re: Indians)<br>
    What are these people still doing<br>
    here? The evacuation should be<br>
    well underway by now.</p>
  <p> Picard glances around at the Indians -- he doesn't want<br>
    to have this particular discussion out here in public.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    May I have a word with you...<br>
    alone?</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    (annoyed)<br>
    As you wish.<br>
    (to his men)<br>
    Wait here.</p>
  <p> Picard and Gul Evek move off to one side for a private<br>
    conversation as the two sets of security people eye<br>
    each other suspiciously. Picard is eager to avoid a<br>
    confrontation with this man, but he wants to prevent<br>
    events from spiraling out of control.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    It was my understanding that there<br>
    would be no Cardassian presence on<br>
    this world for another six weeks.<br>
    Your arrival here may upset some<br>
    very... delicate negotiations.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; 01/20/94 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    Negotiations? The status of this<br>
    planet has been settled... what<br>
    are you negotiating?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I would be happy to explain it to<br>
    you... but for now, I must ask<br>
    that you and your men leave...<br>
    immediately.</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    We were sent here to make a<br>
    preliminary survey of the<br>
    buildings and equipment being left<br>
    behind. I have no intention of<br>
    leaving until our mission is<br>
    complete.</p>
  <p> Picard can see that Evek is unmovable on this point...<br>
    it's frustrating, but he has very little choice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well... complete your<br>
    mission...<br>
    (his voice hardens)<br>
    But, this is still Federation<br>
    territory, Gul Evek... until that<br>
    changes, this world is under my<br>
    jurisdiction... and I will<br>
    protect it.</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    Is that a threat?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is a fact... and I suggest you<br>
    keep it in mind as you conduct<br>
    your... survey.</p>
  <p> Picard heads back toward Worf and Gul Evek is left with<br>
    something to think about.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>24 INT. HABAK - DAY</p>
  <p> The Habak is a ceremonial chamber of great importance<br>
    to the Indians. The Habak is located in a high tower<br>
    and the only way in is through a ladder leading from a<br>
    hole in the floor. The room itself is rectangular.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; 01/20/94 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Another ladder leads to a hole in the ceiling and<br>
    sunlight pours in from this hole.</p>
  <p> There is a firepit in the center of the room and there<br>
    is a ledge to sit on running along one wall.</p>
  <p> The walls have been decorated with colorful sacred wall<br>
    hangings -- again, the images should reflect the<br>
    mixture of old and new. These Indians readily<br>
    incorporate elements of their 24th century lives<br>
    alongside their reverence for the past. For instance,<br>
    there are traditional drawings of Earth animals that<br>
    fit comfortably alongside drawings of starships and<br>
    other planets.</p>
  <p> Lakanta has just climbed up the ladder and Wesley is<br>
    following him. Wesley reaches the top and looks around<br>
    for a moment.</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    This is the Habak... the focal<br>
    point of our lives.</p>
  <p> Wesley is quiet... respectful... even a touch awed at<br>
    being here.</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Strangers are not welcome here...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Wait a minute. When I asked to<br>
    come here, you said it would be --</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    You are not a stranger. I told<br>
    you, I've seen you here before.</p>
  <p> Wesley moves around the Habak for a moment... curious<br>
    about the place and the symbology he sees.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; 01/20/94 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Wesley notices a ledge with several DOLLS sitting on<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What are those?</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    They are Mansara... dolls<br>
    representing different spirits who<br>
    come to this place.</p>
  <p> Wesley looks at them in curiosity... he is surprised to<br>
    see a doll which looks very familiar.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    This one looks like... a Klingon.</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    Yes. Our culture is rooted in the<br>
    past, but it is not limited to the<br>
    past. The spirits of Klingons,<br>
    Vulcans, Ferengi come to us just<br>
    as the bear, the coyote, the<br>
    parrot. There is no difference.</p>
  <p> Lakanta now moves to a spot on the floor. He picks up<br>
    a basket of CORNMEAL and begins to pour it on the<br>
    ground in an intricate pattern. Wesley stands there<br>
    for a moment, unsure what to do.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What... should I do?</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    Start the fire... then sit... and<br>
    wait.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What am I waiting for?</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    This is your journey, Wesley. I<br>
    can open the door for you, but<br>
    only you can go through it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; 01/20/93 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Lakanta concentrates on the cornmeal again. Wesley<br>
    takes a deep breath, then moves to the firepit and<br>
    begins placing wood and coals in it.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>25 INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard is talking to Necheyev on the monitor. Riker<br>
    sits nearby. Mid-conversation.</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    Is there any indication that the<br>
    Tribal Council will change their<br>
    position in the near future?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> Necheyev sits back in her chair... reluctant, but<br>
    knowing what she must do.</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    Then I see no other choice...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral, I have every reason to<br>
    believe that these people will<br>
    resist any attempt to remove them.<br>
    I strongly urge you to request an<br>
    emergency session of the<br>
    Federation Council. The issue of<br>
    Dorvan Five must be reopened.</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    Captain... I made that request two<br>
    days ago. The answer was no.</p>
  <p> Riker and Picard exchange a glance... that was their<br>
    last hope.</p>
  <p> NECHEYEV<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm sorry... but you have your<br>
    orders. Starfleet out.</p>
  <p> The transmission ENDS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So much for a reprieve from<br>
    Starfleet.</p>
  <p> Picard gets to his feet and looks out the window for a<br>
    moment. A long quiet beat passes as Picard watches the<br>
    stars.</p>

    of my ancestors against his<br>
    people...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you believe that?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, of course not. I respect<br>
    their beliefs... but that can't<br>
    have any bearing on our mission.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But at the same time... I wonder<br>
    if a dark chapter in my family<br>
    history is about to repeat itself.<br>
    (off Riker's look)<br>
    If these people take up arms<br>
    against us... there's no way to<br>
    foresee the consequences.</p>

    Picard to Worf. Will you come in<br>
    here for a moment?</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard moves back to sit behind his desk... a mask of<br>
    duty and obligation covering his feelings. Worf<br>
    ENTERS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf... begin preparations<br>
    to remove the inhabitants from<br>
    Dorvan Five.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker stands... and then EXITS with Worf.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>26 INT. HABAK - DAY</p>
  <p> Several hours later. The firepit is glowing with<br>
    embers which cast strange shadows on the walls and<br>
    ceiling... smoke is filling the room and there is a<br>
    moody feel to this place. Wesley is still sitting on<br>
    the floor across from Lakanta.</p>
  <p>27 WESLEY</p>
  <p> Is showing some signs of strain and fatigue... his<br>
    eyelids keep threatening to close... a layer of sweat<br>
    is covering his entire body... he's on the verge of<br>
    falling over from exhaustion. His eyes close for a<br>
    moment... he opens then with difficulty -- and then<br>
    they widen in surprise at something he sees.</p>
  <p>28 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>

  <p>29 EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> The smoke in the Habak suddenly dissipates and Wesley<br>
    finds himself standing in the Village... all trace of<br>
    sweat on his face now gone... his fatigue has vanished.<br>
    The Village now appears to be a strange, surreal<br>
    place... there are several Indians scattered throughout<br>
    the plaza... some on different levels... and all<br>
    wearing Mansara masks and costumes... no human faces to<br>
    be seen... a BONFIRE is burning brightly in the center<br>
    of the plaza and it throws weird shadows and light over<br>
    the scene.</p>
  <p> Wesley walks through this bizarre scene as if in a<br>
    dream...</p>
  <p> JACK'S VOICE<br>
    Wesley...</p>
  <p> Wesley looks around to see where the voice is coming<br>
    from... he finally can see that there is a MAN standing<br>
    on the opposite side of the roaring fire, but we can't<br>
    make out his face. Wesley begins to walk around the<br>
    fire, and the man moves toward him as well. As they<br>
    both come around the blaze, we can now see that the man<br>
    is JACK CRUSHER -- Wesley's father. Wes stops in<br>
    shock.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Dad...</p>
  <p> Jack looks at him with a calm and kind expression... as<br>
    if it were perfectly natural for him to appear in this<br>
    setting and talk to his son.</p>
  <p> JACK<br>
    You've reached the end, Wesley.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    The end... the end of what?</p>
  <p> JACK<br>
    This journey. The one you started<br>
    a long time ago... when I left you<br>
    and your mother.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You mean... when you died.</p>
  <p> JACK<br>
    You set out on a journey that<br>
    wasn't your own. Now it's time to<br>
    find the path that is truly yours.<br>
    Don't follow me any further.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I... don't understand.</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Dad -- wait!</p>
  <p>31 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> But it's too late -- Jack steps into the shadows and<br>
    he's gone. Wesley takes a step to follow him and<br>
    then...</p>
  <p>32 INT. HABAK - DAY - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Wesley is sitting on the floor of the Habak again, his<br>
    eyes closed as he experiences his vision. He opens<br>
    them slowly to see Lakanta is gone and the fire is out.<br>
    How much time has passed? Wesley blinks a few times,<br>
    trying to readjust to the here and now. He pauses for<br>
    a moment... then gets up and moves to the ladder.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>33 EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY</p>
  <p> Wesley walks through the village... his mind swirling<br>
    with images... sounds... the message from his dead<br>
    father.</p>
  <p> He is in a very passionate... a very vulnerable state<br>
    when he nearly bumps into Worf, who is directing two<br>
    N.D. Security Guards and carrying a tricorder.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    Mister Crusher... Are you all<br>
    right?</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yeah... I'm fine, Worf...</p>
  <p> Worf turns to one of the N.D.S.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (quiet, to N.D.)<br>
    Lay out a confinement beam trace<br>
    along the Southwestern edge of the<br>
    village. Be discreet -- we do not<br>
    wish to alarm the population.</p>
  <p> The N.D. nods and moves off. Wesley frowns for a<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What are you doing?</p>
  <p> Worf glances around and then lowers his voice.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are laying out Transporter<br>
    coordinates for a security<br>
    perimeter. It may become<br>
    necessary to remove these people<br>
    by force.</p>
  <p> Wesley reacts with shock... this was the last thing on<br>
    his mind and it brings up a swirl of emotions. Wesley<br>
    suddenly sees something o.c.</p>
  <p>33A WESLEY'S POV</p>
  <p> A man is standing on one of the upper levels, wearing<br>
    a Mansara mask and costume as seen in Wesley's vision.<br>

  <p> Wesley is coming to a decision as Worf works his<br>

    these people now mean a great deal to him... he has to<br>
    do something.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Worf... we can't do this. These<br>
    people deserve better than to be<br>
    taken from their homes...</p>

    couple of passing Indians.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I understand. But this is not the<br>
    time or the place to --</p>
  <p> But Wesley isn't listening. He's made his choice. He<br>
    turns to the villagers and calls out in a loud and<br>
    outraged voice.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (to villagers)<br>
    Do you know what they're doing?<br>
    They're preparing to beam you away --<br>
    to take you to their ship! You're<br>
    not going to just let them do<br>
    that, are you?</p>

  <p> This causes a stir among the villagers. More Indians<br>
    begin to move in their direction, glaring at Worf and<br>
    the other Starfleet officers. Wakasa is among then,<br>
    and he pushes to the front of the crowd.</p>
  <p> WAKASA<br>
    No, we won't.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Leave. Now.</p>
  <p> Worf and the other N.D.S. are confronted with a large,<br>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>34 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> A fuming Picard is pacing back and forth in front of<br>
    Wesley who is seated at the table.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (furious)<br>
    Inexcusable. You defied the<br>
    orders of the ranking officer on<br>
    the scene... put the entire Away<br>
    Team in jeopardy... and made an<br>
    already tense situation worse.<br>
    Your actions reflect poorly on<br>
    this ship and on that uniform. I<br>
    want an explanation Mister<br>
    Crusher, and I want it now.</p>
  <p> But this time, there is no repentance from Wesley... no<br>
    sign of the boy feeling the wrath of his father figure.<br>
    He keeps his voice level and steady, he's not being a<br>
    petulant adolescent or a rebellious teenager. This is<br>
    a different Wesley Crusher -- he's confident of his<br>
    position and unafraid of the consequences.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (steady)<br>
    What you're doing down there is<br>
    wrong.</p>
  <p> Picard is so surprised at both the statement and<br>
    Wesley's rock steady attitude, that for a moment he is<br>
    caught off-stride and speechless.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Captain, these people aren't just<br>
    some random group of colonists...<br>
    they're a unique culture... one<br>
    that predates the Federation and<br>
    Starfleet...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    That does not change the fact that<br>
    my orders are to --</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I know Admiral Necheyev gave you<br>
    an order and that she was given an<br>
    order from the Federation<br>
    Council... but it's still wrong.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (hard)<br>
    That is not your decision to make,<br>
    Cadet.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Now, I don't know what's gotten<br>
    into you lately, and right now I<br>
    don't care.<br>

  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    But I will tell you this -- while<br>
    you wear that uniform, you will<br>
    obey every order you're given and<br>
    you will conform to Starfleet<br>
    regulations and rules of conduct.<br>
    Is that clear?</p>
  <p> Wesley stands up... looks at Picard calmly for a long<br>
    beat.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, it is.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I'm not going to wear this<br>
    uniform anymore. I'm resigning<br>
    from the Academy.</p>
  <p> Wes takes off his combadge and puts it on the table.<br>
    He holds Picard's surprised gaze for another moment,<br>
    and then EXITS. Picard looks after him for a moment...<br>
    then picks up the combadge and examines it for a beat.</p>

  <p>35 INT. WESLEY'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Beverly is here and she's just as mad as Picard, but<br>
    it's layered with the personal pain and anguish that<br>
    only a parent can feel.</p>
  <p> Wes is now in civilian clothes and he's packing his<br>
    bags... his back to Beverly.</p>

  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Why are you doing this?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I told you, Starfleet's not for<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Dammit, Wesley.</p>
  <p> She moves to the bed and slams down the lid on his<br>
    suitcase. Her eyes flash in anger -- this is probably<br>
    the angriest she's ever been with her son.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I may not be able to stop you from<br>
    throwing your entire life away,<br>
    but you are going to stand here<br>
    and explain it to me first. You<br>
    owe me that much.</p>
  <p> Mother and son glare at each other for a long moment...<br>
    Wesley takes a couple of steps away before answering.<br>
    He tries to take some of the confrontation out of his<br>
    voice, but it's not easy.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    I saw Dad today. He told me not<br>
    to follow him.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at him blankly for a moment, not even<br>
    sure how to respond to that.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You... what?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I... was participating in an<br>
    Indian ritual... I had a vision.<br>
    And in it... Dad came to me. He<br>
    told me not to follow him... that<br>
    I had to find my own path.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (incredulous)<br>
    Is that what this is all about?<br>
    Some mystical vision told you to<br>
    leave the Academy and now you're<br>
    packing your bags?</p>

  <p>35 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's more than that... I think<br>
    I've known this was the right<br>
    thing to do for a long time... I<br>
    just couldn't admit it to myself.</p>
  <p> Beverly thinks about this for a moment... she's trying<br>
    desperately to understand, but it's not easy. She sits<br>
    down on the bed.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But you always said being at the<br>
    Academy was... the best thing that<br>
    ever happened to you.</p>
  <p> These are difficult things for Wesley to admit... but<br>
    if there's anyone he can share them with, it's Beverly.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I know. And for a while it was.<br>
    But as time went on... and<br>
    graduation got closer... I started<br>
    feeling... depressed. I thought<br>
    it would go away... but it only<br>
    got worse.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Why didn't you ever say anything?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I guess I didn't want to<br>
    disappoint you... or Captain<br>
    Picard... or my friends. You were<br>
    all so... proud of me.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'd be proud of you regardless of<br>
    what you were doing, Wes. I love<br>
    you no matter what.</p>
  <p> The bond between the two of them is still there and for<br>
    the moment, the conflict drops away and they both<br>
    search for answers. Wesley moves to sit next to her.</p>

  <p>35 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I know that, Mom. Maybe the truth<br>
    is that I was afraid of<br>
    disappointing myself.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I just never questioned the fact<br>
    that someday I'd be in Starfleet.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But when Dad said not to follow<br>
    him, I just knew he was right. It<br>
    seems... so clear now.</p>
  <p> Beverly takes moment to let this sink in.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Maybe it's partly my fault... I<br>
    never realized the kind of<br>
    pressure we all must've put on<br>
    you... to be exactly what we<br>
    expected you to be...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I don't blame you, Mom. It was my<br>
    decision -- it always has been.</p>
  <p> There is a moment between them as they look at each<br>
    other that re-establishes the bond they've always<br>
    had... and now maybe it's even a little stronger.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You remember the alien from Tau<br>
    Ceti who could control warp fields<br>
    with his mind... ?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (nods)<br>
    The Traveller.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He told Captain Picard a long time<br>
    ago that you were... special --<br>
    like Mozart. That you were<br>
    destined for something...<br>
    different from the rest of us...<br>
    Maybe... this is the first step...</p>

    What are you planning to do now?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Well, for the time being... I'm<br>
    going to stay with these Indians.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Wes... you realize they won't be<br>
    down there much longer. The<br>
    Captain's orders are pretty<br>
    explicit on that point.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I know. But I have to go back...<br>
    even if it's just for a while.</p>
  <p> Beverly nods her head... there is a beat and then they<br>
    hug... Beverly still unsure about the future, but very<br>
    sure about one thing...</p>

  <p> But Wasaka's attention is elsewhere and he silently<br>

  <p> Revealing that there is a tense situation building in<br>
    the plaza: One of the Cardassian Troopers seen earlier<br>
    is being pulled from an alleyway by Two Indians. The<br>

    Trooper is brought out of a building under the guard of<br>
    Two other Indians. His weapon has also been taken.<br>
    Wakasa directs the Indians to bring the Cardassians<br>
    over to the front of one of the buildings.</p>
  <p> WAKASA<br>
    (to Indians)<br>
    Bring them over here.</p>
  <p> Now Worf and his Security Guards ENTER the plaza and<br>
    react to the sight of the Indians and the Cardassians.<br>
    The Indians have surrounded the Cardassians and they<br>
    are clearly in an ugly mood. Worf and his Guards move<br>
    to intercede. Wesley follows the Starfleet officers,<br>
    but hangs back a little... trying to size up the<br>
    situation and unsure what he can really do about it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Wakasa)<br>
    Why have you taken these men<br>
    prisoner?</p>
  <p> WAKASA<br>
    They were invading our homes...<br>
    violating our privacy... this is<br>
    not their world. They have no<br>
    right to be here.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The terms of the treaty do give<br>
    them the right to... survey this<br>
    planet.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; REV. 01/24/94 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WAKASA<br>
    We don't recognize that treaty.<br>
    We're not going to let the<br>
    Cardassians have Dorvan Five. No<br>
    matter what the cost.</p>
  <p> The crowd mutters support for Wakasa's position and<br>
    they start to direct their anger back toward the<br>
    Federation officers.</p>
  <p> INDIANS<br>
    That's right. We're not leaving.<br>
    Get out of here! Go back to the<br>
    Federation and leave us alone.<br>
    This is our home. You're not<br>
    wanted here. etc.</p>
  <p> Worf can see that this situation is rapidly getting out<br>
    of hand. He takes a couple of steps away and hits his<br>
    combadge.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (sotto, to com)<br>
    Worf to Picard. An armed group of<br>
    Indians has taken two Cardassian<br>
    prisoners. The situation is<br>
    extremely volatile. Request<br>
    instructions.</p>
  <p>38 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Where Picard and Gul Evek are listening to Worf's<br>
    report.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stand-by, Mister Worf.<br>
    (urgent, to Evek)<br>
    Have your ship lock-on to your<br>
    people and beam them out of there<br>
    now, before something happens.</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    (outraged)<br>
    My people? What about these<br>
    Indians of yours -- they've taken<br>
    hostages. This planet is ours,<br>
    Captain, and we will not be chased<br>
    away by some unruly crowd.<br>

  <p> GUL EVEK (Cont'd)<br>
    (hits combadge)<br>
    Gul Evek to the Vetar.</p>
  <p> CARDASSIAN COM VOICE<br>
    This is Glin Telak aboard the<br>
    Vetar. Go Ahead.</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    Two of our men on the surface have<br>
    been taken prisoner. Prepare to<br>
    send an armed squad to rescue them<br>
    and to occupy the village.</p>
  <p> Picard moves closer to him... events are quickly<br>
    escalating out of anyone's control.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Gul Evek, those people down there<br>
    are Federation citizens and I am<br>
    sworn to protect them. If your<br>
    troops attack the village, my<br>
    security forces will respond...</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    I hope you realize the<br>
    consequences of Federation<br>
    officers firing on Cardassian<br>
    troops...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I do. That's why we need to stop<br>
    this now, before it's too late.</p>
  <p>39 EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As before. Worf is trying to reason with Wakasa, but<br>
    the tension level is steadily rising.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I cannot allow you to hold these<br>
    men as prisoners.</p>
  <p> WAKASA<br>
    You have no authority here.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, in the flash of an eye, one of the Cardassian<br>
    troopers takes advantage of the distraction of Worf and<br>
    Wakasa and GRABS a PHASER from one of the Indians. He<br>
    whips it up and FIRES at an Indian.</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I don't understand...</p>
  <p> LAKANTA<br>
    You've found a new beginning for<br>
    yourself... the first steps on a<br>
    journey that few humans will ever<br>
    take.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Who are you?</p>
  <p> Lakanta smiles and then suddenly TRANSFORMS into<br>
    another person -- the TRAVELLER.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing, shocked)<br>
    The Traveller...</p>
  <p> TRAVELLER<br>
    I've been waiting a long time for<br>
    this moment, Wesley.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    So my experience in the Habak...<br>
    my vision of my father... the<br>
    things he said to me... those were<br>
    all your doing?</p>
  <p> TRAVELLER<br>
    I merely opened the door for<br>
    you... what you experienced came<br>
    from your own mind... your own<br>
    spirit if you wish.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I hoped that you would open your<br>
    mind to new possibilities...<br>
    (indicates scene around<br>
    them)<br>
    And you did. You pulled yourself<br>
    out of time... don't you see?<br>

  <p> TRAVELLER (Cont'd)<br>
    You've evolved to a new level...<br>
    you're ready to explore places<br>
    where thought and energy combine<br>
    in ways you cannot even imagine.<br>
    I will be your guide... if you'd<br>
    like.</p>
  <p> Wesley is tempted... then looks back at the strange<br>
    setting of the two groups caught in the moment of<br>
    conflict.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What about them? I can't just<br>
    leave them like this.</p>
  <p> TRAVELLER<br>
    They must find their own<br>
    destinies, Wesley. It is not our<br>
    place to interfere.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (anguished)<br>
    But...</p>
  <p> TRAVELLER<br>
    Have faith in their abilities to<br>
    solve their problems on their own.</p>
  <p> Wesley is reluctant... but finally he nods. The<br>
    Traveller smiles and then they both walk away -- and as<br>
    they leave our view, TIME RESUMES. The crowd scatters<br>
    as phaser shots rip through the air.</p>
  <p>40 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard and Gul Evek have now moved to the Bridge and<br>
    are standing near the Tactical station. Riker is at<br>
    Tactical with an N.D. Officer, monitoring the situation<br>
    on the planet. The ship is at RED ALERT and there is<br>
    a sense of urgency in the air.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Cardassian ship is powering<br>
    its weapons and Transporters.</p>
  <p> CARDASSIAN COM VOICE<br>
    This is the Vetar to Gul Evek.<br>
    Our troops are under attack. They<br>
    are requesting immediate<br>
    assistance. What are your orders?</p>
  <p> Picard steps in to make a final appeal.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Journey's End&quot; REV. 01/24/94 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Evek, the last war caused massive<br>
    destruction... took millions of<br>
    lives. Don't send our two peoples<br>
    back down that path... not like<br>
    this. History is in your hands --<br>
    right now. Give us one last<br>
    chance for peace.</p>
  <p> Evek looks at him... Picard holds his gaze and Evek<br>
    tries to fight the instinct building within him to<br>
    fight back.</p>
  <p> CARDASSIAN COM VOICE<br>
    Gul Evek! What are your orders?<br>
    Can we open fire?</p>
  <p> Evek finally hits the combadge.</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    Evek to the Vetar... lock on to<br>
    our troops on the surface... and<br>
    beam them aboard.</p>
  <p> CARDASSIAN COM VOICE<br>
    But sir, they have been fired upon<br>
    and --</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    (harsh)<br>
    Those are my orders. Carry them<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> CARDASSIAN COM VOICE<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    I had three sons, Captain. I lost<br>
    two of them in the war. I don't<br>
    want to lose the last one.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Beam up our Away Team immediately,<br>
    Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>

  <p>42 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Gul Evek, and Anthwara are seated at the table.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Anthwara... I want to make<br>
    absolutely sure you understand the<br>
    implications of this agreement.<br>
    By giving up your status as<br>
    Federation citizens... any future<br>
    request you or your people make<br>
    for assistance from Starfleet will<br>
    go unanswered. You will be on<br>
    your own... and under Cardassian<br>
    jurisdiction.</p>
  <p> ANTHWARA<br>
    I understand, Captain. And we are<br>
    prepared to take that risk.<br>
    (to Gul Evek)<br>
    Will the Cardassian government<br>
    honor the agreement you've made<br>
    here?</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    I believe that I can convince them<br>
    this is an... equitable solution.<br>
    I cannot speak for every<br>
    Cardassian you will encounter...<br>
    but if you leave us alone... I<br>
    suspect that we will do the same.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Will this be acceptable to<br>
    Starfleet Command?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It will take some doing... but<br>
    with Admiral Necheyev's support,<br>
    I think they'll go along with it<br>
    in the end.</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    (stands)<br>
    Then if there is nothing else, I<br>
    will return to my ship. I have a<br>
    rather... long report to write.<br>
    Captain... Anthwara...</p>
  <p> Gul Evek EXITS. Anthwara stands to follow him, then<br>

  <p> ANTHWARA<br>
    I was right, Captain... you didn't<br>

    The Enterprise is preparing to<br>
    leave Dorvan Five. But former<br>
    cadet Wesley Crusher will be<br>
    staying behind. It seems that<br>
    during the crisis, he met... an<br>

  <p>44 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Wesley is saying good-bye to Beverly and Picard. There<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where will you go?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    The Traveller said that my...<br>
    studies will begin with these<br>
    people. He said they're... aware<br>
    of many things... and that I<br>
    could learn a lot from them.<br>

    Just what I needed... more<br>
    studying.</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Thank you, sir. For a lot of<br>
    things.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles and then Wesley turns to his mother and<br>
    gives her a big, heartfelt hug. Beverly's eyes are<br>

    Energize.</p>
  <p> Wesley DEMATERIALIZES. A quiet beat between Picard and<br>
    Beverly. She smiles at him... grateful for him just<br>
    being here. He puts his arm in hers and they head for<br>
