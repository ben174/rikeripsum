    &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode begins with 90 second RECAP of Part I) </p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it orbits the planet.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S V.O.<br>
    Acting Captain's Log,<br>
    Supplemental: The skeleton crew<br>
    left on board the Enterprise is<br>
    unable to help in the search for<br>
    Commander Data. The planet's<br>
    unusual EM field is interfering<br>
    with the ship's sensors, severely<br>
    limiting their effectiveness.</p>
  <p>2 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Since we have only the skeleton crew the Bridge is<br>
    slightly undermanned. BEVERLY stands at an Aft Station<br>
    studying the sensors. There is a young woman, TAITT,<br>
    at Tactical.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Without our sensors, we're sitting<br>
    ducks. A Borg ship could be right<br>
    on top of us before we knew it...<br>
    (turns to Tactical)<br>
    Ensign, we need to modify the<br>
    sensor array to filter out these<br>
    EM pulses. Can you do that?</p>
  <p> Taitt turns to her. She is young -- not long out of<br>
    the Academy, from the looks of it -- eager to please,<br>
    and a little nervous. There is a hesitation before she<br>
    answers.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    Yes, sir.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I think so.</p>
  <p> Taitt begins to work the controls and Beverly can't<br>
    help but smile to herself. Gently --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - 6/24/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What's your name?</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    Taitt, sir.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't think I've seen you<br>
    before.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    I was just posted here six weeks<br>
    ago.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well, Taitt -- I'll bet you never<br>
    thought you'd be serving as<br>
    Tactical Officer after only six<br>
    weeks.</p>
  <p> Taitt looks up at her, grateful for the understanding<br>
    of her predicament she hears in Beverly's voice.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    No, sir, I sure didn't.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I think I've filtered out some of<br>
    the sensor noise. I'll bring the<br>
    modifications on line.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (approvingly)<br>
    Good work.</p>
  <p> Beverly starts crossing down toward the Command Area<br>
    when Riker's voice comes in over the Com:</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Riker to Enterprise.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Go ahead, Wil.</p>
  <p> INTERCUT BRIDGE WITH:</p>
  <p>3 EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE</p>
  <p> RIKER, WORF and two N.D.s.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can't contact the Captain.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - 6/24/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER (Cont'd)<br>
    It might just be the interference,<br>
    but I'd like to be sure.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Understood.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Enterprise to Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> No response. Taitt starts working her console.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Crusher to Picard.</p>
  <p> Still no answer.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    (off console)<br>
    I'm not getting a Com signal from<br>
    anyone on the Captain's team.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The last time they checked-in they<br>
    were investigating a structure in<br>
    section gamma two-five.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, Taitt reacts to something on her readout.<br>
    She looks a little pale.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    Sir, I'm picking up a vessel<br>
    closing in on our location.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Is it a Borg ship?</p>
  <p> Taitt fumbles at the controls. This is all unfamiliar<br>
    to her.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    It... it seems to match the<br>
    configuration of a ship The<br>
    Enterprise encountered... at<br>
    Ohniaka Three...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Red Alert. How long before<br>
    they're in weapons range?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - 6/24/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    Ahh... about... ninety seconds.<br>
    No -- no, make that seventy<br>
    seconds.</p>
  <p> Taitt is nervous and having to work hard to hold<br>
    herself together. She does not inspire confidence.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Crusher to Transporter Room Three.</p>
  <p> SALAZAR'S VOICE<br>
    Salazar here, sir.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Start transporting the Away Teams<br>
    off the surface.</p>
  <p> SALAZAR'S VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Use the transporters in the cargo<br>
    bays if you have to. I want those<br>
    teams up here as fast as possible.</p>
  <p>4 ON THE SURFACE</p>
  <p> In the b.g. we see two N.D. 's of his team, and another<br>
    team more at a distance.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to an N.D.)<br>
    Armstrong, you and the others get<br>
    ready to beam up.<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Beverly, Worf and I will stay here<br>
    and look for the Captain's team.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm not going to leave you down<br>
    there --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (firm)<br>
    Pull as many people off the<br>
    surface as you can and get back to<br>
    the transwarp conduit. The<br>
    Captain's orders were to get the<br>
    Enterprise to Federation space.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - 6/24/93 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Beverly has no choice but to back off.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Acknowledged.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Riker, out.</p>
  <p> END INTERCUT ON BRIDGE.</p>
  <p> Beverly accepts what she has to do, but she doesn't<br>
    like it one bit.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to con officer)<br>
    Prepare to leave orbit.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    Sir, the Borg ship is powering up<br>
    its forward weapons array.<br>
    They'll be in firing range in...<br>
    in twenty seconds.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Salazar, how many people are still<br>
    down there?</p>
  <p>5 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (INTERCUT)</p>
  <p> SALAZAR, a young NCO, is at the controls. We can see<br>
    several Away Teams stepping off the Transporter pad.</p>
  <p> SALAZAR<br>
    Seventy-three, sir.</p>
  <p> On the Bridge, Beverly moves toward the Viewscreen.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Put the Borg ship on screen.</p>
  <p>6 ANGLE - VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Borg ship is bearing down in the distance.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    Should I raise shields, sir?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not yet. I want to keep bringing<br>
    people up until the last possible<br>
    second.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - 6/24/93 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Everyone reacts to Beverly's order; she's cutting it<br>
    close, but if she pulls it off she'll have gotten that<br>
    many more people off the surface.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    Ten seconds.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Stand by to raise shields and<br>
    break orbit on my mark.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    Five seconds.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Mark.</p>
  <p>7 ANGLE - VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Borg ship fires at the Enterprise. The Enterprise<br>
    is rocked by the blast.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    Shields are down to seventy<br>
    percent.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Establish a frequency-shift firing<br>
    pattern and return fire.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    Ah... right.</p>
  <p> On the Viewscreen, we see the Borg ship taking a direct<br>
    hit as the Enterprise passes above it and continues<br>
    away.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    Direct hit... no damage.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Helm, set course for the conduit,<br>
    maximum warp.</p>

  <p>9 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it flashes away.</p>
  <p>10 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    The Borg aren't following us, sir.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Salazar, how many people did we<br>
    leave behind?</p>
  <p>11 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Where we see more Away Teams stepping off the Pad and<br>
    filing out the door.</p>
  <p> SALAZAR<br>
    Forty-seven, sir.</p>
  <p>12 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Beverly is not happy about this. Her frustration<br>
    shows.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to herself)<br>
    Another minute and we could have<br>
    had them...</p>
  <p>13 EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf are now alone, the two N.D.s having been<br>
    evacuated. The planet's surface suddenly seems that<br>
    much more vast and desolate.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (hits combadge)<br>
    Riker to any team leader.</p>
  <p> POWELL'S VOICE<br>
    Lieutenant Powell here, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Round up everyone who was left<br>
    behind. Take cover and try to<br>
    avoid any contact with the Borg.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - 6/24/93 - TEASER 8.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> POWELL'S VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Riker, out.</p>
  <p> Riker turns to Worf.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Even if Beverly gets back to<br>
    Federation space, it'll be a few<br>
    days before Starfleet can get any<br>
    ships here... until then, we're<br>
    on our own.</p>
  <p> They both know they're facing pretty stiff odds. Off<br>
    their grim expressions...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/25/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>14 INT. BORG HALL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> LORE is moving through the crowd of Borg that still<br>
    surround PICARD, TROI, and GEORDI. DATA is nearby, as<br>
    is CROSIS.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    What do you think of my followers,<br>
    Picard? Impressive, aren't they?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not particularly impressed.<br>
    You've simply taught them to enjoy<br>
    killing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are wrong, Captain. My<br>
    brother and I serve a much higher<br>
    purpose.</p>
  <p> Troi stares at Data, noticing something unusual.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Data... I can sense feelings in<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. My brother has made it<br>
    possible.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (realizing)<br>
    He gave you the chip -- the one<br>
    Doctor Soong made for you.</p>
  <p> But this produces only a merry laugh from Lore. During<br>
    the next, Picard's attention is focused on Data --<br>
    studying, inspecting, looking for any clue to his<br>
    unusual behavior.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Oh, no, no. I still have the<br>
    emotional program my father<br>
    designed. I wouldn't want to give<br>
    it up. It's what has given me<br>
    such a strong sense of family --<br>
    an intense desire to re-unite with<br>
    my dear brother.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/30/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Then you're responsible for<br>
    bringing him here.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    He came of his own accord. All I<br>
    had to do was lure the Enterprise<br>
    into investigating those attacks<br>
    we staged. Once the Borg told him<br>
    about my plans, I knew Data would<br>
    want to join me.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    You mean... you attacked those<br>
    outposts... killed all those<br>
    people... just to get Data here<br>
    with you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How did he do it, Data? What made<br>
    you decide to come here?</p>
  <p> Lore has noticed Picard ignoring him, focusing on Data.<br>
    Nettled, he grabs Picard's arm and turns him away from<br>
    Data, toward him.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    I am talking to you, Picard. I<br>
    will tell you what you need to<br>
    know.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're controlling him. And<br>
    you've corrupted the Borg.</p>
  <p> Lore stares at Picard, anger draining, shaking his head<br>
    sadly.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    You simply don't understand.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/30/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    You have no idea what has happened<br>
    here. How I found my true<br>
    calling... how the Borg found<br>
    something to believe in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'd like to learn about it. But<br>
    I want Data to tell us.</p>
  <p> This produces another flare in Lore.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    I told you -- I will tell you what<br>
    you need to know.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How do you like that, Data? He<br>
    won't even let you talk.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Do not try to drive a wedge<br>
    between us, Captain. I am loyal<br>
    to my brother.</p>
  <p> Lore beams at this. But even during the next, Picard<br>
    continues to focus on Data, watching him and ignoring<br>
    Lore.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    You see, Picard? He's not your<br>
    pawn anymore. I've helped him<br>
    break free --<br>
    (gesture to Borg)<br>
    -- just as I've helped them.</p>
  <p> Lore begins moving through the Borg, wound up now and<br>
    enjoying being center stage. He is putting on a show,<br>
    not just for Picard and crew, but for his faithful<br>
    followers.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - 6/24/93 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Look at them. Look at what I've<br>
    helped them become. They're no<br>
    longer mindless automatons.<br>
    They're passionate. Alive.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Are you saying you caused them to<br>
    become individuals?</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    No. You and your friends did<br>
    that. All I did was clean up the<br>
    mess you made when that Borg you<br>
    befriended returned to his ship.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Hugh interfaced with the others<br>
    and transferred his sense of<br>
    individuality to them. It almost<br>
    destroyed them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, do you remember when Hugh<br>
    was on the Enterprise? Do you<br>
    remember what you were like then?</p>
  <p> Lore moves to step directly in front of Picard, forcing<br>
    his attention.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    That doesn't matter.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It does to me. I want to know<br>
    what's happened to Data.</p>
  <p> Lore seethes at this, has to struggle to control his<br>
    temper.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/30/93 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    What's important is what I've done<br>
    here. I've found my calling,<br>
    Picard. I know now why I was<br>
    created. And no one can ever take<br>
    that away from me.</p>
  <p> He gestures to the Borg.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Without me, they would have<br>
    perished. When I stumbled on<br>
    their ship, they were lost,<br>
    disoriented -- they had no idea<br>
    how to function as individuals.<br>
    They couldn't even navigate their<br>
    vessel. They had lost their sense<br>
    of purpose.</p>
  <p> He turns back to Picard, drilling into him.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    I gave them that purpose. And<br>
    they gave me mine.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Borg aspire to the perfection<br>
    my Brother and I represent: fully<br>
    artificial life forms. We are<br>
    their future.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    The reign of biological life forms<br>
    is coming to an end. You and<br>
    those like you are obsolete,<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> Lore turns to Data.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Take them, Brother.</p>

  <p>14 CONTINUED: (6)</p>
  <p> Data gestures to a BORG GUARD for assistance, then<br>
    pulls out a Borg-style WEAPON and moves forward to take<br>
    Picard and the others away. Off Lore's approving<br>
    look...</p>
  <p>15 EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE - DAY</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf come to a stop on a ridge that is<br>
    covered by scrub-like vegetation. Worf scans with his<br>
    TRICORDER.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    Still no sign of the structure.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    With all this interference it<br>
    could be a hundred meters away and<br>
    we wouldn't know it.<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    This could take hours.</p>
  <p> Worf sees something off to one side, and takes a few<br>
    steps in that direction.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am detecting a faint energy<br>
    reading.</p>
  <p> Riker moves to him, scanning.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Residual thermal traces... someone<br>
    stopped here...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (also scanning)<br>
    The decay rate indicates they were<br>
    human...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They followed this path...</p>
  <p> They move off, scanning the ground before them.</p>

  <p>16 INT. BORG CELL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data and the Borg Guard are marching the prisoners into<br>
    a brig-like holding cell. Picard and the others have<br>
    obviously been working on Data, trying to assess what's<br>
    happened to him, trying to find a way to reach him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You must realize that something<br>
    has happened to you. The Data I<br>
    know would not be a willing party<br>
    to Lore's plan.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I now realize that my life aboard<br>
    the Enterprise was a waste. My<br>
    quest to become human was<br>
    misguided, an evolutionary step in<br>
    the wrong direction.</p>
  <p> Troi tries another tack.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Data, all I'm sensing from you is<br>
    anger... hatred -- have you felt<br>
    any other emotions?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There are no other emotions.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What about love... joy?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Those are words without substance.<br>
    Love is nothing more than the<br>
    absence of hate. Joy is the<br>
    absence of fear.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - 6/24/93 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Just because you haven't<br>
    experienced certain emotions<br>
    doesn't mean they don't exist..<br>
    Lore is just feeding you the<br>
    negative ones.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Counselor Troi herself told me<br>
    that feelings are not positive or<br>
    negative, it is how we act on them<br>
    that becomes good or bad.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Fine. Then what about the things<br>
    Lore is proposing? What about the<br>
    lives that have already been lost?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You do not understand. In a quest<br>
    such as ours, sacrifices must be<br>
    made. It is regrettable. But the<br>
    greater good must be served.</p>
  <p> Data turns to Geordi.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Give me your Visor.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (disbelieving)<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> Data raises his Borg WEAPON threateningly.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Give it to me or I will take it by<br>
    force.</p>
  <p> Geordi has no choice but to surrender it. He takes the<br>
    VISOR and EXITS the cell. The Borg Guard activates the<br>
    force-field, which FRITZES on and is visible for only<br>
    a moment. Data turns and regards his old friends with<br>
    a cold eye.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am not your puppet anymore.</p>
  <p> He and the Borg guard EXIT. Off our people's concerned<br>
    faces...</p>

  <p> as it drops out of warp.</p>
  <p>18 INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Various N.D. 's are ENTERING the Bridge by the<br>
    Turbolift, taking up positions to fully man the<br>
    stations. Beverly is in the Command Chair, unhappy<br>
    about having to leave crew behind.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    Sir, we've reached the coordinates<br>
    of the conduit. The tachyon<br>
    matrix is energized and ready to<br>
    go.</p>
  <p> Beverly stands and turns to her.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    And Lieutenant Barnaby has<br>
    returned from the surface. He'll<br>
    be relieving me.</p>
  <p> Beverly glances at BARNABY, an older, seasoned veteran.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Right. Stand by to trigger the<br>
    conduit.</p>
  <p> She sees that Taitt is heading a bit dejectedly for the<br>
    Turbolift. A beat, and then --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Taitt.</p>
  <p> She stops, turns back.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'd like you to stay on the<br>
    Bridge. I'll need a Science<br>
    Officer at the Aft Station.</p>
  <p> Taitt blinks, tries not to show her pleasure.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Helm, set a course back to the<br>
    planet.</p>

  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Barnaby reacts to this surprising order.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm not leaving those people<br>
    stranded back there. An emergency<br>
    buoy can transmit a copy of our<br>
    log entries to Starfleet just as<br>
    easily as we can.<br>
    (to Taitt)<br>
    Ensign, prepare a buoy and launch<br>
    it when you're ready.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Lieutenant, open the conduit.</p>
  <p> On the VIEWSCREEN we see the conduit open up in space.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    Launching the buoy now, sir.</p>
  <p> On the Viewscreen, we see a probe-like device entering<br>
    the conduit. Beverly watches the screen for a moment,<br>
    then turns to Barnaby.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Lieutenant, scan for any Borg<br>
    ships between here and the planet.</p>
  <p> BARNABY<br>

  <p> TAITT<br>
    We have to assume the ship that<br>
    attacked us is still in orbit.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How long will we have before they<br>
    can detect us and intercept?</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    If their sensors function as well<br>
    as ours -- it could be as little<br>
    as thirty seconds.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

  <p> SALAZAR<br>
    If I can get a good lock on them<br>

    Is there any way we can use the<br>
    planet as a barrier... to keep the<br>
    Borg from realizing we're in<br>
    orbit?</p>
  <p> BARNABY<br>
    We can enter orbit while they're<br>
    on the far side of the planet.<br>
    (a beat, as he ponders)<br>
    And if we delayed dropping out of<br>
    warp until the last possible<br>

  <p> Barnaby seems to take this as a challenge.</p>
  <p> BARNABY<br>
    Then I'll have to be sure my<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - 6/24/93 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>21 INT. BORG HALL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Lore is talking with an N.D. Borg. Other Borg move<br>
    around the hall going about their various tasks. When<br>
    Lore sees Data ENTER the hall he sends the N.D. Borg<br>
    away and calls out to him:</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (heartily)<br>
    Brother!</p>
  <p> Data approaches with Geordi's VISOR.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Here is the VISOR. May I ask why<br>
    you wanted it?</p>
  <p> Lore slips it over his eyes.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    I thought it might look good on<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> He turns and regards Data with a smile.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What do you think?</p>
  <p> Data looks at him blankly. Lore takes it off with a<br>
    frown.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Maybe we'd better work on your<br>
    sense of humor, Brother.</p>
  <p> Lore begins to examine the VISOR terminals.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Actually, I was thinking that La<br>
    Forge's implants would make him an<br>
    ideal test subject for my<br>
    experiment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    All the Borg you have experimented<br>
    on so far have suffered extensive<br>
    brain damage.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/24/93 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Lore looks up sharply. Is Data going to argue for<br>
    sparing Geordi?</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Using the humans to perfect the<br>
    procedure would allow us to<br>
    prevent any further Borg deaths.</p>
  <p> Lore smiles as he realizes Data is on board.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I understand.</p>
  <p> CROSIS, the Borg who Data left the Enterprise with,<br>
    ENTERS with another Borg, GOVAL. He angrily drags the<br>
    frightened Goval before Lore. The other Borg in the<br>
    hall start to gather as they sense what is going on.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> CROSIS<br>
    This Borg disconnected himself<br>
    from the others. He would not let<br>
    me hear his thoughts.</p>
  <p> Lore doesn't get angry, but shakes his head as if he is<br>
    sorrowful that someone would do such a thing.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (to Goval)<br>
    I've asked you all to remain<br>
    linked to Crosis at all times.<br>
    You know that, don't you?</p>
  <p> GOVAL<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> CROSIS<br>
    (stern)<br>
    This is the third time he has<br>
    disabled the link since he was<br>
    brought here. He should die as an<br>
    example to the others.</p>
  <p> GOVAL<br>
    No -- please --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - 6/24/93 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Lore holds up a hand to stop Crosis.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    I appreciate your vigilance,<br>
    Crosis. With you monitoring the<br>
    thoughts of the others, I can be<br>
    sure they are not falling into<br>
    confusion.</p>
  <p> Lore looks Crosis in the eye as he says this; he knows<br>
    how to make his followers feel special and important.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But Goval has not been with us<br>
    long. Don't you remember what it<br>
    was like when I first found you?<br>
    How bewildered you were?</p>
  <p> Crosis can't deny it. Lore turns to Goval.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I understand how difficult it is<br>
    for you. How uncertain you feel.<br>
    All these sensations are new --<br>
    and they can be frightening.<br>
    Isn't that right?</p>
  <p> Goval responds to Lore's ability to tap into his<br>
    feelings.</p>
  <p> GOVAL<br>
    Yes. I -- have doubts...</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Of course you do. That's only<br>
    natural. And no one is going to<br>
    blame you for that.</p>
  <p> Goval is becoming more relaxed.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But the only way to lose those<br>
    doubts... to keep you from fear<br>
    and confusion... is for you to<br>
    stay linked with the others. So<br>
    their strength and confidence can<br>
    help you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/24/93 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> He approaches Goval, puts his hand on his shoulder.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I need you, Goval. I need you to<br>
    help me build a future for the<br>
    Borg.</p>
  <p> Lore looks into his eyes -- drawing him in, making him<br>
    feel special.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I can't do it without you. Will<br>
    you help me?</p>
  <p> Goval has never been the object of this kind of<br>
    attention -- and from Lore, no less, the leader<br>
    everyone looks up to.</p>
  <p> GOVAL<br>
    Yes... I will...</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Then I need you to be strong. I<br>
    need you to be certain in your<br>
    thinking. Will you stay linked to<br>
    your brothers?</p>
  <p> GOVAL<br>
    Yes. I understand now.</p>
  <p> Lore turns and smiles at Crosis, pleased that he's been<br>
    able to solidify yet another follower.</p>
  <p>22 INT. BORG CELL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, Troi and the VISOR-less Geordi in midconversation.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Lore must have told Data to take<br>
    my VISOR because he realized I<br>
    could see a carrier wave radiating<br>
    from him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A carrier wave... is that how he's<br>
    manipulating Data?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/25/93 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I think what's happening is that<br>
    Lore is tapping into the chip he<br>
    stole from Doctor Soong. He's<br>
    found a way to transmit part of<br>
    that emotional program to Data.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But the only emotions Data seems<br>
    to feel are negative.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm sure that's intentional. But<br>
    for those emotions to affect Data,<br>
    Lore would have had to disable his<br>
    ethical program first...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can we reactivate it?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (musing)<br>
    If I could generate a phased<br>
    kedion pulse at the right<br>
    frequency, it would trigger Data's<br>
    subsystems and reboot the program.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lore would still be feeding him<br>
    negative emotions, but at least<br>
    Data might listen to us.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I think it's worth a try.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/24/93 - ACT TWO 25.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Geordi breaks their momentum with a hard fact:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (wry)<br>
    So... got any ideas on how we can<br>
    generate a kedion pulse?</p>
  <p> Picard and Troi realize they've gotten ahead of<br>
    themselves -- this isn't the Enterprise with its array<br>
    of technological help. Suddenly, they HEAR the forcefield<br>
    FRITZ OFF. Data comes in and moves to take<br>
    Geordi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where are you taking him?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That's not your concern.</p>
  <p> He takes Geordi's arm and moves him out the opening.<br>
    Picard starts after them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, wait -- let us talk to you --</p>
  <p> But the force field FRITZES on again, bringing Picard<br>
    up short. Without a look back, Data walks off with<br>
    Geordi.</p>

  <p>23 EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf are making their way up a fairly steep<br>
    hill. It is rough going. Suddenly Worf reacts to<br>
    something off to the side, and quickly shoves Riker and<br>
    himself into the cover of nearby bushes.</p>
  <p>24 BORG FEET</p>

    feet march on.</p>

  <p> Worf peers out from under the brush, is satisfied the<br>
    Borg are gone, and gestures Riker out. The two stand,<br>
    brushing themselves off.</p>
  <p> Worf points in a direction away from the path the Borg<br>
    took.</p>
  <p> They head toward it, climbing upward as they do. Worf<br>
    reaches the top first.</p>

  <p> Suddenly, they hear footsteps and muffled voices off to<br>
    one side. Quickly, they move the opposite direction,<br>
    toward some brush (trees, etc.). They move through the<br>
    brush, seeking cover -- when suddenly they run right<br>
    into three Borg holding their weapons trained on them.</p>

  <p>28 INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERNS</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf are being led along a rock-lined<br>
    passageway by the three Borg. There are CARGO<br>
    CONTAINERS and other signs that this place is lived in.</p>
  <p> They are taken into a larger CHAMBER where several<br>
    other Borg are standing silently. They're brought to<br>
    a stop right in front of these Borg, who regard them<br>
    without a word.</p>
  <p> Suddenly a figure steps out from behind them. To our<br>
    people's astonishment, it is HUGH.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hugh... ?</p>
  <p> But Hugh has changed from the last time Riker and Worf<br>
    saw him. He does not welcome them; his words are<br>
    tinged with bitterness and confrontation.</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    Why are you here, Commander Riker?<br>
    Hasn't the crew of the Enterprise<br>
    caused enough damage already?</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>29 INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERNS</p>
  <p> Riker, Worf, and Hugh have moved to another part of the<br>
    chamber and are talking. Hugh has explained Lore's<br>
    takeover of the Borg, and his take on it does not sit<br>
    right with Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You blame us -- for what has<br>
    happened to the Borg?</p>
  <p> Hugh is on the attack, his words tinged with anger.</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    You gave me a sense of<br>
    individuality -- changed me and<br>
    sent me back to the collective.<br>
    You must have known that change<br>
    would be passed on to others.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We considered it. We knew it was<br>
    a possibility...</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    Then you made it possible for Lore<br>
    to dominate us.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I do not accept that. Lore is<br>
    only one man. The Borg could have<br>
    stopped him.</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    You don't know the condition we<br>
    were in when he found us.</p>
  <p> Remembering, Hugh's anger diminishes somewhat; but his<br>
    words still have a bitter edge.</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Before my experience on the<br>
    Enterprise, the Borg were a singleminded<br>
    collective. The voices in<br>
    our heads were smooth and flowing.<br>
    But after I returned, the voices<br>
    began to change. They became<br>
    uneven... discordant.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/25/93 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf listen, rapt.</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    For the first time, individual<br>
    Borg had differing ideas about how<br>
    to proceed.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We couldn't function. Some Borg<br>
    fought each other. Others simply<br>
    shut themselves down. Many<br>
    starved to death.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And then -- Lore came along.</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    You probably can't imagine what it<br>
    is like to be so lost and<br>
    frightened that you will listen to<br>
    any voice which promises change.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Even if that voice insists on<br>
    controlling you?</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    That's what we wanted -- someone<br>
    who could show us a way out of<br>
    confusion. Lore promised clarity<br>
    and purpose.</p>
  <p> Hugh begins to move deeper into the cavern; Riker and<br>
    Worf follow.</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    In the beginning, he seemed like<br>
    a savior. The promise of becoming<br>
    a superior race -- of becoming<br>
    fully artificial -- was<br>
    compelling. We gladly did<br>
    everything he asked of us.</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf listen as they walk the cavern.</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    But after a while, it became clear<br>
    that Lore had no idea how to keep<br>
    his promise. That's when he began<br>
    talking about the need for us to<br>
    make sacrifices.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/24/93 - ACT THREE 29A.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> They are nearing two Borg who are sitting with their<br>
    backs against the wall.</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And before we realized it -- this<br>
    was the result.</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf look at the two Borg. They are horribly<br>
    twisted and misshapen, as if by nerve damage. One is<br>
    constantly wracked by small tremors; the other has only<br>
    one arm.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/25/93 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's happened to them?</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    Lore began to experiment -- trying<br>
    to re-make us in his image.</p>
  <p> Hugh sees that one of the Borg has slumped over so he<br>
    bends down and helps him into a sitting position. The<br>
    crippled Borg manages a smile at this small kindness.</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This is the result of my encounter<br>
    with the Enterprise, Commander.<br>
    So you can see I don't<br>
    particularly welcome your presence<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> Riker looks around the cavern, at the ragged little<br>
    band. There seems to be little our people can say to<br>
    change Hugh's feelings. After a moment --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sorry you feel that way.</p>
  <p> Riker glances at Worf, gestures that they should get<br>
    going.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We came here to get our people.<br>
    I don't want to cause you any more<br>
    trouble...</p>
  <p> Hugh is about to let them leave, but he can't dismiss<br>
    his experience on the Enterprise that easily.</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    Tell me... about my friend.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Friend?</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    The human called Geordi.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/30/93 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I wish I could tell you. We think<br>
    he's being held inside the<br>
    compound.</p>
  <p> Hugh's face changes -- he fears the worst. But when he<br>
    looks around at the others who are hiding here, he's<br>
    torn by his conflicting responsibilities.</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    I cannot help you... I cannot risk<br>
    our being discovered.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Will you at least show us how to<br>
    get into the compound?</p>
  <p> A beat, as Hugh wars with himself, then --</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    (gesturing)<br>
    These caverns lead to tunnels<br>
    which run beneath the compound.<br>
    Some of them connect with the<br>
    environmental control ducts.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Show us. If we can determine the<br>
    geography of the compound, we can<br>
    form a rescue plan.</p>
  <p> Hugh regards them gravely... then turns and heads down<br>
    a tunnel. Riker and Worf follow.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - 6/24/93 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>30 INT. BORG LAB (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A small chamber with alien scientific equipment.</p>
  <p> Geordi is STRAPPED onto a tilting PLATFORM. He's alone<br>
    and can't see. After a moment, Data ENTERS and Geordi<br>
    reacts to the sound.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> Data doesn't answer.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Is somebody there?</p>
  <p> A cold look crosses Data's face.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (Picard's voice)<br>
    Geordi...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (as Picard)<br>
    Shhh. We're getting out of here.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (whispers)<br>
    Hurry. Data was just here; he<br>
    went to get something.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (as himself)<br>
    Too late.</p>
  <p> Geordi realizes Data has tricked him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    My Brother suggested that I try to<br>
    develop my sense of humor. What<br>
    do you think?</p>
  <p> Geordi can't afford to antagonize Data.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I think it needs a little work.</p>
  <p> Data approaches Geordi and uses a (TECH) DEVICE to<br>
    shoot a BEAM inside Geordi's left VISOR terminal.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/29/93 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing, reacts)<br>
    What's happening?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (as he does the right<br>
    terminal)<br>
    I am neutralizing your pain<br>
    receptors.</p>
  <p> Geordi swallows hard and asks in an even voice:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What are you going to do to me?</p>
  <p> Data picks up a (TECH) device that has a long needlelike<br>
    point.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am implanting nano-cortical<br>
    fibers in your cerebrum that are<br>
    designed to learn and mimic your<br>
    neural firing patterns.</p>
  <p> As he speaks, Data calmly inserts the needle-like point<br>
    into Geordi's skull. We're expecting Geordi to cry out<br>
    in pain but he doesn't; he doesn't even feel it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Once they are in place, I will<br>
    destroy your existing brain cells<br>
    and see if the artificial neural<br>
    network is able to take over<br>
    cognitive functions.</p>
  <p> Data removes the point and we see the end of a thin<br>
    FIBER protruding from Geordi's scalp.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data, listen to me. Lore is<br>
    controlling you -- he's<br>
    transmitting a carrier wave that's<br>
    affecting your positronic matrix.</p>
  <p> But Data pays no attention to this.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If the procedure is successful,<br>
    your cognitive processing<br>
    functions will be considerably<br>
    improved.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/25/93 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Don't you care that he's<br>
    manipulating you?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    However, there is approximately a<br>
    sixty percent chance that you will<br>
    not survive the procedure.</p>
  <p> Data inserts the probe into another part of Geordi's<br>
    skull.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't much care for those odds.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    They are cause for concern.</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts -- maybe there's some part of Data that<br>
    still cares about him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    However, since I also have<br>
    Counselor Troi and Captain Picard,<br>
    the odds are that at least one of<br>
    the procedures will be successful.</p>
  <p> Data's cold math makes Geordi realize he<br>
    misunderstood... and that nothing he can say will stop<br>
    Data from methodically performing his grisly task...</p>
  <p>31 INT. CORRIDOR/BORG CELL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A BORG is standing silently at his post, just down the<br>
    corridor from the cell where our people are being held.</p>
  <p> Suddenly he hears the SOUND of the force-field fritzing<br>
    on. As he moves to investigate, the fritzing stops and<br>
    he hears the SOUND of a body falling to the ground.</p>
  <p> TROI'S VOICE<br>
    Help me!</p>
  <p> When he looks inside the cell he sees Troi kneeling by<br>
    Picard's unconscious body. She looks up.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (alarmed)<br>
    He tried to escape -- the force-field<br>
    put him into neural shock.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/24/93 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The Borg hesitates, suspicious.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    If he dies, Lore will blame you.</p>
  <p> The Borg decides she's right. He DEACTIVATES the force-field.<br>
    He enters the cell and approaches Picard's<br>
    body.</p>
  <p> When he bends down to take a closer look, Picard<br>
    suddenly opens his eyes and reaches a hand up to pull<br>
    a TUBE from the Borg's head, instantly disabling him.<br>
    When the Borg slumps to the ground, we see a small<br>
    amount of silvery FLUID seep from the torn tube.</p>
  <p> Picard gets up and examines the Borg's prosthetic ARM.<br>
    He quickly separates the weapon from the Borg's arm and<br>
    gives it to Troi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    See if the corridor's empty.</p>
  <p> Picard stays with the Borg as she moves to the cell<br>
    opening -- she stops short when she sees Data ENTER the<br>
    corridor, holding a groggy Geordi by the arm.</p>
  <p> Data sees the weapon in Troi's hand and grabs Geordi by<br>
    the throat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Drop it or I will break his neck.</p>
  <p> Troi has no choice but to drop the weapon. Data<br>
    unholsters his, then moves Geordi forward and hands him<br>
    over to Picard and Troi.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Take him.</p>
  <p> Picard and Troi lead Geordi to one of the side benches.<br>
    Two Borg hurriedly ENTER. Data gestures to the fallen<br>
    guard and they drag his body from the cell.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/25/93 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (re: Geordi)<br>
    What have you done to him?</p>
  <p> But Data ignores him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will be back for him later.</p>
  <p> With a cold look at Picard, he turns and EXITS. We<br>
    HEAR the force-field go on.</p>
  <p> When Data's gone Picard turns to Troi and opens his<br>
    hand, revealing a small DEVICE that is Borg-like in<br>
    design. They approach Geordi.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Geordi, are you in pain?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No. I'm a little dizzy, but<br>
    that's all.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was able to take part of a<br>
    transceiver from the guard's<br>
    interlink system. It uses some<br>
    kind of phased pulse technology.<br>
    Is there any way we could modify<br>
    it to generate a kedion pulse and<br>
    reboot Data's program?</p>
  <p> Geordi thinks for a moment.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's a possibility.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    See if you can locate the phase<br>
    modulation circuitry.</p>
  <p> Picard sets to work.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'll watch the door.</p>
  <p> She goes to stand by the cell door.</p>

    All right, I've found it...</p>

  <p> TAITT<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Sir, the Borg ship is taking up<br>
    position relative to ours.<br>
    They're going to wait for us to<br>
    come out.</p>
  <p> Beverly casts an eye toward the Viewscreen and sees the<br>
    fiery glow of the corona.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The question is... how long can we<br>
    survive in here?</p>
  <p> Off her face...</p>
  <p>42 INT. BORG CELL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi has been taken away again, and Picard is<br>
    modifying the (TECH) component he took from the Borg.<br>
    Troi is standing so as to block what he's doing should<br>
    anyone look inside the cell.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've done everything Geordi said.<br>
    Now to activate it...</p>
  <p> He makes a final adjustment to the transceiver as:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How are we going to know whether<br>
    the pulse reboots Data's ethical<br>
    program?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll only be able to tell by his<br>
    behavior.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Won't he realize something has<br>
    happened to him?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I doubt it. It's one program<br>
    among thousands.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/24/93 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard has reached the cell opening. He glances down<br>
    the corridor, then sets the transceiver on the floor<br>
    and gently nudges it with his foot toward the force<br>
    field.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I just hope this force field has<br>
    enough energy to trigger the<br>
    pulse.</p>
  <p> The transceiver comes in contact with the force field,<br>
    which ACTIVATES, fritzing continuously.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>43 INT. BORG LAB</p>
  <p> Data is scanning Geordi with a MEDICAL DEVICE.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You know, Data -- I've been<br>
    thinking... about some of the<br>
    times we've had together.</p>
  <p> Geordi is hoping that the re-boot will work, and that<br>
    he can reach Data on a personal level, reminding him of<br>
    what was good about his life before he joined Lore's<br>
    &quot;cult.&quot;</p>
  <p> Suddenly Data gives a VERY SMALL head tilt, so minute<br>
    that neither he nor Geordi realize anything has<br>
    happened.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Like that time we went sailing on<br>
    Devala Lake. Remember that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have a complete memory record of<br>
    that day.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You decided to take a swim... but<br>
    when you jumped out of the boat<br>
    you sank straight to the bottom.</p>
  <p> Geordi can't help but laugh as he remembers.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/25/93 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (matter of factly)<br>
    I did not have enough buoyancy to<br>
    get back to the surface.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (still chuckling)<br>
    So you had to walk over a<br>
    kilometer along the bottom of the<br>
    lake to get to shore.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    One kilometer, forty-six meters.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It took two weeks to get the water<br>
    out of your servos...</p>
  <p> There is a beat, then --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am ready to irradiate your<br>
    existing brain cells.</p>
  <p> Geordi's face falls when he hears this... it seems a<br>
    jarring contrast to the pleasant memory he was sharing.<br>
    He doesn't seem to have reached Data.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    Data... if you ever go back to<br>
    being the way you were, you may<br>
    not be able to forgive yourself<br>
    for what you're about to do to me.</p>
  <p> Data's face is unreadable. After a beat --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am getting some anomalous<br>
    readings from your neural net. I<br>
    will have to do further tests<br>
    before I proceed.</p>
  <p> Data has not even scanned for readings, but Geordi<br>
    can't see this. Data stands.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Someone will come and take you<br>
    back to your cell.</p>
  <p> Data regards Geordi for a moment, then turns and EXITS.</p>

  <p>44 INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERNS</p>
  <p> Hugh, Riker and Worf have returned to the main chamber<br>
    from their reconnaissance. Riker and Worf are laying<br>
    out their rescue plan. Hugh stands to one side,<br>
    listening.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We can use the environmental<br>
    control ducts to get inside the<br>
    compound. They should take us to<br>
    the detention area.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'll have to move fast. If we<br>
    have to stun a guard, the other<br>
    Borg will know right away that<br>
    he's been hurt.</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    When they realize... your escape<br>
    route may be compromised.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'll have to take that chance.</p>
  <p> There is a beat of silence. Hugh is torn -- he could<br>
    offer to help them. But he cannot take the step.</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    Good luck, Commander.</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf nod and head off down the tunnel. Hugh<br>
    stares after them, conflicted.</p>
  <p>45 EXT. BORG COMPOUND (OPTICAL) - DAY</p>
  <p> Data approaches Lore, who is seated, surveying the<br>
    landscape from just outside an entrance to the<br>
    compound. Borg workers come and go as they perform<br>
    their various tasks.</p>

  <p>45 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    There you are, Brother. Have you<br>
    made any progress with La Forge?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is too early to tell if the<br>
    nano-cortical fibers have<br>
    performed their function.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    I suspect none of the humans will<br>
    survive the process... but it's<br>
    their own fault, isn't it? They<br>
    should never have come here. What<br>
    were they thinking?</p>
  <p> Data takes Lore's rhetorical question to heart.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    They came looking for me.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Humans are so sentimental.</p>
  <p> But things aren't so simple for Data anymore -- his<br>
    ethical program is forcing him to think about things.<br>
    As much to himself as to Lore:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I betrayed them. If they die...<br>
    I am responsible.</p>
  <p> Lore looks at him, concerned.</p>

  <p>45 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Why are you talking like this? Is<br>
    something wrong with your<br>
    programming? Perhaps I should<br>
    check your systems.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (firm)<br>
    I do not want you to check my<br>
    systems. I must resolve these<br>
    issues myself.</p>
  <p> Lore eyes Data, wary.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    I think I've made a mistake. I<br>
    don't believe you can tolerate the<br>
    amount of emotion I've been giving<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> His eyes locked on Data's, Lore reaches for one of his<br>
    own fingers.</p>

  <p>47 BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Perhaps I should cut back a<br>
    little...</p>
  <p> Lore adjusts something in his nail and Data seems to<br>
    shudder -- like a junkie coming down off a drug.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    How's that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I... do not like it...</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Ah. Then you prefer having more<br>
    emotions... ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    They give you pleasure.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. Please... I want more...</p>
  <p> Lore lets Data yearn for a moment, then adjusts the<br>
    circuitry as:</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    All right. For now, a little<br>
    more.</p>
  <p> Data is again flooded with negative emotion. It's a<br>
    relief -- like a fix.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you...</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Don't mention it. I just hope<br>
    this has helped clarify things for<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> Data walks off and Lore gazes after him. After a<br>
    moment, he beckons to Crosis, who approaches.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    I am concerned about my brother,<br>
    Crosis. I don't believe he really<br>
    wants to be a part of our great<br>
    future.</p>
  <p> He exchanges a meaningful and ominous look with Crosis.</p>

  <p>48 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise hangs in space inside the sun's corona.</p>
  <p>49 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Light from the sun's corona reflects on the Bridge<br>
    crew. Barnaby and Taitt are at an Aft Station. Taitt<br>
    is working a console, concentrating intently on<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> BARNABY<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    Sir, the metaphasic shielding is<br>
    losing integrity.</p>
  <p> Concerned, Beverly moves to him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Can you stabilize it?</p>
  <p> BARNABY<br>
    No... we won't be able to stay in<br>
    here more than another three or<br>
    four minutes.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Do we have warp engines yet?</p>
  <p> BARNABY<br>
    The last estimate was another half<br>
    hour.</p>
  <p> There is a charged silence. The options aren't good.<br>
    Then --</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> Beverly and Barnaby turn toward her.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    I think I have an idea...</p>
  <p> Beverly is interested. Taitt takes a breath.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/25/93 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    I think... it's possible we could<br>
    induce a solar fusion eruption...<br>
    that would destroy the Borg ship.</p>
  <p> Barnaby stares at her, disbelieving.</p>
  <p> BARNABY<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> Taitt presses on. She's a little nervous about this,<br>
    but nonetheless certain of her idea.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    We'd need to direct a highly<br>
    energetic particle beam onto the<br>
    sun's surface... it should<br>
    produce a superfluid gas eruption.<br>
    If we target the right spot -- the<br>
    eruption would envelop the Borg<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> Barnaby shakes his head, dismissing her. Beverly<br>
    doesn't.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How do you know this'll work?</p>
  <p> There is a hesitation.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    I did my senior honors thesis on<br>
    solar dynamics.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at her, considering.</p>
  <p> BARNABY<br>
    Excuse me, sir, but this isn't the<br>
    Academy. And a student thesis is<br>
    a long way from a workable plan.</p>
  <p> The goad seems to sharpen Taitt, focus her. She<br>
    presses on.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    I've already configured the<br>
    tractor emitters to create the<br>
    particle beam... and I've located<br>
    the target point on the surface...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - 6/24/93 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BARNABY<br>
    If her calculations are off, the<br>
    eruption could encompass us.</p>
  <p> Taitt eyes him.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    Well. I'll just have to make sure<br>
    my calculations are accurate.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Let's do it.</p>
  <p> TAITT<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> She works her console.</p>

    solar flare comes bursting out of the corona and<br>
    engulfs it.</p>

  <p> BARNABY<br>
    She did it. The Borg ship has<br>
    been destroyed.</p>

  <p>54 INT. BORG CELL</p>
  <p> Geordi is lying on one of the side benches; Troi sits<br>
    nearby trying to make him comfortable. Picard paces<br>
    restlessly.</p>
  <p> The SOUND of the force field deactivating causes them<br>
    to look toward the cell opening, where Data appears.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (re: Geordi)<br>
    You're killing him. He won't<br>
    survive another session.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I did not come for him -- I came<br>
    for you.</p>
  <p> He indicates with his WEAPON that Picard should move<br>
    out. Picard glances at Troi, then EXITS the cell.</p>
  <p>55 INT. BORG HALL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard and Data ENTER the empty room in midconversation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... It's not too late. If you<br>
    remove the fibers, Geordi might<br>
    recover.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That will not be possible.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why? Because Lore says so?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It is for the greater good.</p>
  <p> Picard senses that Data's program is working, and<br>
    causing some confusion. He bears down.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/25/93 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>55 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good? Aren't good and bad, right<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What does that program tell you<br>
    about what you're doing to Geordi,<br>
    about what you and Lore are doing<br>
    to the Borg?</p>
  <p> Unlike before, Data has no easy answer. Picard pushes<br>
    forward.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It tells you these things are<br>
    wrong, doesn't it?</p>
  <p> Data's face says he's correct.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    How can actions that are wrong<br>
    lead to a &quot;greater good&quot;?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are attempting to confuse me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, Data. You're not confused;<br>
    you're sensing the truth. Your<br>
    ethical program is fighting the<br>
    negative emotions Lore is sending<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> Data's face is anguished. Before Picard can continue<br>
    Lore ENTERS the hall with a group of Borg.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    There you are, Captain. Thank you<br>
    for joining us. You're going to<br>
    help me in a most important<br>

  <p> Troi is tending Geordi when her attention is caught by<br>
    the SOUND of a phaser blast coming from the corridor<br>
    outside the cell. Having no way of knowing what this<br>
    portends, she listens with some concern to the SOUND of<br>
    hurriedly approaching footsteps. To her relief, Riker<br>
    and Worf appear at the cell door moments later.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Where's the Captain?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Data took him away.</p>
  <p> Worf DEACTIVATES the force-field and hangs back to make<br>
    sure no one comes down the corridor. Riker's face<br>
    registers concern when he sees the shape Geordi's in.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There's not much time.<br>
    (re: Geordi)<br>
    Can he walk?</p>

  <p> Crosis aims to take Hugh out but a PHASER bolt from the<br>
    stage area blasts him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - 6/24/93 - ACT FIVE 57A.</p>
  <p> ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Revealing that Riker and Worf had snuck into the hall<br>
    and were hiding up in the stage area -- they stand<br>
    ready to fire again if necessary.</p>
  <p>66A RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> as a melee begins to erupt, various Borg beginning to<br>
    charge each other.</p>
  <p>66B ANGLE</p>
  <p> as two Borg grapple hand-to-hand. One of them takes<br>
    the other down and moves on toward some other foe.</p>
  <p>66C ANGLE</p>
  <p> as a Borg comes up behind Picard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - 6/24/93 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>66D ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Worf sees and takes aim.</p>
  <p>66E ANGLE</p>
  <p> as a PHASER blast takes out the Borg behind Picard.</p>
  <p>67 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> Lore and Data stand looking at each other across the<br>
    room, strangely still amidst the Pandemonium all around<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> The fighting blocks his line of sight for a moment --<br>
    and before Data realizes it Lore is gone. Data has to<br>
    push past people to follow...</p>
  <p>68 INT. BORG LAB (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Where Data had worked on Geordi. Lore is furiously<br>
    working a console when Data ENTERS.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Lore...</p>
  <p> Lore turns and sees the weapon in Data's hand (although<br>
    it's not aimed at him).</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Be careful with that, Brother.<br>
    Somebody could get hurt.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What are you doing?</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    I have a way out of here. I'm<br>
    willing to forget about what<br>
    happened back there and take you<br>
    with me.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    We don't need anyone else. We're<br>
    Brothers.</p>
  <p> He sees that Data is unmoved by this.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - 6/24/93 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>68 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    I'll give you the chip our father<br>
    made. It contains more than just<br>
    emotions -- it has memories.</p>
  <p>68A INSERT - FINGERNAIL</p>
  <p> As Lore speaks, he surreptitiously opens his<br>
    fingernail.</p>
  <p> LORE'S VOICE<br>
    Memories our Father wanted you to<br>
    have.</p>
  <p>68B RESUME SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Lore activates the circuitry and cuts off the flow<br>
    of emotions -- Data shudders as before, and Lore uses<br>
    the opportunity to go for a weapon on a nearby console.</p>
  <p> Lore whips it around to shoot him and leaves Data no<br>
    choice but to FIRE; the bolt hits Lore square in the<br>
    chest. Lore's systems overload -- TENDRILS of<br>
    crackling energy course around his head, and he<br>
    collapses to the ground.</p>
  <p> Data kneels at his side... the impact of the fall<br>
    caused Lore's head flap to open and his BLINKING<br>
    CIRCUITRY is now exposed.</p>
  <p> Lore looks up at him, his eyes filled with sadness.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am going to deactivate you now.</p>
  <p> Lore speaks haltingly -- he's clearly damaged.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/25/93 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>68B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    Without me, you will never feel<br>
    emotion again.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You leave me no other choice.</p>
  <p> Data uses a TOOL to starts shutting down Lore's<br>
    systems, and the firing pattern of his blinkies starts<br>
    to slow.</p>
  <p> Data pauses before shutting off the last system; he has<br>
    to fight off the feeling of withdrawal.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Good bye, Lore.</p>
  <p> Lore's lost so many systems that his words come out<br>
    distorted.</p>
  <p> LORE<br>
    I... love you... Brother...</p>
  <p> Data shuts down the last system and Lore's circuitry<br>
    stops blinking. He is still, lifeless. Data regards<br>
    him silently, his face unreadable...</p>
  <p>69 EXT. THE BORG COMPOUND (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> seen from a distance.</p>
  <p>70 INT. BORG HALL</p>
  <p> The fight is over. Riker approaches Worf and Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What about Geordi and Troi?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/30/93 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>70 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Enterprise is in orbit.<br>
    They've been beamed aboard.</p>
  <p> There is a murmur from some of the Borg when they see<br>
    Data ENTER the room. He approaches Picard and the<br>
    others.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Lore is no longer functioning.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He must be disassembled so that he<br>
    is never again a threat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's good to have you back, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker turns to Hugh. They regard each other for a<br>
    moment, then Riker smiles.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What made you change your mind?</p>
  <p> Hugh considers for a beat.</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    Perhaps my encounter with the<br>
    Enterprise affected me more than<br>
    I realized...</p>
  <p> Considering his angry words earlier, there is a sense<br>
    that Hugh is aware of the irony of his admission.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What will you do now?</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    I don't know. We can't go back to<br>
    the Borg collective...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And we no longer have a leader<br>
    here...</p>
  <p> Picard regards Hugh for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not sure that's true.</p>
  <p> Hugh's never seen himself that way so it takes him a<br>
    moment to realize that Picard means him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/30/93 - ACT FIVE 61A.</p>
  <p>70 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    Perhaps in time... we can learn to<br>
    function as individuals -- and<br>
    work together as a group.</p>
  <p> Picard nods thoughtfully.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good luck, Hugh.</p>
  <p> HUGH<br>
    Good bye.</p>
  <p> Off this moment...</p>
  <p>71 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it moves at warp.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 47025.4.<br>
    We have returned to Federation<br>
    Space and are en route to Starbase<br>
    two-nine-five. Mister La Forge<br>
    remains under Doctor Crusher's<br>
    care.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/25/93 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>72 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Data is sitting at his desk, petting SPOT, looking at<br>
    a MICRO-CHIP on a glass slide. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Enter.</p>
  <p> Geordi comes in.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hi, Data.</p>
  <p> Data looks up at him, curious.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I just wanted to let you know that<br>
    Doctor Crusher says I'll be able<br>
    to return to duty soon.</p>
  <p> Data understands his intention.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am glad that the injuries I<br>
    inflicted on you are not<br>
    permanent.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (notices slide)<br>
    What's that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This is the chip my Father created<br>
    for me so that I could experience<br>
    emotions. I had it removed from<br>
    Lore's body before he was<br>
    dismantled.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Does it still work?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No. I am pleased to say that it<br>
    was damaged when I was forced to<br>
    fire on Lore.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Pleased? Data, you've wanted<br>
    emotions all your life.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. But emotions were<br>
    responsible for what I did to you.</p>
  <p> Data crosses over to a table.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Descent, Part II&quot; - REV. 6/25/93 - ACT FIVE 63.</p>
  <p>72 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I would never risk letting<br>
    something like that happen again.<br>
    My friendship with you is too<br>
    important to me.</p>
  <p> Data puts the chip in a box and closes it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I wouldn't be much of a friend to<br>
    you if I let you give up on a life-long<br>
    dream.</p>
  <p> Geordi picks up the box.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Who knows? Maybe someday we can<br>
    repair this.</p>
  <p> Geordi reaches up and puts the box on Data's shelf.<br>
    Off this moment...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
