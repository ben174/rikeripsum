    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode begins with 90 second RECAP of Part I)</p>
  <p>1 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As seen at the end of Part I -- DATA, TROI, WORF, and<br>
    GIUSTI in their places. The ship is ROCKED SLIGHTLY by<br>
    the blast from the Mercenary ship.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Direct hit to the port nacelle...<br>
    (beat, then surprised)<br>
    But -- only minimal damage.</p>
  <p> Another SHAKE.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Hit on the starboard nacelle...<br>
    again, no appreciable damage.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Wil must've done something to<br>
    their weapons.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe so, Counselor. It is<br>
    now up to us to... play along.<br>
    (to Giusti)<br>
    Release inertial dampers and cut<br>
    power on decks thirty-one through<br>
    thirty-seven.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Set phasers to twenty-five<br>
    percent. Return fire.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>2 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE &amp; MERCENARY SHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise FIRES on the Mercenary vessel.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - 08/06/93 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>3 INT. MERCENARY SHIP - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The ship is ROCKED. (PICARD, RIKER, BARAN, TALLERA,<br>
    NARIK, and VEKOR as seen at the end of Part I.)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - 08/06/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Continue firing!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (off console)<br>
    We've lost three plasma relays on<br>
    the disruptors. Auxiliary<br>
    power... is not available.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    (exasperated)<br>
    Transfer weapons control to my<br>
    station. There's a way to by-pass<br>
    the relays and feed power --</p>
  <p> The ship is ROCKED again.</p>
  <p> NARIK<br>
    The anti-matter containment unit<br>
    is starting to buckle!</p>
  <p> Tallera moves quickly and smoothly to Baran.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    (urgent, quiet)<br>
    The Enterprise has been badly<br>
    damaged but they still have<br>
    superior firepower. If we remain<br>
    here, we will be destroyed. The<br>
    logical course of action is to<br>
    withdraw.</p>
  <p> Baran doesn't want to go, but another SHAKE convinces<br>
    him. Baran's next words are intended for public<br>
    consumption.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    (loudly)<br>
    We've done enough damage. Narik,<br>
    set course one eight zero, mark<br>
    two one five. Warp six.<br>
    Initiate.</p>
  <p> Narik works the console. Across the Bridge, Riker and<br>
    Picard exchange a slightly relieved look.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>4 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As before.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - 08/06/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GIUSTI<br>
    (off console)<br>
    They're preparing to activate<br>
    their warp drive, Commander.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    Sir. We will not be able to track<br>
    them with our sensors if they go<br>
    to warp. I can still disable them<br>
    before they --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am aware of the tactical<br>
    situation, Lieutenant. Let them<br>
    go.</p>
  <p> Worf glares at the image of the Mercenary ship on the<br>
    Viewscreen as it begins to move away from the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE MERCENARY SHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Mercenary ship leaves the &quot;crippled&quot; Enterprise and<br>
    races away.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - 08/06/93 - ACT ONE 4.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>6 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship hangs in space.</p>
  <p>7 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Worf at Tactical, Troi and GEORDI at the aft science<br>
    stations, Giusti at Ops. Data moves from station to<br>
    station, and people automatically report to him as he<br>
    approaches.</p>
  <p> GIUSTI<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Sensor sweep eight has been<br>
    completed, sir. Still no sign of<br>
    the mercenary ship.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Understood. Begin sensor sweep<br>
    nine using the lateral array set<br>
    to maximum gain.</p>
  <p> GIUSTI<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Data makes his way to the aft stations.</p>
  <p>8 INCLUDE TROI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> On the monitor in front of Troi is a video replay of<br>
    Riker's last Viewscreen transmission from Part I. Troi<br>
    FREEZES the image as Data approaches.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I've gone over every word, every<br>
    inflection, every facial<br>
    response... but I still haven't<br>
    found any kind of code or hidden<br>
    message.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Understood. I agree that the<br>
    probability that such a message<br>
    exists is remote, but I believe we<br>
    should check.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - 08/06/93 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'll keep trying.</p>
  <p> She returns to the console and Data turns to Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Two starships have been sent to<br>
    intercept the mercenaries at<br>
    Yadalla Prime and Draken Four, in<br>
    case they attempt to attack those<br>
    planets.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Very well. Inform Starfleet<br>
    Command that we will hold position<br>
    here until further notice.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    So we are just going to... remain<br>
    here?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. But we will continue to<br>
    pursue all avenues of<br>
    investigation which are available<br>
    to us.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    If we had not allowed them to<br>
    escape, this would not be<br>
    necessary.</p>
  <p> Data thinks about this for a beat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct. However, I<br>
    believe Commander Riker wanted us<br>
    to let them escape.</p>
  <p> Suddenly Geordi sees something on his monitor.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (excited)<br>
    I think I've got something.</p>
  <p> Data moves to Geordi's console. On the monitor is an<br>
    OKUDAGRAM of an intricate series of numbers and letters --<br>
    clearly some kind of code.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I've been studying the com link<br>
    Commander Riker used to transmit<br>
    his command codes.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - 08/06/93 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI (Cont'd)<br>
    I didn't see anything at first,<br>
    but when I ran the transmission<br>
    through a sub-harmonic analysis I<br>
    found this.<br>
    (indicates graphic)<br>
    It was sent on the same carrier<br>
    wave as the command codes.</p>
  <p> Data and Troi look at the monitor.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    It might be the message you've<br>
    been looking for.</p>
  <p> Data sits down at the console and begins to rapidly<br>
    work the controls.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Possibly. I will attempt to resequence<br>
    the signal.<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Begin running a search for a<br>
    decryption key.</p>
  <p> As Data and Geordi work...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>9 EXT. SPACE - THE MERCENARY SHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship comes to a STOP near a large planet.</p>
  <p>10 INT. MERCENARY SHIP - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Baran in command. Picard, Riker, Tallera, Vekor, and<br>
    Narik at their stations.</p>
  <p> NARIK<br>
    (off console)<br>
    I'm taking the engines off-line.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    How long until we can repair our<br>
    battle damage?</p>
  <p> NARIK<br>
    It will take at least five hours<br>
    to replace the anti-matter<br>
    containment unit.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - 08/06/93 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    You have three hours, Narik. One<br>
    minute beyond that and you'll<br>
    answer for it with your life.</p>
  <p> Narik glares at Baran, but has little choice except to<br>
    nod and EXIT the Bridge. Baran turns his attention to<br>
    Riker, who seems lost in thought near one of the<br>
    consoles. Picard is standing nearby.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    I suppose I should thank you.<br>
    None of us would be alive if it<br>
    weren't for you.</p>
  <p> But Riker doesn't seem to appreciate Baran's thanks.<br>
    His tone is bitter and downcast.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (bitter)<br>
    You're welcome.</p>
  <p> Picard moves smoothly in and begins to mercilessly<br>
    torment Riker. In the b.g. Tallera watches their<br>
    interchange with a thoughtful expression.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's wrong, Commander? Starting<br>
    to have second thoughts about<br>
    betraying your comrades... because<br>
    that's what you've done --<br>
    betrayed them... betrayed them in<br>
    order to save yourself.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You were just a second-rate<br>
    officer before... now you're a<br>
    coward and a traitor. How does<br>
    that feel?</p>
  <p> Riker gives him a cool look... then, without warning,<br>
    Riker HITS Picard squarely in the jaw, knocking him off<br>
    his feet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't know. How did that feel?</p>
  <p> Picard's eyes flash and he gets up and moves toward<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - REV. 08/16/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    (hard)<br>
    That's enough.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Galen, get down to the cargo hold<br>
    and check those artifacts.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Move.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker continue to glare at each other, then<br>
    Picard seems to back down and he EXITS.</p>
  <p>11 TALLERA</p>
  <p> Looks from Baran to Riker... thinks for a few beats,<br>
    then EXITS.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>12 INT. MERCENARY SHIP - CARGO BAY</p>
  <p> Picard is checking over a group of NEW ARTIFACTS (a few<br>
    pieces of exotic pottery, ancient weapons, tools, etc.)<br>
    on the scanner pad. Picard makes a note on a PADD and<br>
    takes a relic off the scanner. He begins to examine<br>
    another relic. The doors OPEN and Tallera ENTERS.<br>
    Picard doesn't look up.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (irritated)<br>
    Tell Baran I'm working as fast as<br>
    I can.</p>
  <p> Tallera just studies him without responding... she's<br>
    getting suspicious. Picard turns and looks at her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    I'm trying to decide if you're<br>
    incredibly stupid... or incredibly<br>
    smart. Why didn't you continue to<br>
    fire on the Enterprise when their<br>
    shields dropped?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - REV. 08/16/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard turns back to his work, and as they talk, he<br>
    continues to make complex adjustments to the strange<br>
    equipment -- sometimes hooking up new devices,<br>
    discarding others, etc.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You were there. The disruptors<br>
    lost power.<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Computer, reset diagnostic for new<br>
    sample and begin scan.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    I've watched you handle the weapon<br>
    systems before. You know exactly<br>
    how to by-pass a problem like<br>
    that.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And why do you continue to argue<br>
    with Riker? It should be obvious<br>
    that by alienating him you are<br>
    also alienating Baran, and yet you<br>
    continue to do it. Why?</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Scan complete. Terikon profile<br>
    negative.</p>
  <p> Picard removes the artifact and replaces it with<br>
    another one -- this ARTIFACT has several intricate<br>
    designs on the side and is shaped like a large puzzle<br>
    piece. Picard is deliberately taking a challenging<br>
    attitude in order to maintain his cover and throw<br>
    Tallera off.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (sarcastic)<br>
    I'm touched by your concern for my<br>
    well-being.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    That's not an answer.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - 08/06/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Computer, reset diagnostic and<br>
    begin scan.<br>
    (to Tallera)<br>
    I'm not a prisoner in a Romulan<br>
    labor camp, Tallera. I don't have<br>
    to answer your questions and I<br>
    don't give a damn what you think.</p>
  <p> Tallera studies his face for a moment.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Scan complete. Terikon profile<br>
    positive. Ninety-eight percent<br>
    probability of match.</p>
  <p> They both turn and look at the artifact on the scanner<br>
    pad.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, whatever it is... it looks<br>
    like we've found it.</p>
  <p> Tallera moves to the artifact and looks at it closely<br>
    for a long beat, her expression becomes cool and<br>
    unreadable.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    (touches com device)<br>
    Tallera to Captain.</p>
  <p> BARAN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yes?</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    I'm in the cargo hold. Galen's<br>
    made a positive Terikon match on<br>
    one of the artifacts.</p>
  <p> BARAN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Is he sure?</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    He's sure.</p>
  <p>13 INT. BARAN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> In contrast to the other quarters on the mercenary<br>
    ship, Baran's quarters border on the luxurious...<br>
    overstuffed furniture, gaudy sculpture -- very<br>
    decadent. Baran is lounging in a chair while Riker<br>
    sits on a couch... Baran holds a drink.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - 08/06/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    (excited, to com)<br>
    Good. Bring it here immediately<br>
    and don't let anyone else get near<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> TALLERA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Understood. Tallera out.</p>
  <p> Baran takes a long, very satisfying drink from his<br>
    glass and settles back into his chair.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I take it that's good news.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    Very. It means we've completed<br>
    half of what promises to be a very<br>
    profitable mission... and even<br>
    better than that it means, I'm<br>
    almost ready to get rid of your<br>
    friend Galen.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Really?</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    (nods)<br>
    We have only one more artifact to<br>
    find... and once Galen confirms<br>
    it's genuine, his usefulness on<br>
    this ship will come to a very<br>
    sudden end.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can't say I'm sorry to hear<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> Baran studies Riker closely for a moment... he's not<br>
    quite sure what to make of him... he might have an ally<br>
    here, but Baran is wary and suspicious by his very<br>
    nature.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    I'm sure.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Galen may be a loud-mouthed fool,<br>
    but sometimes he can be very<br>
    perceptive... his observations<br>
    about you for instance.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Oh?</p>

  <p> BARAN<br>
    After what you did at Calder Two,<br>
    I doubt you have much of a future<br>
    in Starfleet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've... pretty much come to the<br>
    same conclusion.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    Assuming for the moment that you<br>
    were no longer my prisoner... what<br>
    would you do now?</p>
  <p> Riker thinks about this for a moment... then gives<br>
    Baran a very direct look.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I guess I'd have to look for a new<br>
    career... there must be a place<br>
    where someone with fifteen years<br>
    of Starfleet technical knowledge<br>
    would be useful.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Do you know of any place like<br>
    that?</p>
  <p> Baran takes a drink... he's not going to rush into<br>
    anything.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    Possibly.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But if there's one thing I've<br>
    learned on this ship, it's to be<br>
    cautious... and not to blindly<br>
    embrace what seems to be good<br>
    fortune. And at the moment, you<br>
    seem like a rather large stroke of<br>
    luck.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I haven't exactly sworn my undying<br>
    allegiance to you, Baran. In<br>
    fact, I'd like to know a little<br>
    bit more about the job.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    Such as?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - 08/06/93 - ACT ONE 12A.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Such as what you meant by a &quot;very<br>
    profitable mission.&quot;</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I thought you Starfleet types<br>
    weren't interested in things like<br>
    profit.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm not exactly... the &quot;ideal&quot;<br>
    Starfleet type.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    No, I guess you're not.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    All you need to know for now is<br>
    that your share could be more than<br>
    enough to insure a very long and<br>
    very wealthy life far away from<br>
    the Federation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sounds promising.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - 08/06/93 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    It is. But if you want that<br>
    share, you'll have to earn it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And you can start by putting aside<br>
    your dislike for Galen and trying<br>
    to become his friend.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts as if this is a particularly unpleasant<br>
    request.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    Galen has allies among the crew...<br>
    they might cause a problem if I<br>
    kill him. I want you to get close<br>
    to him and find out who they are.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Okay.</p>
  <p> Riker stands to go, but Baran stops him.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    One more thing, Riker.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    When the time comes, I want you to<br>
    kill Galen.</p>
  <p> A beat and then Riker nods... OFF his expression...</p>

  <p> Data is sitting at the aft science station as Worf and<br>
    Geordi look on. Giusti at Ops. The monitor screen<br>
    shows an OKUDAGRAM image of a sequence of numbers and<br>
    letters which have been arranged into some kind of<br>
    pattern.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have completed the analysis of<br>
    the signal from the mercenary<br>
    ship. I believe these groupings<br>
    represent bearings and coordinates<br>
    taken from their navigational<br>
    system.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So you think this is their flight<br>
    plan...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. If I am correct, the<br>
    mercenary vessel is heading toward<br>
    these coordinates in...<br>
    (works)<br>
    ... the Hyralan Sector.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Their maximum speed is warp eight<br>
    point seven... it will take them<br>
    at least fourteen hours to reach<br>
    that position.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We could be there in five.</p>
  <p> Data turns to Worf.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (annoyed)<br>
    Finally.</p>
  <p> Data reacts to the tone of irritation in Worf's voice,<br>
    but says nothing as Worf tends to the business at hand.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing, to Con<br>
    Officer)<br>
    Set course for the Hyralan Sector<br>
    and engage at warp nine.</p>

  <p> Data moves quietly to Worf.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Lieutenant, may I see you in the<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> Data and Worf EXIT.</p>
  <p>15 INT. READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Data and Worf ENTER. Once the doors close, Data turns<br>
    around and confronts Worf without preamble.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Lieutenant, I am dissatisfied with<br>
    your performance as acting first<br>
    officer.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    May I... ask in what way?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You continually question my orders<br>
    in front of the crew. I do not<br>
    think this is appropriate<br>
    behavior.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir... with all due respect, I<br>
    have always felt free to voice my<br>
    opinions... even when they<br>
    differed from those of Captain<br>
    Picard or Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is true. But in those<br>
    situations, you were acting as<br>
    head of security, not as First<br>
    Officer. The primary role of the<br>
    second in command is to carry out<br>
    the decisions of the Captain... in<br>
    this case, me.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But is it not my duty to offer<br>
    you... alternatives?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - REV. 08/06/93 - ACT TWO 16.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. But once I have made a<br>
    decision, it is your job to carry<br>
    it out regardless of how you may<br>
    personally feel. Any further<br>
    objections should be given to me<br>
    in private, not in front of the<br>
    crew.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I do not recall Commander Riker<br>
    ever publicly showing irritation<br>
    with his Captain as you did a<br>
    moment ago.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (abashed)<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If you feel that you are not<br>
    capable of carrying out this role,<br>
    I can assign it to Commander La<br>
    Forge and return you to Tactical.<br>
    I would not enter it as a<br>
    reprimand on your record... simply<br>
    as a transfer.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I would... prefer to remain at my<br>
    current post.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then I will expect you to conform<br>
    to the guidelines I have laid out.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf turns to go, then Data stops him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Mister Worf... I am sorry if I<br>
    have ended our friendship.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at him for a moment... suddenly feeling a<br>
    sense of remorse at his behavior.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir... it is I who has jeopardized<br>
    our friendship, not you. If you<br>
    will... overlook this incident, I<br>
    would like to continue to consider<br>
    myself your friend.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I would like that as well.</p>

  <p> Baran and Riker are standing over Narik, who is working<br>
    at his engineering console. Vekor is working at a<br>
    console in the b.g.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    (with an edge)<br>
    Your time is almost up, Narik. I<br>
    need warp power.</p>
  <p> NARIK<br>
    (working)<br>
    You can't rush this, Baran... if<br>
    the constrictor coil isn't<br>
    perfectly aligned, the entire antimatter<br>
    containment unit could<br>
    rupture... and that would be the<br>
    end of the engines, the ship, and<br>
    us.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    (brusque)<br>
    I don't have time for your<br>
    excuses. We have a schedule to<br>
    keep.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Can you do this any faster?</p>
  <p> Riker notes that Baran's hand has dropped to his<br>
    control device... a word from Riker and Narik is dead.<br>
    Narik realizes this as well and he gives Riker a<br>
    worried look. Riker looks over the console, seems to<br>
    consider this.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think Narik may be right this<br>
    time... a constrictor coil will<br>
    only align so fast. We'll have to<br>
    wait.</p>

    How long?</p>
  <p> Riker studies the console for a moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'd say another hour, maybe less.</p>
  <p> Baran turns to Narik, a cold and unforgiving look on<br>
    his face.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    One hour.</p>
  <p> Narik returns to work with a renewed spirit of vigor as<br>
    Baran and Riker move away from him. Baran moves<br>
    casually to Vekor.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    (to Vekor)<br>
    Where is Galen?</p>
  <p> VEKOR<br>
    In his quarters.</p>
  <p> Baran gives Riker a meaningful look as he speaks, but<br>
    keeps his ovice casual.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    Typical. Everyone else is working<br>
    and he's asleep. Someone should<br>
    go kick him out of bed.</p>
  <p> Riker gives a slight nod... he understands what Baran<br>
    wants of him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll take care of it.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    Good.</p>

  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>18 INT. MERCENARY SHIP - PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> A small, cramped room with only the barest of<br>
    accommodations. Picard is looking over a PADD when the<br>
    door suddenly OPENS. Picard whirls instinctively and<br>
    whips out a phaser. Riker freezes in the open doorway<br>
    for a moment, then Picard motions him inside.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - REV. 08/10/93 - ACT TWO 19.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    (wry)<br>
    It's good to see you, too.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've had a few... unpleasant<br>
    surprises.<br>
    (puts the phaser away)<br>
    This isn't a good idea, Wil.<br>
    Baran may get suspicious.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    As a matter of fact, Baran's the<br>
    one who sent me here.<br>
    (off his look)<br>
    He told me to &quot;wake you up,&quot; but<br>
    he really wants me to &quot;pretend&quot; to<br>
    get friendly with you and then<br>
    help you organize a mutiny... so<br>
    he can find your supporters among<br>
    the crew and eliminate them.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    So here I am... pretending to like<br>
    you after all.</p>
  <p> Picard can't help but smile a little at the irony of it<br>
    all.</p>

    Wheels within wheels... I'm<br>
    starting to forget which side I'm<br>
    on.<br>

    All right... what have you found<br>
    out so far?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    When we get to the Hyralan Sector,<br>
    we're supposed to rendezvous with<br>
    a Klingon transport ship. I'm not<br>
    sure, but I think they might be<br>
    delivering another Romulan<br>
    artifact to us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    A second artifact... ?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    By the way, these artifacts aren't<br>
    Romulan... they're Vulcan.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Vulcan?</p>

  <p> Picard hands the PADD he was studying to Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've been looking over the glyphs<br>
    and pictograms I found on the<br>
    Calder Two artifact. There's not<br>
    enough data to translate the<br>
    inscription, but the alphabet and<br>
    symbology are more consistent with<br>
    early Vulcan artifacts than<br>
    Romulan.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do these artifacts have some kind<br>
    of religious or cultural<br>
    significance... something that<br>
    would make them valuable enough to<br>
    kill for?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know.<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    If I could just get access to the<br>
    Enterprise computer for even a few<br>
    moments...</p>
  <p> Picard takes a few steps in the cramped room, trying to<br>
    think. A long beat, then he starts to think in a<br>
    different direction.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What will Baran do once we obtain<br>
    the second artifact?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're supposed to confirm it's<br>
    authentic...<br>
    (beat)<br>

    you and take your place.</p>
  <p> They exchange a look.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (dry)<br>
    You always seem to be after my<br>

  <p> Riker smiles at the joke, then Picard gets serious<br>
    again. He touches the device on the side of his neck.</p>

    I don't know what you're talking<br>
    about.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    I will not play games with you.<br>
    I found the message you sent to<br>
    the Enterprise. When Riker used<br>
    his command codes to drop their<br>
    shields, you sent a transmission<br>
    to them on the same carrier wave.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You're a Starfleet officer.</p>
  <p> As Picard starts to protest --</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    Do not bother to deny it. It is<br>

    That is correct. I infiltrated<br>

    investigate a possible threat to<br>
    Vulcan.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Tallera nods... this confirms her thinking.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    Very well. To answer your<br>
    question, for several years, there<br>
    has been a small, but growing<br>
    movement of extreme isolationists<br>
    on Vulcan... a group that believes<br>
    contact with alien races has<br>
    &quot;polluted&quot; our culture... and is<br>
    destroying Vulcan purity.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    This group advocates the total<br>
    isolation of Vulcan from the rest<br>
    of the galaxy and the eradication<br>
    of all alien influences from our<br>
    planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It sounds like a very... illogical<br>
    philosophy.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    Agreed. But extremists often have<br>
    a logic all their own.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What are these artifacts we're<br>
    collecting? I know they're Vulcan<br>

  <p> TALLERA<br>
    I am sure you are familiar with<br>
    the ancient history of my<br>
    people... before we found<br>
    logic... before we found peace.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You were much like my people once<br>
    were... a warlike, savage race...</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    There was even a time when we used<br>
    our telepathic abilities as a<br>
    weapon... a time when we learned<br>
    to kill with a thought.</p>
  <p> That triggers something in Picard's memory.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Stone of Gol... ?</p>
  <p> Tallera looks at him, mildly surprised.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    You know of it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know the story from Vulcan<br>
    mythology. According to the<br>
    legend whoever possessed the stone<br>
    needed only to think of throwing<br>
    it at someone... and that person<br>
    would be killed.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    The Stone of Gol is real, but<br>
    there is nothing magical or<br>
    supernatural about it.<br>

  <p> TALLERA (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It is a psionic resonator... a<br>
    device which focuses and amplifies<br>
    telepathic energy. It is one of<br>
    the most devastating weapons ever<br>
    conceived.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As I recall the legend, the Stone<br>
    of Gol was destroyed by the gods<br>
    when the Vulcan people found the<br>
    way to peace...</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    The resonator was believed to have<br>
    been destroyed during the Time of<br>
    the Awakening. Only one piece was<br>
    known to have survived and it was<br>
    placed in a Vulcan museum under<br>
    heavy guard.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Six months ago, that piece was<br>
    stolen from the museum. Soon<br>
    after, mercenary ships began<br>
    raiding archaeological sites<br>
    across the quadrant. We believe<br>
    that a member of the isolationist<br>
    movement is trying to reassemble<br>
    the resonator.</p>
  <p> Picard is disturbed by the implications.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A telepathic weapon...</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    A Vulcan trained in the mental<br>
    disciplines would be a formidable<br>
    assassin. The entire Vulcan<br>
    council could be killed with a<br>
    single thought, and there would be<br>
    no defense.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    My orders are to find that would-be<br>
    assassin and stop him.</p>

    Since Baran will presumably need<br>
    to deliver the artifacts to this<br>
    assassin in order to get paid, it<br>
    would seem that the best course of<br>
    action is to continue with our<br>
    little masquerade for now.</p>

    Agreed. But Captain... I cannot<br>

    assembled. If necessary, I will<br>

  <p> Riker, Picard, Narik and the N.D. Mercenaries suddenly<br>
    MATERIALIZE in the room. Data leaps up, but the<br>
    Mercenaries have the drop on them all and there's<br>
    nothing he can do.</p>
  <p> KORAL<br>
    (outraged)<br>
    What is this?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Quiet.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Does he have it?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - 08/06/93 - ACT FOUR 39.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard quickly scans Koral with his tricorder... then<br>
    reaches into a pocket on Koral's uniform and pulls out<br>
    a small ARTIFACT which is similar in shape and design<br>
    to the artifact identified by Picard in the Mercenary<br>
    cargo hold.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is it.</p>
  <p> NARIK<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Are you sure, Galen?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, I recognize the inscription<br>
    pattern from the first artifact.</p>
  <p> Data and Troi have been quietly watching all this,<br>
    trying to figure out just what to do. Data finally<br>
    decides that the obvious thing to say is probably the<br>
    correct one.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander Riker, by taking this<br>
    action you risk charges of<br>
    assault, theft, piracy, and<br>
    treason.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Really? Then I guess adding one<br>
    more charge wouldn't hurt.</p>
  <p> With that, Riker turns and points his phaser at Picard,<br>
    but Picard is faster and he jumps out of the way as<br>
    Riker FIRES. The shot MISSES and Picard rolls out of<br>
    the way and FIRES at Riker, catching him in the chest.<br>
    Riker goes down. Everyone is shocked as Picard picks<br>
    himself off the deck. Troi quickly moves to Riker and<br>
    checks his pulse.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is he dead?</p>
  <p> Troi looks at him for a beat, and then gives him the<br>
    answer she hopes he wants to hear.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes.</p>

  <p> GIUSTI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Data bends down to examine Riker.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    He's all right. He's just<br>
    stunned.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I must admit I am experiencing the<br>
    same sensation.</p>
  <p> Riker begins to come to on the deck. He looks up at<br>
    them and tries to blink away the cobwebs.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is going to take some time to<br>
    explain...</p>

    Set course three one zero mark two<br>
    one five, warp six.</p>
  <p> Picard, Narik, and the other N.D. Mercenaries ENTER the<br>
    Bridge. Picard strides right up to Baran, his face set<br>
    in anger, but Baran regards him coolly.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    Where is it?</p>
  <p> Picard pulls out the artifact and tosses it to Baran.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh, I do have something else for<br>
    you...</p>
  <p> Baran looks up and then Picard suddenly PUNCHES Baran<br>
    right in the mouth, knocking him back off his feet.<br>
    Everything on the Bridge comes to a stop as people turn<br>
    to watch this turn of events. Picard faces the Bridge<br>
    crew, his tone and bearing flushed with anger.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tell them what happened, Narik.</p>
  <p> NARIK<br>
    Riker turned on us... he tried to<br>
    kill Galen before we beamed back.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He might have killed all of us.<br>
    And I believe he was acting on the<br>
    direct orders of Baran.<br>
    (looks at Baran)<br>
    You betrayed us.</p>
  <p> Baran gets back on his feet, rage flickering behind his<br>
    eyes... but he warily glances around at the faces of<br>
    his crew, trying to read their expressions -- who will<br>
    they support? Picard rushes on, not giving Baran a<br>
    chance to rebut him.</p>

  <p>30 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I say this has gone on long<br>
    enough. It's time for a new<br>
    commander... someone who will<br>
    lead us to the profits we've been<br>
    promised.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    And who would that be? You,<br>
    Galen?<br>
    (to all)<br>
    He's plotted this all along...<br>
    opposed me at every turn...<br>
    endangered all of us with his<br>
    stubborn refusal to follow orders.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A refusal to follow your orders...<br>
    the orders of a small man trying<br>
    to fill a role too big for him.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    I have kept this crew alive... I<br>
    am about to bring us more profits<br>
    than any of --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to all)<br>
    More promises of riches. More<br>
    excuses for Baran to fill his own<br>
    coffers while the rest of us go<br>
    begging. I say it's time for a<br>
    change. Who's with me?</p>
  <p> A tense moment... then Tallera, Narik and two N.D.s<br>
    move to stand with Picard. Vekor hesitates, then goes<br>
    to Picard, along with one more N.D. Baran is alone...<br>
    he can see the writing on the wall and he feels<br>
    cornered.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    It's over, Baran.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    Not quite.</p>
  <p> He pulls out the control device... everyone glances at<br>
    it with a sense of apprehension. The device is Baran's<br>
    trump card and they know it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - 08/06/93 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    As long as I have this, I'm still<br>
    in command.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You can't kill us all... you need<br>
    us to run the ship more than we<br>
    need you to command it.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    I don't need to kill you all...<br>
    just you, Galen. Somehow I think<br>
    that watching you writhe in your<br>
    death throes may change a few<br>
    minds... and a few is all I need.</p>
  <p> He lifts the device, sets it to kill and prepares to<br>
    press the button...</p>

  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>31 INT. MERCENARY BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Continuous from Act Four. Baran presses the button on<br>
    the control device and then suddenly Baran grabs his<br>
    own neck in pain and drops to the floor, dead -- a<br>
    stunned look on his face. Everyone is shocked except<br>
    Picard, who moves to Baran's body and takes the control<br>
    device out of his limp hand. Tallera moves to him.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> Picard's expression is grim... he regrets this, but<br>
    felt he had no choice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I switched our transponder codes.<br>
    It seemed like a prudent, if<br>
    regrettable step.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    Baran was nothing. We have a<br>
    mission to complete...<br>
    (with meaning)<br>
    ... and the crew needs a leader.</p>
  <p> Picard turns away from Baran and faces the Bridge crew<br>
    who are all looking to him. He looks down at the<br>
    control device in his hand... then deliberately sets it<br>
    on the deck, pulls his weapon and DESTROYS it with a<br>
    phaser blast.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There'll be no more &quot;punishment&quot;<br>
    on this ship. Do your duties and<br>
    I'll see to it that we complete<br>
    our mission... and get our<br>
    payment.</p>
  <p> A long beat as the crew looks at him... they glance at<br>
    each other... then finally return to their places on<br>
    the Bridge. Tallera picks up the artifact from where<br>
    Baran dropped it.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    (to Narik, re: Baran's<br>
    body)<br>
    Remove that.</p>
  <p> Narik begins dragging Baran's body off the Bridge.</p>

  <p> VEKOR<br>
    Aye... Captain.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Put it through in here.</p>
  <p> The desktop MONITOR is activated, and we see the image<br>
    of SATOK -- a middle-aged Vulcan male, appear on the<br>
    screen.</p>
  <p> SATOK<br>
    Greetings, Commander. How may I<br>
    be of service?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Minister, I wanted to let you know<br>
    that the mercenary ship which has<br>
    been raiding planets in the Taugan<br>
    sector is probably on its way to<br>
    Vulcan right now.</p>
  <p> SATOK<br>
    I do not understand.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - REV. 08/10/93 - ACT FIVE 46.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sorry. It's been a difficult<br>
    couple of days.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I know that one of your operatives<br>
    has been investigating the<br>
    assembly of the psionic resonator<br>
    on a mercenary ship for several<br>
    months. I didn't want someone to<br>
    make a mistake and start firing at<br>
    them when they approach your<br>
    planet.</p>
  <p> A long beat as Satok thinks. He looks at Riker with a<br>
    puzzled expression.</p>
  <p> SATOK<br>
    Commander, I believe there is a<br>
    problem.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We have no operative aboard a<br>
    mercenary ship.</p>
  <p> Riker looks blankly at the screen for a moment... then<br>
    he starts to realize. OFF Riker's shocked reaction...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>34 INT. BARAN'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Picard and Tallera are at the computer console which<br>
    has a great deal of text information on the screen.<br>
    The two pieces of the resonator are sitting on a nearby<br>
    table.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (off monitor)<br>
    According to Baran's logs, the two<br>
    artifacts are supposed to be<br>
    delivered... to the T'Karath<br>
    Sanctuary on Vulcan.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    I know that place. It was an<br>
    underground stronghold for one of<br>
    the factions during the last civil<br>
    war. It's been abandoned for<br>
    centuries.</p>
  <p> Picard hits his combadge.</p>

    Galen to Bridge. Alter course for<br>
    Vulcan.</p>
  <p> VEKOR'S COM VOICE<br>
    Understood.</p>
  <p> Picard sits back and his gaze is drawn to the two<br>
    pieces of the resonator on the table. His curiosity is<br>
    piqued and he carefully examines them...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Tallera)<br>
    Perhaps you can help me with<br>
    something... I've been able to<br>
    translate most of the writing on<br>
    these pieces...</p>
  <p>34A INSERT - ON RESONATOR PIECES</p>
  <p> Picard picks up the two pieces together and runs his<br>
    fingers over the intricate inscriptions.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S VOICE<br>
    For the most part, they're just<br>
    warnings of death and destruction<br>
    for those who oppose the<br>
    resonator...</p>
  <p>34B RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> As before. Picard turns the large piece over and shows<br>
    Tallera the bottom of the base piece.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But this hieroglyph on the<br>
    anterior has me a bit puzzled.</p>
  <p>34C INSERT - ON BASE PIECE</p>
  <p> The bottom of the base has TWO large SYMBOLS -- one an<br>
    intricate series of circles and lines, the other a more<br>
    abstract drawing of heroic Vulcan figure. There is a<br>
    large NOTCH missing from the base at the point where<br>
    the third piece is supposed to fit into it. PART of a<br>
    jagged LINE borders the area of the missing piece --<br>
    it's incomplete, suggesting yet another symbol on the<br>
    other piece.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - REV. 08/10/93 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p>34C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD'S VOICE<br>
    This is clearly the Vulcan god of<br>
    war... and this is the god of<br>
    death...</p>
  <p>34D RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> Picard indicates the point where the missing piece<br>
    would fit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But if you look closely you can<br>
    see that there is a third symbol<br>
    missing -- which should be on the<br>
    final piece. The odd thing is<br>
    that typically, the gods of war<br>
    and death would stand alone on an<br>
    artifact... they would never be<br>
    combined with a third glyph.</p>
  <p> Tallera looks it over for a moment.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    Fascinating. But I am not an<br>
    archaeological expert.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hmmmm. I'm anxious to see the<br>
    final artifact... it may provide<br>
    a new insight into Vulcan<br>
    mythology.</p>
  <p> Picard continues to look at the pieces. Tallera brings<br>
    them back to the business at hand.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    When we arrive at Vulcan, I will<br>
    take these pieces to a secure<br>
    holding area before going to the<br>
    Sanctuary. I prefer to go<br>
    alone... it will arouse less<br>
    suspicion among the isolationists.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods agreement)<br>
    We shouldn't have any problems<br>
    entering orbit.<br>

  <p>34D CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    I told Commander Riker to contact<br>
    the Vulcan authorities from the<br>
    Enterprise and warn them of our<br>
    approach.</p>
  <p> Tallera is caught off-guard by this and her face<br>
    momentarily registers surprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (off her reaction)<br>
    I didn't want to risk a<br>
    misunderstanding... someone might<br>
    have mistaken this for an actual<br>
    raid...</p>
  <p> Picard trails off... he saw the quick look of shock on<br>
    Tallera's face... he's beginning to feel that something<br>
    is definitely not right here.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    (covering)<br>
    It was a wise precaution.</p>
  <p> A beat. Picard's suspicions have been raised by this<br>
    quick look of surprise... he begins to probe around a<br>
    bit, watching her reactions carefully.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps I should contact the<br>
    Enterprise... have them meet us<br>
    at Vulcan in case these<br>
    isolationists try to escape.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    Your offer is appreciated... but<br>
    our security forces are more than<br>
    adequate.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Are you sure it's wise for you to<br>
    go to the Sanctuary alone? After<br>
    all, they're expecting Baran to<br>
    show up, not you. If I<br>
    accompanied you, it may seem more<br>
    plausible that --</p>

    Captain, I understand your human<br>
    emotional need to be there at the<br>
    final moment... but this is a<br>
    Vulcan matter.</p>
  <p> Tallera has given him perfectly valid answers to all<br>
    his questions... he smiles in agreement, but there is<br>
    still something bothering him at the back of his mind.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    Thank you.</p>

  <p> VEKOR<br>
    We have entered orbit of Vulcan.</p>
  <p> Tallera takes the two pieces of the resonator and moves<br>
    toward the transporter pad. But Picard stops her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tallera... I've decided on a<br>
    change of plan. Leave one<br>
    artifact here for now. Take the<br>
    other... and once we have our<br>
    payment in hand, we'll complete<br>
    the delivery.</p>
  <p> Tallera looks at him, trying to gauge what he's up to.<br>
    This is a delicate game being played out in full view<br>
    of the mercenary crew.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    That was not the agreement.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I realize that. But it would be<br>
    safer for all concerned if we kept<br>
    one piece here.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    They will not pay us until they<br>
    get both pieces.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They've waited a long time for<br>
    this. They won't take any risks<br>
    at this stage. Take the piece and<br>
    beam down.</p>
  <p> Tallera holds his gaze for a moment. After a beat, she<br>
    decides on a bolder move. She moves to him,<br>
    confronting Picard directly. Again her words are meant<br>
    for the benefit of the crew, who are watching them both<br>
    closely.</p>

    You'll find a<br>
    message secretly transmitted to<br>
    the Enterprise, containing our<br>
    entire flight plan.</p>
  <p> There are shocked reactions around the Bridge. Vekor<br>
    goes to the navigational console and works for a<br>
    moment. Picard knows she has him dead to rights and he<br>
    can't deny it.</p>
  <p> VEKOR<br>
    (shocked, off monitor)<br>
    She's right.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    That message was sent by Galen...<br>
    he's a Starfleet officer.</p>
  <p> The crew reacts with dismay. Narik grabs a phaser and<br>
    points it at Picard.</p>
  <p> NARIK<br>
    (to Tallera)<br>
    Why didn't you tell us before?</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    I wasn't sure until he tried to<br>
    stop me from taking the artifacts<br>
    to the surface. Then I knew he<br>
    was intentionally obstructing our<br>
    plans to keep us from being paid.</p>
  <p> Picard's mind races... looking for a counter move.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tallera's right, I am a Starfleet<br>
    officer... but what she's not<br>
    telling you is that those<br>
    artifacts in her hand are part of<br>
    an incredibly powerful weapon.<br>
    There's no reward waiting for you<br>
    down on the surface. Tallera will<br>
    take the artifacts and leave you<br>
    here, to be captured by Starfleet.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - REV. 08/10/93 - ACT FIVE 50A.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Everyone looks at Tallera, who has to think fast. She<br>
    looks at them.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    I've served on this ship for<br>
    almost a year now... fought by<br>
    your sides... protected you from<br>
    Baran when I could... and now I've<br>
    exposed a spy in our midst.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I think I've proven my loyalty.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to others)<br>
    You know Tallera... you know she's<br>
    a woman of great patience. She's<br>
    bided her time and waited for this<br>
    moment. All she cares about is<br>
    assembling that weapon. If she<br>
    leaves this ship you'll never see<br>
    her again.</p>
  <p> There's a beat as they consider this.</p>
  <p> VEKOR<br>
    (to Tallera)<br>
    I don't care what it is you want,<br>
    Tallera. I don't care if that's<br>
    a weapon for your private use or<br>
    if you're really just making a<br>
    delivery as planned. All I care<br>
    about is my money.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    So I propose a compromise. Narik<br>
    and I will go with you to the<br>
    surface to guarantee we receive<br>
    payment. After that, you can go<br>
    wherever you want.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    Agreed.<br>
    (re: Picard)<br>
    Bring him as well. We can use him<br>
    as a hostage if Starfleet<br>
    arrives... if not we'll kill him<br>
    on the surface.</p>
  <p> Picard has little choice in the matter as Narik nods<br>
    and roughly shoves him toward the pad.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - 08/06/93 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>37 INT. VULCAN CAVERN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> This used to be a hideaway for Vulcan soldiers over two<br>
    thousand years ago -- think of the catacombs where<br>
    Christians used to hide from the Romans. The cavern<br>
    itself is dark and gloomy, and there are remnants of<br>
    decaying Vulcan artifacts lying around... some cracked<br>
    and peeling glyphs on the walls... a very old and dusty<br>
    place. A crude stone altar dominates the room. In<br>
    front of the altar is a modern storage CONTAINER.</p>
  <p> Tallera, Vekor, Narik, and Picard MATERIALIZE next to<br>
    the altar and look around. Tallera indicates the<br>
    storage container.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    There. Your reward as promised.</p>
  <p> Vekor heads for the storage container while Narik<br>
    guards Picard. Tallera moves to the altar and picks up<br>
    the third piece of the resonator and begins to link it<br>
    to the other two.</p>
  <p>37A ON PICARD</p>
  <p> as he reacts to something with puzzlement...</p>
  <p>37B POV PICARD - CLOSE ON THIRD PIECE</p>
  <p> The underside of the third piece has a unique Vulcan<br>
    symbol on it. As Tallera assembles the resonator, this<br>
    symbol falls neatly into place with the other two<br>
    symbols we have seen earlier.</p>
  <p>37C RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> as Vekor OPENS the storage container and examines the<br>
    bars of gold-pressed latinum within.</p>
  <p> NARIK<br>
    Is it all there?</p>
  <p> VEKOR<br>
    No. This is less than half of<br>
    what we were promised.<br>
    (to Tallera)<br>
    Where is the rest of it?</p>
  <p> Tallera never takes her eyes off the resonator -- it's<br>
    fully assembled now.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - 08/06/93 - ACT FIVE 51A.</p>
  <p>37C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    That is all I could manage. I<br>
    suggest you take it and leave.</p>
  <p> Narik stands and points his phaser directly at Tallera.</p>
  <p> NARIK<br>
    I did not come this far to be<br>
    cheated. I want it all. Now.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - 08/06/93 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>37C CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Tallera turns to him and a DISSONANT CHORD can be heard<br>
    in the room... it quickly increases in volume and there<br>
    is a sense of growing power in the room.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    Very well. You will get what you<br>
    deserve.</p>
  <p>38 ON NARIK (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As a DISTORTION suddenly appears in the air in front of<br>
    him... he gives it a puzzled look for a moment, and<br>
    then a LOUD CRACKLE of energy BLOWS him backwards<br>
    across the cavern as if by an unseen hand... he falls<br>
    to the floor, dead.</p>
  <p>39 VEKOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Reacts to Narik's death and points her phaser at<br>
    Tallera, but she's too late -- the DISTORTION appears<br>
    in front of her and then Vekor is also killed.</p>
  <p>40 WIDER</p>
  <p> As Picard faces Tallera alone in the silent cavern.<br>
    His eyes automatically drop to one of the phasers lying<br>
    nearby on the ground -- but it will do him little good<br>
    in these circumstances.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    Go ahead, Captain. Pick up the<br>
    phaser. See what good it will do.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You can't win, Tallera. Starfleet<br>
    won't stand by while you tear<br>
    apart one of the founding worlds<br>
    of the Federation.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    How little you understand what you<br>
    are facing, Captain.</p>
  <p> She takes a few steps toward him... a cat toying with<br>
    her prey.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - REV. 08/10/93 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You are used to fighting enemies<br>
    like yourself... people on ships<br>
    with energy weapons, defense<br>
    shields, warp drives... but this<br>
    is unlike anything you have ever<br>
    faced. This is the power of the<br>
    mind.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Pick up the phaser, Captain.</p>
  <p> A tense beat... then suddenly:</p>
  <p>41 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As Riker, Worf, and TWO N.D. SECURITY GUARDS<br>
    MATERIALIZE in the cavern. Tallera whirls around to<br>
    deal with this new threat, but Picard makes a sudden<br>
    realization and shouts to his officers...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Drop your weapons! Do it!</p>
  <p> Riker and the others respond instinctively to Picard's<br>
    command and they drop their weapons.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Make no aggressive movements. The<br>
    resonator amplifys violent<br>
    thoughts and emotions.</p>
  <p> The officers do as they're told. Tallera concentrates<br>
    on them and the DISSONANT CHORD is heard building in<br>
    the room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Tallera)<br>
    That's why you wanted me to take<br>
    the phaser -- and why you were<br>
    able to kill Narik and Vekor. It<br>
    wasn't until I saw the image on<br>
    the last artifact... that I<br>
    realized what the message on the<br>
    resonator was.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The third image is the Vulcan<br>
    symbol for peace... that symbol is<br>
    positioned between the symbols for<br>
    war and death.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - REV. 08/10/93 - ACT FIVE 53A.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    It's a warning... that the<br>
    resonator's power can be overcome<br>
    by peace.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    You're about to see how wrong you<br>
    are.</p>
  <p> The DISSONANT CHORD grows in volume.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - REV. 08/11/93 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to officers)<br>
    Clear your minds of all aggressive<br>
    thoughts...</p>
  <p> Tallera concentrates... clearly this is a great effort<br>
    for her.</p>
  <p>42 ON RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As the DISTORTION forms in front of him. He steels<br>
    himself... tries to ignore it... closes his eyes...<br>
    and then the distortion PASSES DIRECTLY THROUGH HIM<br>
    without harm.</p>
  <p>43 TALLERA</p>
  <p> Reacts... the effort tired her.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Think, Tallera -- two thousand<br>
    years ago, your people were being<br>
    consumed by war... then they found<br>
    the way of peace and logic.<br>
    During the same period, the<br>
    resonator was dismantled... don't<br>
    you see the connection?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    When peace came to Vulcan, the<br>
    resonator became useless. That is<br>
    why it was dismantled.</p>
  <p> Tallera summons her strength and tries one more time.</p>
  <p>44 WORF (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> keeps himself calm... as a DISTORTION forms and passes<br>
    THROUGH HIM.</p>
  <p>45 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Tallera sags to one knee... sweat pouring down her<br>
    forehead... the effort is exhausting her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - 08/06/93 - ACT FIVE 54A.</p>
  <p>45 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    You were right... the resonator<br>
    cannot be stopped with phasers or<br>
    shields. But like every other<br>
    form of violence... it can be<br>
    stopped with peace.</p>
  <p> Tallera glares up at him... makes one final effort...<br>
    but the DISSONANT CHORD only briefly grows in volume...<br>
    then fades away completely. Tallera drops the<br>
    resonator to the ground.</p>
  <p> Picard quietly moves to the resonator... picks it up...<br>
    and carefully removes the pieces. It's finally over.<br>
    OFF his expression...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part II&quot; - REV. 08/10/93 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>46 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship in orbit around Vulcan.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log: Stardate 47169.2.<br>
    Security Minister Satok has taken<br>
    Tallera into custody and begun a<br>
    search for the rest of the<br>
    isolationists.</p>
  <p>47 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker and Data are walking through the<br>
    Corridor. Picard is still dressed in his Mercenary<br>
    outfit. Mid-conversation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Once we realized you weren't on<br>
    the mercenary ship, we scanned the<br>
    surface for your neural implant...<br>
    and tracked the signal to the<br>
    cavern.</p>
  <p> Picard nods in understanding.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What will happen to the resonator?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Satok assured me that all three<br>
    pieces will be destroyed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is unfortunate that it cannot<br>
    be studied. The resonator is a<br>
    key artifact from a remarkable<br>
    period of history.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Normally, I would be the first to<br>
    agree with you... but perhaps<br>
    there are some things best left in<br>
    the past.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's going to happen to the<br>
    mercenaries?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They have been detained by the<br>
    Vulcan authorities, for the<br>
    moment.<br>

    But they're also facing charges<br>
    from the Klingons, the<br>
    Cardassians, the Ferengi, and<br>
    about seven other worlds. We<br>
    won't be hearing from them for<br>
    quite some time.</p>
  <p> They stop outside Picard's quarters.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One, set course for<br>

  <p>47 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (with humor)<br>
    Wait a minute... You were declared<br>
    dead, remember? You can't give<br>
    orders around here.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles at the joke, but Data misses the humor<br>
    and thinks for a moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    If we are to adhere to the exact<br>
    letter of Starfleet regulations,<br>
    then technically sir, you have<br>
    been declared a renegade. In<br>
    fact, I believe you are facing<br>
    twelve counts of court martial<br>
    offenses. You cannot give orders<br>
    either.</p>
  <p> Picard is quick to jump on this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Quite right. I'm going to get<br>
    some sleep. In the meantime I<br>
    suggest you escort Commander Riker<br>
    to the brig.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS to his quarters and Data takes Riker by<br>
    the arm.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This way, sir...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, he was just joking... you<br>
    know that, right? Data?</p>
  <p> As they head off down the Corridor...</p>
